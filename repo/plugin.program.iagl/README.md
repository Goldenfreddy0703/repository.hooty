![](https://i.imgur.com/nQfTbZq.png?display=inline-block) Internet Archive Game Launcher
==========================

The Internet Archive Game Launcher (IAGL - /eye/gull/) will launch games from the internet using [Kodi](http://kodi.tv)

IAGL is *FREE*, as in beer. As in no money. As in gratis.

Installation
-------------

Do *NOT* use a third party installer, build, TVA Link, fusion installer, or other non-official means to install IAGL.  Doing so is akin to clubbing baby seals.

Install IAGL in one of these ways:

- Download the repository zipfile from [here](https://github.com/zach-morris/repository.zachmorris/raw/master/repository.zachmorris/repository.zachmorris-1.0.0.zip) to install the addon and get automatic updates.

or

- Download the latest version zipfile from [here](https://github.com/zach-morris/repository.zachmorris/tree/master/plugin.program.iagl) to install by zipfile.

**NOTE**
The addon in the repository is for Kodi v19 now.
Users of Kodi v18 or earlier have to manually install v2.X of the addon from [here](https://github.com/zach-morris/repository.zachmorris/tree/master/plugin.program.iagl) (there is no more repository for the old version).
