		<emu_comment>The Amiga CD32 is the first 32-bit home video game console released in western Europe, Australia, Canada and Brazil. It was based on Commodore's Advanced Graphics Architecture chipset, and is of similar specification to the Amiga 1200 computer. Using third party devices, it is possible to upgrade the CD32 with keyboard, floppy drive, hard drive, RAM and mouse, turning it into the equivalent of an Amiga 1200 personal computer. The CD32 is capable of running most of the titles developed for the Amiga CDTV multimedia device, but differences in CPU speed and Kickstart version prevent some of the earlier CDTV titles from running. Many of the games released for the CD32 are simply ports of games that are already available for Amiga computers. One benefit of this is that, when appropriate, many games retain the ability to use an Amiga mouse (in port 2) or Amiga keyboard (plugged into the AUX port).[CR]Developer:  Commodore[CR]Manufacturer:  Commodore[CR]CPU:  Motorola 68EC020[CR]Memory:  2 MB[CR]Graphics:  Advanced Graphics Architecture[CR]Sound:  4 × 8-bit PCM channels (2 stereo channels)[CR]Display:  320×256[CR]Media:  CD[CR]Max Controllers:  2</emu_comment>

		<title_clean>ATR - All Terrain Racing</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR]Like many amiga racers from the era ATR was a top down racer. This meant that the games only viewpoint was from high in the sky looking down on the track. Handling was based on drifting around corners and slamming into opponents. The vehicles in ATR are all "buggyish" in their nature with a futuristic slant on the stylings. This futuristic styling was carried over into some of the assets in the level design leading you to think that the whole game was set in the near future. Unlike many of the top down racers of the time tracks had short cuts which added an element of strategy. As well as shortcuts tracks also had environmental hazards you had to avoid such as oil slicks and small jumps. Tracks also had turns that were not just 90 degrees in nature (a shortcoming of ATR's precursor Overdrive). Pickups such as turbos where littered about the track.Shopping for gearYou could also upgrade your car in ATR with advanced engines, gearing systems, tyres and fuel, all of which could be customised to the terrain you were racing in.ATR also was one of the first games to feature in game advertising. Admittedly all the advertising was for team 17's own games such as ALIEN BREED and BODY BLOWS but this was a precursor to the beast that is in game advertising nowadays.In game advertising circa 1995[CR]</plot>

		<plot>Akira is a side-scrolling action game based on the anime film of the same title.[CR]In the first few levels you have to guide the main character Kaneda through an obstruction filled road on his motorcycle. Obstacles come in the form of roadblocks, holes in the road, which must be jumped with the use of a ramp, and a variety of characters on the road who throw bombs at you. The roadblocks can only be cleared by grenades which you pick up by knocking over traffic cones. You must also make it to the end of the level without running out of fuel.[CR]After the motorcycle levels there are five platform levels. The object of these levels is basically to kill everyone you come in contact with, each kill adding to a meter which you have to fill to complete the level.</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Alfred Chicken is a 1993 platformer developed by Twilight Games, and published by Mindscape for multiple platforms. The eponymous main character is able to jump and glide, but not directly attack enemies unless he is diving down fast while gliding. In order to complete each level, the player has to have Alfred peck all of the balloons that are tied down in various parts of the levels. Once all of the balloons have been pecked, a boss is fought to complete the level.[CR]For a publicity stunt to promote the game Karl Fitzhugh, an employee of Mindscape, ran for a political office as the Alfred Chicken party candidate in Christchurch, Dorset, England. Unsurprisingly, he did not win.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>A scientific outpost on a far off planet has been attacked. Nothing is known about the attackers, since all communications have been destroyed. A team of marines is dispatched to investigate and destroy the unknown invaders. As their dropships enter the atmosphere and approach the base, the defence lasers, damaged in the onslaught, move into action. They launch wild bursts of laser fire at the approaching marines, who are not prepared and take heavy losses. Rookies Nash and Jordan crash-land, and must fight off the alien force.[CR]As with the previous Alien Breed, the gameplay is viewed from above. Your soldier shoots his way through the levels, collecting keys, ammunition and credits along the way. Computers can be logged into to buy new weapons. A new 'retreat' mode allows you to fire while moving backwards.[CR]The game is largely non-linear, as most levels have multiple exits, and the game can be moved through in different ways. There is a variety of indoor and outdoor levels, although you spend most time inside some of the multi-level towers. After activating a self-destruct mechanism, you must escape the building quickly.</plot>

		<plot>Team 17 were famed for pushing the Amiga to its limits, with a string of hits stretching back to 1991. The first major one was Alien Breed, a Gauntlet-style shoot 'em up which had already spawned 3 sequels, including a budget-priced 'special edition'.[CR]This release was in a similar vein, but set into a 3D context, making for the Amiga's first big Doom-style game. The 3D engine uses fairly small screen graphics, but these include full floors and ceilings with detailed shading, doors, vertical position variations, lifts and transporters. The CD version includes extra atmospheric sound, while fast processors and extra FastRAM are also supported.</plot>

You will also meet some characters, which if you give them an item they want, they will give you something in return.[CR]In other levels, you have to do things yourself. For example, obtain a snake that will set a prisoner free, or using a blow torch to open some frozen doors.[CR]Arabian Nights comes on two floppy disks, but a CD32 version is also available on 1 CD.</plot>

		<plot>A vertically-scrolling shoot 'em up from the old school, with similarities to games like 1942 and SWIV. There are lots of big, brash enemy vehicles to take on, plus individual soldiers (these often lie in a pool of blood afterwards, a gruesome sight making full use of AGA graphics) and civilians. Many of the enemies have good hiding places and can emerge surprisingly, Commando-style.[CR]There are four large levels, which also scroll a small amount horizontally, the idea being that you can evade some opposition. There's a special loop-the-loop type feature available, which can double as an attack or an evasive move.</plot>

		<plot>Base Jumpers was the second release by Aaron and Adam Fothergill's Shadow Software outfit for publisher Rasputin and was very simple in concept. In a 2D platform gaming style, players run up to the top of towers, trying to combine 3 letter pickups to collect plain daft bonuses (there were something like 500 different 3 letter combinations) and then jump off the building and base jump down the outside. The last player to avoid the sticky out bits of the building and successfully open their parachute before becoming pavement art wins the round.</plot>

		<plot>Battle Chess is a quite typical chess game, but it comes with a twist: all pieces are represented by small, realistic figures that walk around on the chessboard, and when one piece takes another, they both take part in an animated battle. There is a different animation for each permutation, depending on which pieces are capturing or being captured. You can also play in 2D without animation. [CR]The game's opening library includes 30,000 different moves, ensuring a variety of games will unfold across the 10 skill levels. [CR]Multi-player support can be extended to modem and/or serial port play.</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]As the video game market slowly turned towards the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and Sega Genesis, Rare Ltd released this game which can be considered one of the best looking games on the NES. The game begins aboard the space ship &#8216;The Vulture&#8217; where Battletoads Rash, Zitz, and Pimple (all disgustingly named after skin diseases) are escorting Princess Angelica back to her home planet. Pimple and Princess Angelica go cruisin&#8217; and get intercepted by the game&#8217;s villain, the Dark Queen of Ragnarok. Both are kidnapped and taken back to Ragnarok. The Professor, captain of The Vulture, takes Rash and Zitz to &#8216;rumble&#8217; with the Dark Queen on Ragnarok and &#8216;get the Princess and Pimple back.&#8217; The remainder of the game takes place on planet Ragnarok where Rash and Zitz set off to save their friend Pimple and Princess Angelica.Gameplay[CR]While the first level is a typical 2D beat em up similar to Double Dragon, other levels have a variety of gameplay styles, including rappelling down a pit, riding speed bikes and surfboards, navigating a level on a unicycle-like vehicle that can ride up walls and on the ceiling, etc. The main objective of each level is to defeat as many enemies and overcome as many obstacles as possible and reach the endpoint. General strategy is to memorize these obstacles[CR]and rely on quick reflexes to reach the end. The entire game rounds up to two difficult levels where the Toads climb a tower and, at the end, reach the Dark Queen.[CR]The most memorable aspect of this game is the absurd difficulty. Not only did it employ a decent amount of memorization but reflexes had to be fast, even for veteran gamers. Another memorable moment for this game would be the humorous way enemies were finished off, be it by using a football helmet or sprouting horns and ramming the enemy off screen.[CR]When the game was released on the Game Boy Electronic Gaming Monthly awarded it the scores of 8,8,8,7 saying, "...one of the best Game Boy games I've ever played". The Game Boy version had the same basic theme found in the NES adventure, with the toads using all of the same fighting moves. The levels and bosses however were entirely original.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>The Beavers Supergroup and their megastar leader Jethro have reached number one in the Charts and are a big hit in all of the forest discos. Unfortunately, the previous number one group, The Rappin' Rabbit Rockers, are very angry at the Beavers success. They put a plan into action. Jethro's wife was kidnapped and is being held hostage. She will not be released until the Beavers are disbanded and all their master tapes are destroyed. Jethro is determined not to let his Beaver comrades down. He sets off to rescue his kidnapped wife with the help of his children.[CR]You take the role of Jethro. The aim of the game is to make your way through each level of the game, overcoming the various Rabbits allies you will encounter. For every six levels of the game that you complete, you will be given a code so that he can continue his struggle at a later date. However, the Rabbits don't take too kindly to this, so they send their biggest and most dangerous followers to attack you just prior to him being given the code. To defeat these large beasts, use your spin attack to propel the missiles back at them. Watch out, as rocks are too heavy to bat with your tail and you will use an energy point in trying.[CR]If fighting is not enough, you must collect Charisma Stars to maintain your charisma that you will need to complete a level. [CR]There are also Life Stars which have the ability to give you another life, but to get these, you must sneak up on them or the will move out of your reach. To keep your helpful children from losing interest, you must find Raccoon Skin Hats to give as gifts to stay in their favor. There are switches serving different functions that need to be activated. Doors will have to be entered to locate secret rooms that may contain the stars or other valuable objects. There are Rubber Leaves that may be needed to access those hard to reach areas. Just try jumping on them. Sometimes to reach the top of a level, clouds may have to be used. Some are more solid than the others. Mushroom Seeds can be used to grow your own platform to access other platforms. You may come across machinery that activate lifts or send a jet of steam into the air. You will need a spanner to start these up. Its all up to you.</plot>

		<title_clean>Beneath a Steel Sky</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Beneath a Steel Sky is a 1994 point-and-click adventure game developed by Revolution Software Ltd. and originally published by Virgin Interactive. It was a creative collaboration between Charles Cecil, a game designer who would later create the concept for the Broken Sword franchise, and Dave Gibbons, an acclaimed comic book artist best known for illustrating the seminal superhero graphic novel Watchmen. The game stars protagonist Robert Foster, a tribal survivalist and technological prodigy who was orphaned and raised in a post-World-War-III Australian Outback, and his sarcastic robotic companion Joey. The setting and concepts of Beneath a Steel Sky address concerns about heavily-urbanized society and the threats posed by humanity's over-reliance on technology, consumer capitalism, and government surveillance. Beneath a Steel Sky's introductory sequence was packed-in as a comic book with certain editions of the game.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]As a traditional  point-and-click adventure game, Beneath a Steel Sky's gameplay is similar to LucasArts adventure games of the era, primarily consisting of navigating dialogue trees and solving inventory-based puzzles. However, there are certain sequences in which the protagonist may be killed or receive a "bad" ending, requiring players to load a saved game in order to continue. Players choose Foster's responses during conversations and may question NPCs about events related to the story and its characters, as well as Foster's own personal background. Foster's robotic pal Joey is also present throughout most of the game, providing color commentary and playing a key role in solving certain puzzles. The CD-ROM release of Beneath a Steel Sky includes full voice acting for all character dialogue.[CR]The game's world is largely non-linear and players must explore their surroundings thoroughly for key items and clues about their next destination. At one point in the game, the player gains access to an abstract cyberspace world that must be navigated to make progress.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Beneath a Steel Sky is set in a future dystopic version of Australia where players assume the role of a plucky tribal-turned-fugitive named Robert Foster. As a young boy, Robert was the sole survivor of a helicopter crash that killed his mother and left him orphaned before being discovered by a tribe of scavengers, who raised Robert as one of their own in "The Gap", an area comprised of the modern-day Australian Outback. His adoptive tribe only knew Robert by his first name, but they eventually gave him his new surname of "Foster" in reference to an empty can of Foster's Lager found near his transport's crash site. Foster learns basic survival skills under the tribe's guidance and demonstrates an incredible affinity for engineering and electronics, which he uses to construct "Joey": an AI companion stored on a small circuit board that can be swapped between robotic shells.[CR]One night, the tribe elder prophecies about a terrible evil emanating from deep beneath Union City and headed for their tribe's makeshift village. A heavily-armed helicopter suddenly arrives in The Gap and summarily attacks Foster's defenseless tribe before landing to deploy a team of soldiers from Union City. Joey's chassis is also severely damaged during the attack, forcing Foster to eject and store Joey's main circuit board for safekeeping. The soldiers begin searching specifically for Foster, claiming to want to return him to his original home. When the team's Commander Reich threatens to massacre Robert's entire village unless he is found, Foster turns himself over to Reich's custody; however, as they depart The Gap, Reich's team detonates a large explosive that obliterates the scavengers' settlement as Foster watches in horror. Restrained by Reich's guards, a grieving Foster can only bide his time and wait for an opportunity to escape and exact his vengeance.[CR]While en route to Union City central command, the helicopter's pilot loses navigational control, forcing the transport down somewhere among the cityscape's dizzying skyscrapers. After crash-landing onto an elevated city street, Foster makes a narrow escape from Reich's soldiers and finds a new robotic chassis for Joey, but Reich soon corners Foster near an industrial furnace and calls him by the unfamiliar name "Overmann". When Reich threatens Foster with a pistol, he is instantly disarmed and killed by a security turret embedded in a nearby wall.[CR]Using Reich's ID card, Foster begins investigating the reasons behind his capture and the connection to the helicopter crash that left him an orphan. He quickly finds Union City to be an urban dystopia; the sprawling metropolis is completely controlled by a centralized computer known as LINC and a legion of secret police, as well as a nightmarish justice system mired in bureaucracy. Although offering modern comforts such as advanced medical technology and automated labor, Union City's government does not recognize basic human rights for many of its citizens, with harsh distinctions between the upper and lower classes. Citizens that have been stripped of any privileges due to inappropriate behavior are known as "D-LINCs", and are subject to terrible working conditions and restricted movement inside the city with little hope for a reprieve.[CR]Foster also meets Anita, a D-LINC citizen and resistance sympathizer working in a pipe factory. She informs Foster of a plan devised by agents of nearby Hobart City to disable the rampant growth of LINC's biological components with a virus. Unfortunately, Anita is killed before she can deploy the virus; Foster later discovers a message file left for him by Anita, imploring him to complete her mission. Foster eventually obtains the virus in LINC-SPACE and, after discovering a large complex of tunnels deep beneath the city, infects LINC's systems with the virus. Joey also gains an advanced android shell inside the complex, remarking on how vulnerable he feels in his new humanoid form. However, before Foster can reach LINC's core control interface, he is confronted by a pair of deadly security androids which he barely manages to dispatch with Joey's assistance.[CR]Foster and Joey finally reach LINC's core only to discover Foster's father, Dr. Richard Overmann, physically integrated into the computer by a mass of organic tendrils. Richard explains how he became the project leader responsible for developing and constructing LINC twenty years ago, willingly fusing himself with the system in order to achieve the perfect union of man and machine. However, LINC soon grew beyond Overmann's control; it murdered the remainder of Union City's administrative council and established itself as the city's supreme ruler. Robert's mother Maria fled from Union City with her child after she realized the threat posed by LINC's absolute power. Union City security forces learned of Maria's plans to return to her original home in Hobart City and sabotaged her transport, causing the fateful crash that led to Robert's upbringing in The Gap.[CR]LINC now requires a new biologically-compatible human to interface with, as Overmann is near death; this was the reason Foster was forcibly brought to Union City at the beginning of the game, as well as why Reich was killed after threatening Foster. A regretful Overmann dies in Foster's arms, claiming that Robert was the only reason he clung to life for twenty long years. In order to save Foster from a lifetime of torment as LINC's new host, Joey uses his new humanoid robotic shell to interface with LINC instead, thus providing an ideal synthetic host for LINC and restoring Union City's basic administrative functions. As the citizens begin to relearn their city's computer system and take responsibility for their own lives again, a grateful Foster and Joey say their goodbyes before Foster returns to The Gap to seek out his next adventure.[CR]Re-releases &amp; Remake[CR]Animated introductory sequence added for Beneath a Steel Sky: Remastered[CR]Beneath a Steel Sky is currently available for download from the ScummVM homepage or from GoG.com. The game also came free with the Broken Sword trilogy box set released in the United Kingdom on 14 December 2007.[CR]Released on 23 September 2009 for the price of $2.99, Beneath a Steel Sky: Remastered is an updated port of the original game for the iPhone and iPod Touch. The game remains almost entirely the same, except for improved sound and voice acting, all new animated sequences (which are drawn by the game's original artist, Dave Gibbons), and a help system that the player can take advantage of at any time. Naturally, the game supports touch control, allowing players to slide their fingers over objects to see whether or not it is interactive.[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]One of the lockers in the security building has the name "Lovecraft" on it, in reference to early 20th century horror writer  H. P.

His other warped jungle animal friends, Barry the Bear and Graeme the Gorilla, prevent you from getting to him and rescuing your friend.[CR]Your job is to run through each level, destroying enemies that get in your way by either "clawing" them or jumping on their heads. Along the way, collect as many crystals as you can so that you can use them at the shop to buy extra lives, credits, heavenly hit points, jinormous jumps, really raj roars (which also kills enemies), and splendid speed. There are many secret areas in a level, some will take you on a different route other than the one you take when you reach the level exit. However, you must complete certain levels in order to progress further in the game, but you can return to a level that you have completed. You are given enough time to complete the level. If you run out of time before you reach the exit, you will receive no bonus. Furthermore, you do not get to access one of the three bonus levels that you can choose from if you do.</plot>

		<plot>The Dalai Llama (bad pun or what?) has organised a martial arts contest for animals of all species to prove their skills, and you are competing in it. There are a wide variety of furry creatures to take on, and finally the Dalai Llama himself. [CR]Brutal: Paws of Fury is a standard one-on-one beat 'em up across a variety of levels, with mostly outdoor terrain. You can choose of the many characters. Throughout the game, your character travels across Dalai Llama's island, fighting a series of duels before getting to the final showdown. [CR]During a duel, you can punch and kick your opponent, try to use special attacks on him/her, or use a "taunt" that restores a bit of your health. Each battle lasts a number of rounds (how many - that is determined in the options menu); once one combatant has won that number of times during the battle, he wins. If the computer-controlled player won, it's game over (but you can still use a continue to start the fight anew); if you won, you move on to the next opponent. Once you have defeated them, you can watch an ending animation, different depending on the character you have chosen. [CR]Instead of beginning a whole new game, you can fight a single duel, choosing the opponent and terrain. You can choose to fight either a computer-controlled opponent or another human player. [CR]The visuals are leant towards cutesiness, which makes a change from the gore of Mortal Kombat and the metal of Rise of the Robots.[CR]In the console versions, you start the game without special moves, but get a new one after each successful best-of-three bout. The computer versions drop this feature, though.</plot>

		<plot>Similar to Speedball 2 in many ways, this is an ultra-violent sports game. Matches last 7 minutes, and the aim is to get the ball into a goal at each end, guarded by a net-minder. The ball can be thrown or kicked, and is an oval, resulting in frequent up-and-under type kicks. [CR]The gameplay is fast and flowing, and has one rule - if you can't get the ball, get the man, and decapitate him if possible. Bonus and non-bonus items appear on the pitch, such as bombs to throw at opponents, rabbits to speed up the current player, or tortoises to slow him down. [CR]Teams consist of humans and aliens, many of which have their own unique skills. There's a lot of blood and flailing limbs, giving things a gruesomely humorous edge. There are four leagues to progress through, plus a knockout cup and single matches.</plot>

		<plot>Bubble and Squeak starts off similarly to many other platform games. Controlling a bald child, you move through a scrolling array of ledges, avoiding contact with nasties who release coins when shot. There are hidden areas to find as well.[CR]Halfway through the first of the 30 levels, you meet Squeak and the full nature of the game starts. Squeak is a blue alien, who must also be guided through the levels. As he can't jump as high as you, he must sometimes be instructed to wait while you flick a switch or otherwise solve the puzzle of how to guide him through. If you stand on top of Squeak you can be launched into an extra-high jump.[CR]Bubble Mode is an equivalent of Super Mario mode - it allows you to jump higher, run faster and shoot more lethal weaponry (bubbles in this case). It is activated by placing a coin into a Bubblegum machine, and then jumping on Squeak's back.[CR]In between the main platform levels there are side-view shoot 'em up sections taking place underwater  completing these earns bonuses.</plot>

The computer cars appear to be faster when behind you than when in front  strange.[CR]The handling is deliberately arcadey, with fast acceleration and braking as well as the chance to brake and steer at the same time.

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Cannon Fodder, and its sequel Cannon Fodder 2, are top-down squad-based shooters. They both make use of reflex-based puzzle solving with some later levels requiring a high level of dexterity and good timing to complete. The games use a darkly-humorous anti-war theme, reflected in the theme song "War Has Never Been So Much Fun" (which had lyrics in the Amiga versions of the game) and in the pre-mission screen where a queue of recruits line up in front of a hill scattered with gravestones - one for each soldier lost during the course of the game. Each soldier is uniquely-named (some after the developers), standing in contrast to the "fodder" in the game's title.[CR]The player is able to split the initial squad of soldiers into smaller groups and switch between the groups. Squads are armed with guns (primary fire) and with a limited number of grenades and rockets to destroy enemy buildings and vehicles. Missions are usually along the lines of "Destroy Enemy Buildings" or "Kill All Enemies". Some missions take place over a number of phases and different locales such as Jungle, Snow and Desert areas.[CR]War Has Never Been So Much Fun[CR]...the game's tagline and opening lyric for the game's theme tune. Released amidst controversy over the use of the poppy graphic both on the box and on the title screen, the Royal British Legion claimed that the game could mistakenly be bought by its supporters after seeing the poppy symbol. Sensible Software included the message "This game is not in any way endorsed by the Royal British Legion" on the opening screen and the UK publishers, Virgin, removed the poppy from the box art.[CR]Original System Requirements[CR]PCCPU Type: 386SXRAM Required: 4 MBHard Disk Space: 7 MBOS Version: DOS 5.0Graphics Type: VGAColor Depth: 256 Colors[CR]</plot>

		<title_clean>Castles II - Siege &amp; Conquest</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B]:[CR] Castles II: Siege and Conquest puts the player in the shoes of one of five Dukes in Bretagne in 1311. King Charles is dead without an heir and the crown is up for grabs. Through politics, resource management, military strength and castle construction the player must strategically out maneuver his AI competitors and become the true king of Bretagne!  [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]  Overview  Main Screen The majority of Gameplay takes place on a map of Bretagne. Here you have management over your three area of power- administrative, military and political. From the main screen you can dictate how you want your points in these three aspects to be spent at any one point in time. Depending upon how many points at a time are devoted to an action determines how quickly the action will be co  mpleted. Everything from Diplomacy, Spying, Attacking, Harvesting and recruiting troops is completed in this way. This allows for a great level of control in the urgency of completing tasks.   Castle Design When the player opts to visit a territory for combat or castle building the game switches to an isometric view. Castle building consists of simple wall, door and tower placement, with larger castles taking longer to build but providing better benefits for your fiefdom.    Combat Infantry and Archer Combat       Combat itself consists of the the two armies consisting of knights, infantry and archers battling on these same screens. Seeing as controls for combat are extremely simple the player has little ac  tual control over the outcome of battles besides considering when or if to sound the retreat. Sin ce the defender uses only half of his army and the attacker is allowed his full army, an aggressive playstyle is a key factor in military victories.    Plots  Plot Point Throughout the game, story points appear in the form of short clips of text (sometimes prefaced by old black and white mov i e clips) which offer branching paths. The results from these differing paths can have both beneficial and negative impacts on your quest for the throne. An example would be allowing the church to put suspected witches on trial, which could raise your standing with the church, but lower your kingdoms happiness.        Victory Victory in Castles II can be achieved by either winning the backing of the Pope, or by conquering the entire map (Pope Included) although the latter is more difficult seeing as how attacking the Pope will result in the players excommunication and the loss of all happiness in the players kingdom.  To receive the Pope's backing, the player must have sufficient lands and miltary might to validate his claim. He must then be in high enough standing with the church throughout the time the Pope considers his claim. If the players is successful in these regards, he may well be pronounced the King of Bretagne and win the game.  [CR]Sound[CR] The game posses a simple midi soundtrack that can be turned on or off. The Main Screen, The Pope, Combat and the Opening Scene all have distinct songs. The game has no sound effects.  [CR]In Game Copy Protection[CR] Castles II: Siege and Conquest, like many games of it's era, has in game copy protection to prevent its illegal distribution. It takes the form of a pseudo plot point that always revolves around the player answering a qustion with the help of the Instruction Manual, to prove that they are the rightful king.  If the player fails to answer two of these questions, the game ends and must be restarted.[CR]</plot>

		<title_clean>The Chaos Engine</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The Chaos Engine is a top-down shooter that was initially created for the Commodore Amiga. It was later ported to other platforms, including the PC and SNES.[CR]A remake of the game was released on August 29, 2013 for PC, Mac, and Linux. It is currently available for download on Steam and GOG.com.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]A screenshot from the game's introduction.[CR]A time traveler takes a journey back to Victorian England, bringing fabulous technology. However, his futuristic technology falls into the hands of the evil Baron Fortesque, who retrofits the equipment for his own personal means, thereby creating an alternate timeline. The Baron creates what comes to be known as the "Chaos Engine", a terrifying machine with the potential to alter the matter of time and space. After prolonged use, the machine absorbs the Baron, making him a part of the machine. This turns out to be the last the world would hear of the vile dictator. However, things don't end there, as the ramifications of the machine echo, as it turned humans savage and feral, creating terrifying androids and resurrecting prehistoric beings. The English countryside changes forever. Out of panic, what remains of the government hires the best soldiers of fortune in the world to shut down the Chaos Engine and save humanity.[CR]Now, six greedy guns-for-hire, motivated by money, set out to destroy what remains of Fortesque's empire. This is where the game begins.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The object of the game is to traverse levels while destroying as many enemies as possible.

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The Chaos Engine is a top-down shooter that was initially created for the Commodore Amiga. It was later ported to other platforms, including the PC and SNES.[CR]A remake of the game was released on August 29, 2013 for PC, Mac, and Linux. It is currently available for download on Steam and GOG.com.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]A screenshot from the game's introduction.[CR]A time traveler takes a journey back to Victorian England, bringing fabulous technology. However, his futuristic technology falls into the hands of the evil Baron Fortesque, who retrofits the equipment for his own personal means, thereby creating an alternate timeline. The Baron creates what comes to be known as the "Chaos Engine", a terrifying machine with the potential to alter the matter of time and space. After prolonged use, the machine absorbs the Baron, making him a part of the machine. This turns out to be the last the world would hear of the vile dictator. However, things don't end there, as the ramifications of the machine echo, as it turned humans savage and feral, creating terrifying androids and resurrecting prehistoric beings. The English countryside changes forever. Out of panic, what remains of the government hires the best soldiers of fortune in the world to shut down the Chaos Engine and save humanity.[CR]Now, six greedy guns-for-hire, motivated by money, set out to destroy what remains of Fortesque's empire. This is where the game begins.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The object of the game is to traverse levels while destroying as many enemies as possible.

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Chuck Rock is a prehistoric-themed platformer starring the eponymous caveman Chuck on a quest to rescue his wife from a jealous rival. Chuck's main form of attack is a stomach bump with a limited range, but he is also able to take advantage of rocks littering the stages to attack enemies from afar. He can also use these rocks to create platforms to higher areas he cannot reach by jumping normally. While most dinosaurs are hostile some, like the wading brachiosaurs and certain pteranodons, will assist Chuck by taking him to new areas of the stage.[CR]UK developers Core Design originally created Chuck Rock for the Atari ST and Amiga computer platforms, and it was subsequently published on many home consoles of the era by Sony Imagesoft and Virgin Interactive in Europe and the US. It is perhaps best remembered for its rock n' roll theme tune. It was followed up with a direct sequel starring Chuck's son Chuck Jr., called Chuck Rock II: Son of Chuck, and BC Racers, a spin-off cart racer game.[CR]</plot>

		<title_clean>Chuck Rock II - Son of Chuck</title_clean>
		<plot>The story in this Chuck Rock game takes up a little while after the end of the first game.  As you may remember, Chuck Rock had to rescue his girl, Ophelia from the bad dude Gary Gritter.  Well, he was successful in his efforts, and now Chuck and Ophelia are married.  Eventually, they have a son, named Junior. Chuck works in a factory, where he develops great skill at carving automobiles out of stone. A rival manufacturer becomes jealous of Chuck's abilities and kidnaps him.  Now it is up to Junior to rescue his dad![CR]The gameplay in this sequel is similar to the first game, but with some minor differences since you are playing as Junior, rather than Chuck. This is a side-scrolling platform game with occasional rock-moving puzzles thrown in. Unlike Chuck, Junior carries a club that gives his attacks further reach.</plot>

		<plot>On each of Clockwiser's levels (100 on Amiga/Amiga CD32 and 110 on DOS), you are presented with a level layout, and a target layout, with the aim being to transform the former to match the target. The levels consist of a collection of cogs, which can be rotated either clockwise or anti-clockwise to achieve this goal. There are lots of special blocks to help out, including bombs, diamond-producers and anti-gravity blocks. Each level has its own time limit, ranging from seconds to minutes - this doesn't start until you make your first move, and you can look around the level at your leisure before making a stab at it. Each level has its own password, which makes progression a little easier.</plot>

		<title_clean>D-Generation</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]D/Generation's In-Game Title[CR]Designed and created by Robert Cook, D/Generation is an isometric action-adventure puzzle game that was released by Mindscape in 1991 for the DOS, Amiga, and Atari ST platforms, and was later ported to the Amiga CD32 in 1993. Set in the year 2021, D/Generation takes place in a futuristic setting with elements of cyberpunk and dystopian fiction, and the story follows the actions of a simple courier making an urgent delivery who finds himself entangled in the illicit corporate world of bioweapon research gone horribly awry. With the courier as their player character, players must climb ten floors of the Genoq Biolabs research building in search of the scientist Jean-Paul Derrida, the recipient of the package they carry. Malfunctioning security systems and hostile organic weapons (called Neogens) will impede their progress, while traumatized Genoq employees may be able to help the courier piece together what happened at the building prior to the player's arrival.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Mere hours after receiving an urgent call in his Paris apartment, the protagonist of D/Generation, a nameless courier, arrives in Singapore via jet pack, touching down on the 80th floor of Genoq Biolabs' medical research facility with an important package for lead Genoq scientist Jean-Paul Derrida. As soon as he enters, however, the doors shut and seal themselves behind him. This, however, proves to be the least of his problems, as the receptionist soon informs him of Genoq's dire state. All lines of communication to the outside world have been severed, and furthermore the building's security systems and dangerous Neogens have run amok. Despite the perils within and the receptionist's adamant warnings, the courier chooses to proceed, perhaps believing that the item in his possession holds the key to stopping the chaos which grips Genoq.Something is amiss within Genoq Biolabs.[CR]Over the course of his journey into the building's upper reaches, the courier learns that Genoq had been steeped in the realm of illegal bioweapon development for some time, and that their medical research, which had long ago become unprofitable for them, was little more than a front for their more lucrative practice of creating and selling biological weapons called Neogens. Derrida had been brought on by the company to spearhead a project which would create the ultimate Neogen, and the fruit of his efforts, an artificial organism dubbed D/Generation, was ultimately the source of the disturbances within the building. Further complicating matters, he also learns that Genoq's corporate leaders have authorized an airstrike against the building in order to prevent details of their activities from going public.[CR]Upon reaching the top floor, the courier discovers that it was not Derrida, but rather D/Generation that sent for him, and that the package he carried with him held a neurotransmitter which it needed in order to escape the building. Trapped within a hallucinatory realm conjured by his own creation, Derrida warns the courier that D/Generation must not be allowed to leave, as it was designed to be a genetically perfect killer that could blend in anywhere. Utilizing Derrida's advice, the courier is successful in luring D/Generation into a trap where it is killed by powerful microwaves. With moments to spare, he escapes the building, preventing the airstrike and saving the remaining employees trapped within the Genoq building.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The main gameplay of D/Generation consists of traversing interconnected rooms (called "scenes" within the game), accomplishing various tasks within them in order to ascend to the next level of the tower. Each level is comprised of multiple scenes, and each scene typically presents a particular challenge which must be overcome in order to progress. The game alternates between action-based and puzzle-based gameplay, with many scenes requiring some combination of both. On the action side of things, players are constantly harassed by hostile Neogens and security systems, which frequently require quick reflexes in order to defeat. Certain doors will only unlock when an area has been cleared of dangerous entities, and furthermore it is usually not feasible to rescue survivors (who grant additional lives) until an area has been completely cleared of enemies.As the game reaches its climax, the tone becomes unexpectedly surreal.[CR]At the same time, there are cases where it is more advantageous to manipulate an enemy rather than killing it outright, which leads into the game's more cerebral leanings. Trackers can be used to kill other Trackers without firing a shot, for instance, and a Neogen that collides with a plasma barrier will permanently disable it. These are just two examples of instances in which the player is rewarded for thinking before they shoot. Most areas contain switches which can open and close doors, activate and deactivate security measures, or both, and success in many scenes comes down to manipulating these switches (as well as other devices, such as computer terminals and teleporters) in such a way as to provide safe passage for ones' self and any civilians. Timing and pattern recognition is also a crucial element throughout the game, since tougher puzzles can require that a series of deliberate actions be performed quickly.[CR]The player's Laser sidearm is a good example of how D/Generation marries action and puzzle design elements. Its first and most obvious purpose is to kill the various hostile inhabitants of the Genoq building, however it's beams can activate switches, and will also ricochet, so it is usefully in many situations in which the player might wish to activate a switch from a distance, or cannot feasibly approach one due to a particular hazard. Even in combat situations when one is faced with forces that represent an immediate danger, it often behooves the player to be mindful of other objectives within the environment, as a stray volley could, for instance, kill a survivor, thus depriving the player of an additional life as well as potential exposition.[CR]Weapons &amp; Items[CR]The arsenal of D/Generation, while not exceedingly deep, is decidedly tactical. Other than the Laser, which has unlimited uses, all items within the game are collected individually, with most being quite rare. With such limited quantities, this means that even using a single Grenade might have serious repercussions later on, like the inability to fight back against a deadly C/Generation. In general, it is a good idea to only use an item when presented the a situation which would be otherwise extremely difficult, if not impossible, to overcome.LaserLaser The first weapon found by the courier and the only one which has unlimited uses, the Laser is an invaluable tool not only for killing lesser Neogens like A/Generations and B/Generations, but also for solving various puzzles throughout the game that might require long-range switch activation.GrenadeGrenade The secondary weapon to the Laser's primary, the Grenade will be used by most players as the first line of defense against C/Generations, which are completely immune to laser weaponry. They are also able to disable Trackers, though it is rarely wise to use them in this way, since Trackers can usually be avoided or neutralized in other ways.BombBomb Use of the Bomb places a small, pulsating, red pyramidal device directly at the player's feet. After a few moments, it detonates, obliterating anything destructible in the immediate vicinity (including the player). This blast can even destroy doors, which grants a rare opportunity to access restricted zones without need of a key.ClockClock The Clock immediately slows down time for everything within the game world save the player, albeit for only a short period of time. When expecting heavy, hectic opposition, or when a particular puzzle might require an extremely fast execution of actions, the Clock can be invaluable.ShieldShield Upon use, the Shield seemingly causes the player to go out of focus. While the Shield is active, the player cannot be killed; the benefits of such a state should be readily apparent. Certain potent attacks such as Tracker grenades may destroy the Shield, but the player will not be killed as a result.Plasma BarrierPlasma Barrier The Plasma Barrier gives the player the ability to project a bouncing barrier similar to those created by Genoq's normal security system. It can be thought of as a hybrid of the Laser and the Grenade, as it has the ricocheting capability of the former combined with the destructive force of the latter.[CR]Neogens[CR]The products of Genoq's covert organic weapons research, the lethal Neogens have overrun Genoq Biolabs, permeating all levels of the building through use of ventilation shafts. In addition to the threat posed by the constructs themselves, oftentimes additional Neogens will spawn through vents, doing so indefinitely until said vents are closed by the player. Certain types seem mostly interested in the player (C/Generation), while others show no reservations in attacking survivors when given the opportunity (A/Generation).A/GenerationA/Generation Certainly one of the most numerous Neogens found throughout Genoq Biolabs, the A/Generation is a bouncing red sphere whose primary intended purpose was battlefield cleanup, though it has no qualms trying to "clean" the building's denizens, including the player. Their attack does not instantly kill, thus it is possible to break free of an A/Generation if a laser beam hits it after it begins absorbing the player.B/GenerationB/Generation The blue, cylindrical B/Generation is both faster and more deadly than its predecessor, the A/Generation. Purportedly capable of traveling in excess of seventy kilometers per hour, it subdues its target by simply crushing it from above, killing it instantaneously. While this compaction is quite handy in simplifying corpse disposal, it unfortunately means that their is no window of opportunity to survive the attack.C/GenerationC/Generation Of the more devious of Genoq's creations is the deceptive C/Generation, an organism that can mimic nearly anything, animate or inanimate. It will usually lie in wait for its victim, revealing its true form only when its hapless target is close enough to be attacked and decapitated. It is much more persistent than previously encountered Neogens, as evidenced by its propensity to follow the player between room.D/GenerationD/Generation The latest Neogen, the D/Generation prototype has no direct attacks per se, but does have the frightening ability to cause powerful, unshakable hallucinations, which render its victims powerless. It was built with certain safety precautions which would prevent it from ever leaving the Genoq facility of its own free will, but that has not stopped it from taking over the building's computer network and turning Genoq's creations against it.[CR]Security Measures[CR]Subverted by D/Generation's influence, the protective measures of Genoq Biolabs are a constant hindrance to the player. They at times can be overcome through sheer brute force, such as when using a Bomb to blow a path through a secured door, though more often than not players must simply be mindful of the threat they pose if they wish to survive their ordeal. In particular, players should always be on the lookout for keys, as they are the main means of progression on most floors.Security KeySecurity Key Littered throughout the Genoq facility are a multitude of Security Keys which grant differing levels of security clearance. There is a clear progression in most areas which leads players to find keys with successively higher clearance levels, though keys can sometimes be obtained out of order, or rendered unnecessary with a well-placed Bomb.Electrified PlateElectrified Plate / Land Mine Both Electrified Plates and Land Mines are stationary emplacements which do not present a threat unless a player attempts to walk over one. Electrified Plates will turn on and off intermittently, providing an opportunity to pass by, whereas Land Mines are constantly in an active state, and are only neutralized if triggered by something.TrackerTracker A troublesome presence throughout all ten levels of Genoq Biolabs, the Tracker is a sentry turret that will fire upon any human target directly in front of it. They come in two basic varieties: those that face a fixed position, and those that rotate in order to seek targets in all directions.Plasma BarrierPlasma Barrier The Plasma Barrier is a rebounding environmental hazard which typically bounces in a set pattern within a certain scene. They are capable of activating switches as well, so in some cases they represent active puzzle elements rather than mere passive obstructions.TeleporterTeleporter A Teleporter pad will transport a player or object instantaneously to another like pad in the immediate vicinity. Most types of player ordinance can be projected through a Teleporter, which is useful knowledge in cases when a Tracker or other danger awaits on the other side.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Dangerous Streets developed by the Italian company Micromania and published by Flair Software is a fighting game in the style of Street Fighter II.It was released for PC, Amiga 500/600, Amiga 1200 and Amiga CD32.The Amiga CD32 version is using "256 colors AGA" graphics which are similar to the PC "VGA" graphics and slightly enhanced compared to the "32 colors ECS/OCS" graphics of the Amiga floppy drive version.The game received poor ratings in several Amiga magazine reviews which critiziced the amateurish graphics, woeful sound, slightly childish-looking characters, feeble sound effects, bad animation and incomprehensible control. Only the lush and colourful background graphics with paralax scrolling were commended in some reviews.Dangerous Streets was the lead game in the bundle(called "The Dangerous Streets Pack") that the most people got their Amiga CD32 machine in. This was perhaps disadvantageous for the reputation of the CD32 due the low quality of the game. Dangerous Streets was also released in a bundle togheter with Wing Commander for Amiga CD32.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game offers three distinct game modes:Player vs. PlayerPlayer vs. CPUTournament: Here you can pick one of the 8 characters and fight through four different locations with 8 fighters and become the boss on the street.There are three game speed settings(slow, normal, fast) and three skill levels of the CPU opponents(easy, normal, hard) that can be set.Every of the 8 characters has at least three special moves. All special moves are mostly executed by the same joystick/gamepad button and exactly which move a character performs depends on the distance the character is away from his target/opponent. Also the controls for the fighters are different - push up on the joystick and one fighter will jump another will kick.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]NameDescriptionSpecial MovesKeoA German-born devoutmonk who is working as acustodian in a castle.

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Dark Seed is an adventure game developed by  Cyberdreams, Inc and published by  GAGA Communications, Inc in 1992. The game heavily uses artwork by  H.R. Giger, famously known for his design of the  Alien from the  Alien Franchise. The game features the normal world and a dark world counterpart. It was one of the first adventure games to use high-resolution graphics (640 pixels wide) to the demand of H.R. Giger.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]In the game, players control  Mike Dawson (named after the game's lead designer), an ad company manager who hates his job and pursues his goal in life to become a writer. Mike Dawson purchases a solitary mansion in a small town called Woodland Hills. Although the low cost and hush-hush transactions when purchasing the house do raise Mike's suspicion, the solitary environment and sheer beauty of the house crush common sense and he decides to buy the house. Upon reaching the house, Mike suddenly feels tired and finds a bed, proceeding to fall asleep, only to find himself in a nightmare, unable to wake up.[CR]The nightmare seems to create a version of his life and has turned it into a world of terror. An unknown source has implanted a seed of darkness in Mike's mind, and he only has three days to find a way to stop it.[CR]Ports[CR]The game was released for the  Amiga,  Amiga CD32,  PC (Dos),  Macintosh,  Sega Saturn and  PlayStation. Both the console versions, the Sega Saturn and PlayStation ports, were only released in Japan, with the Saturn version being compatible with the Sega Saturn Mouse. There was also a version developed for the Sega Mega-CD and was even promoted for American release, but publisher  Vic Tokai never released it. An unlicensed version was released for the  Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) in Chinese.[CR]Unlike most adventure games at the time, which give the player time to explore the environment, almost every action in Dark Seed has to fall within precise time limits, or the game will end up being in an unwinnable state. Due to the game frequently crashing, the player would often have to start over to win without resorting to a walk through for the game.[CR][B]Legacy:[/B][CR]Soon after the game was released, there was an urban legend that spread around that because of the intense pressure of designing Dark Seed, the game's lead designer,  Mike Dawson, had a mental breakdown. In actuality, Mike Dawson left the games industry after completing Dark Seed and moved into writing for television until the late 1990's before writing two books on programming (Beginning C Game Programming and Python Programming for the Absolute Beginner) and teaching game design and programming classes at Stanford University and UCLA.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>Doom on the 7Mhz, 16-colour, 1Mb Amiga 500 might sound unrealistic, but this is one of a handful of games that managed it, and the first full Doom-style game for the Amiga.[CR]Unusually the multiplayer game was split-screen, which didn't really work because you could sneak a look into the other window to see where your opponent was - it's not exactly full of suspense.[CR]The major compromises in getting the game onto the A500 are the graphics, which lack texture-mapping, and the trick-3D used where the characters don't rotate smoothly in 360 degrees, but jerk through a small range of viewpoints, a la Dungeon Master. Only half the screen is used for the actual motion as well, with the rest reserved for RPG-style artwork - which is obviously superfluous because the 2-player game doesn't have it. It's a throwback to the first Lotus game of all things. You can even turn the animation off.[CR]In one-player mode there are 34 levels, accessed via passwords, 3 lives, and lots of powerup weapons. If one player completes the level, both advance to the next one (like Lotus 2, funnily enough. I guess I ought to think of a similarity to Lotus 3, just to complete the set). There's also the standard Death Match mode.</plot>

		<plot>This game brings the US cartoon character Dennis the Menace's menacing treatment of poor old Mr. Wilson to the computer screen, around the time of the film also released in 1993. [CR]Dennis is a platform game across settings such as Sewers, the Park, and Mr. Wilsons house, each of which has an end-of-level bad guy. The in-level opposition follows standard attack patterns and can usually be avoided. The enemies regenerate as you move on, although you generally only progress from bottom-left to top-right anyway. [CR]Some of the holes in the ground are deadly while others lead to secret rooms. Fortunately, you are given up to 9 lives at the start, and lots of extra lives are on offer throughout the game, so these are well worth checking out. A choice between music and sound effects is offered.</plot>

		<plot>Diggers is a Lemmings-style puzzle game where you command five alien miners ( from a choice of four clans ) and various gadgets to dig for treasure. The game is divided in excavation areas. Each area has a set amount of money you must raise before moving into the next one. To do so, you must sell your collected treasure to the bank.[CR]You select your "Diggers" by clicking on them with the left mouse button, and making them do a desired action by right-clicking on the screen and choosing from a icon menu.[CR]Each clan has different characteristics and stats: for example the Grablins clan resembles fantasy dwarfs and has the fastest diggers. The Quarriors clan has the strongest miners, less likely to die in a fight with enemy diggers.</plot>

		<plot>This horizontally scrolling R-Type-influenced shoot 'em up features 5 levels to blast through, with bosses at the end of each level as well as tough mini-bosses as you go through it. There are four difficulty levels, with the easiest acting as a trainer, as you can't reach the final level or complete the game properly with it. You can customize exactly how loud the music and sound effects are relative to each other, and there lots of subtle visual effects, such as a smoke haze coming off your ship as it incurs gradual damage.[CR]The game's power-up system is worthy of note. Rather than simply picking up new weapons, or all-purpose tokens which can be traded in at the press of a button, you collect blueprints for a total of 32 different weapons as well as upgrades to the maximum amount of power your ship can unleash at a time. Once you reach a power-up bay (which are depicted as blue domes at the base of the level), you can add or remove weapons so as to maximize your attack capabilities.</plot>

		<plot>[CR]Developed by the Late Jeremy C. Smith and Peter J. M. Irvin, Elite was way ahead of it's time both in innovation (foreshadowing Metroidvania and games such as Kirby and Prince of Persia 2008 with no Fail-States and in the sheer amount of features. In the mid 80s, action adventure games usually consisted of jumping platforms pits and monsters or the puzzles and platforming of games such as Thunderstruck and Dizzy. Exile loosely shared elements of the above, along with Thrust style physics (an earlier Lunar Lander type game by Jeremy)[CR]With the ability to fly, shoot or throw objects in practically any direction and the particle effects and physics involved, the roaming creatures which could follow you across the map (compared to simple back and forth movement of many games even well into the 16 bit era) as well as your (upgradeable) space suit having 4 pockets and the ability to remember 4 teleport destinations anywhere on Phoebus, how all this fit into The BBC/Acorn Electron's 32k (or even the 512k Amiga) is amazing.[CR]The game itself involved blasting your way into the mines, away from the harsh surface winds, encountering various forms of life such as the mischievous space imps and Maggots Triax experimented on, and the helpful Fluffy, exploring and solving physics based puzzles to find items including remote control devices (RCDs) to open doors and transporters, and whistles to control rogue robots, destroying or disabling turrets and doors and, eventually making your way to Triax.[CR]Since your thrusters and weapons all used the same energy capsules, and grenades were sparse trying to avoid combat and item conservation was important, but multiple solutions to some puzzles was possible, an early example being a small ship which had 2 grenades behind an explodable door, careful use of your first found grenade could get you both, at the risk of them being caught in the blast or if you were patient, one of the RCDs could open the door later on and get you both grenades without loss. Likewise you could shoot certain turrets or robots/creatures to gain energy capsules but the loss of energy via shooting or the loss of a grenade (and the risk that the unstable energy capsules would explode before you could pocket it had to be weighed up.[CR]Another early puzzle involved finding a flask and filling it with water from a pond to put out a fire surrounding the first RCD, but carrying the empty flask out of the small alcovein which it was first found would result in the door closing before you could leave, so you had to go halfway down the tunnel, where the door in question would automatically open, "remember" a teleport slot before entering the alcove, then throw the flask out and teleport back to catch it.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>The background story of Fire &amp; Ice is quick to tell: A coyote (you) runs, throwing ice cubes, through various worlds. In the levels you must jump on platforms and kill your enemies. The enemies (for example, birds and penguins) can be shot with your ice cubes; they become frozen, so you smash them. Sometimes they leave part of a key behind after they're destroyed.  The complete key, assembled from all the pieces, opens the door to the next world. [CR]In this "jump &amp; run" you can also get some power-ups. You can find some coyote puppies; these puppies follow you, are invulnerable, and also shoot enemies. In higher regions you find some snow-flakes; enough of these and you get a great snowball for freezing more enemies on the screen.</plot>

There is time limit for each mission so hurry up.You can use guns, grenades and a knife. Slashing throats of your enemies or letting it rip with AK, it's up to you how you approach it.  Watch enemies fly when they got hit by grenades. Nice feature to able to pick up dead enemies equipment. A lot of Rambo action![CR]</plot>

		<plot>The Misadventures of Flink is a Jump'n Run set in the fantasy world of Imagica. The evil wizard Wicked Wainwright has captured the four elders and it is up to Flink, a wizard's apprentice, to set them free and defeat Wicked Wainwright.[CR]Apart from the usual platformer elements, the game has a unique feature: Flink's ability to create spells. Whenever the game is paused, Flink can combine three ingredients to create a spell. Ingredients can be collected throughout the game. They are usually carried around by a certain type of enemy or hidden in treasure chests. There are ten different spells, the "recipes" which are contained in scrolls that are given to Flink by rescued elders or found within certain levels. The spells include different attack spells (for example a demon that accompanies Flink and attacks his enemies), a shield spell, a shrink spell, a quick grow spell that lets certain plants grow so that Flink can reach new areas of a level, magic keys that open locked treasure chests and more. [CR]Casting spells uses up magic energy that can be replenished by collecting magic bottles or defeating enemies. Similar to the Sonic games, when Flink is hit, he looses all of his magic energy and has only limited time to pick it up again. If he is hit while having no magic energy, he loses a life.</plot>

		<plot>Your homeland's precious limited energy is being taken advantage of by the evil Thargoid Empire, and you and your spaceship must do something about it. There are 8 bases to enter, with the aim of using energy pods to cause the reactors to overload and thus malfunction.[CR]The game is viewed side-on, resembling the ST classic Oids quite strongly; which is to say that gravity and motion physics dictate the ship's motion strongly. The 8 levels all have plenty of enemies on offer, both wall-mountings and actual ships, as well as enhanced weapons and extra fuel and shield energy. The ship can take some damage, and repairs itself over time (for no logical reason), which is one of the few things that gives you a hope of getting anywhere early on. Losing a life causes all the enemy turrets to replenish, emphasizing the restart points and making things more maze-based and methodical.</plot>

		<title_clean>Frontier - Elite II</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Frontier: Elite II was the sequel to the seminal Elite and furthered the ambition of an open ended space trading game. The sequel brought with it markedly improved physics and a realistically modelled galaxy. To augment the open-ended nature of the game the universe was procedurally generated and real sized planets despite there being little to explore on them.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]Whilst no plot emerges during gameplay there is a plot present in the manual which sets the premise of the game. Fresh from victory in the Thargoid War during the original game humanity finds itself in crisis. With the Thargoids retreated to their own territory humanity has fallen into a cold war between the militaristic Federation and the slave owners of the Imperial Fleet. After a short war a tense ceasefire is in effect made worse by new anarchic systems taking advantage of the fear of military action by operating without law. You enter the world as always with 100 credits and a ship as the original protagonists grandchild, with no alliances to the factions and a chance to carve your own path in the world.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Changes from Elite[CR]Whilst Elite restricted you to one ship, Frontier: Elite II encouraged purchase of new ships to suit your style of play. Military vessels ranged from light fighter crafts to mammoth naval style crafts with trading crafts offering larger cargo space and mining crafts coming with specific mining lasers. Graphics are understandably improved with texture mapping and curved polygons moving the series from the simplistic wireframe style of the original.[CR] Factions[CR]The game has two primary factions which players may join. The Federation based on Earth and The Empire based in the Achenar system. Progress through both involved completing missions given at bases which allowed for promotions. The reality was that there was little gameplay difference between the two aside from the location of the base and how that would affect trade routes. The Empire was more permissive of slavery allowing for new trading opportunities whilst slavery was an arrestable offence in Federation territories. Certain ships were also designated as being independent, Federation or Empire ensuring they were out of bounds to those in an opposing faction. Finally upon joining a faction it locked off the enemies portion of space due to enemies becoming hostile upon spotting you.[CR] Control[CR]Unlike Elite, whose controls were arcade style, Frontier opted for a rigid Newtonian physics model making flight control and dogfights highly difficult. In moving momentum had to be considered as did gravitational pull. Whilst difficult this did offer emergent gameplay such as using planets to slingshot great distances (not programmed in but emergent through the physics model). This put control closer to a flight simulator than the arcades. Making gameplay approachable despite these difficulties was done in two ways. Firstly long distance travel is done by use of the hyperdrive which makes long distance travel extremely quick and day to day such as docking and navigating to positions for using the hyperdrive can be handed to the autopilot.[CR] Earning Credits[CR]The game starts you with one hundred credits and an Eagle Long Range Fighter, setting you loose on an open ended universe. As with Elite the game concerns engaging in legal or illegal trading to earn credits and advance in whatever fashion the player desires. The game revolves around finding the most profitable trading routes and running them to earn maximum credits. Trading can be done by simply purchasing from ports or by mining asteroids however the cost of a mining vessel does restrict that aspect of the game until later levels. Certain items are deemed illegal in various ports and planets (such as narcotics) with the reward of lucrative black market trading being offset by the risk of police intervention. Again though black market trading involves a certain amount of investment (life support for cargo bay to transport slaves for example) which limits it to a more advanced player. Beyond trading bounty hunting and military missions can both be highly profitable but come with inherent risks. Bounty hunting taking you into anarchic systems and to highly dangerous ships with military missions raising your rank by allying you to a faction and to a set of solar systems whilst making you unwelcome in others.[CR] Bugs[CR]Rushed for release in the UK for Christmas 1993 the game was filled with bugs. These ranged from inconsistencies between the booklet and the game (with regards to ship details) to incorrect prices paid for gems in the Cemiess system making trading there almost game-breakingly lucrative. The only bug which required a patch however was the "mining glitch" where attempting to leave equipment in a system ended in a crash. The most famous of bugs however is the wormhole bug which exploited a maths overflow in calculating hyperspace distances. In essence is the jump distance was exactly 655.36 light years the game would allow a jump regardless of ship capabilities. This was removed for the versions released after 1993 however it has made the freeware UK version the most popular. Moving away from bugs large portions of the game seemingly suffers from it's ambition by showing a lack of polish. Ships such as "The Lion" cannot handle having turrets installed as it simply fires into it's own wing and missiles being largely unable to damage crafts. Whilst minor there are instances of this lack of polish impacting strongly on gameplay as can be seen by the police AI being astonishingly poor resulting in police chases being impossible due to the police crafts crashing into each other almost instantly.[CR] Ships[CR]Interplanetary Shuttle[CR]Lifter[CR]Osprey[CR]Falcon[CR]Hawk Airfighter[CR]Kestrel Airfighter[CR]Eagle Mk. I[CR]Eagle Mk. II[CR]Eagle Mk. III[CR]Sidewinder[CR]Krait[CR]Gecko[CR]Adder[CR]Viper[CR]Cobra Mk. I[CR]Moray Starboat[CR]Cobra Mk.

A proposed modern iteration named Elite 4 was planned and down as being under development on the Frontier Developments website but was never shown. On November 5th 2012 Frontier Development launched a Kickstarter to help fund development of Elite: Dangerous, a sequel in the genre and spirit of the original games for release in 2014. The project achieved it's goal and raised over &#163;1.5 million in funding.[CR]</plot>

		<title_clean>Global Effect</title_clean>
		<plot>Essentially similar to The Settlers AKA Serf City, Global Effect involves building up a sound local economy before going out to attack other nations and rule the world. Cities must contain housing, food sources and power supplies, which is where it gets complicated. You can choose the environmental settings of the game, in a similar way to Civilization - an icy world or a post-apocalyptic one make things much tougher.[CR]Environmental factors play the biggest part in this game, as you have to use efficient power sources if possible. You only get a certain level of power at the start of the game, and have to build enough 'green' things to increase it further - trees are the most effective.[CR]Once you have a fully functional city capable of supporting military units of any quality, these can be directed off into battle by giving them pre-planned flight paths which can be over-ridden if need be.[CR]Two-player games can be played via null-modem cables, even across different systems.</plot>

		<plot>As the title implies, Gloom is an attempt at recreating Doom for the Amiga. In 1995 this was a big target for programmers, as it was felt that the Amiga 1200 was capable of bringing the first person 3D action to life.[CR]Gloom was written by New Zealand's respected Acid Software team, and published by Guildhall who supported the Amiga heavily in its later years. The emphasis was placed on action, rather than collecting keys and negotiating through maps.</plot>

		<plot>Resembling Starfox in many ways, Guardian is a fast and furious shoot 'em up. You skim over the surface of a planet, shooting enemies down as quickly as you can, with the hope of protecting as may of the installations as possible - the more you save, the quicker you get extra lives.[CR]Plenty of power-ups are offered during the game, including enhanced weaponry and shields. The game is viewed in full 3D, and the camera angle can be adjusted. CD32 controllers are recommended, although keyboard and mouse are also available.</plot>

		<plot>The Earth is flooded, humanity is on the brink of extinction. The distress signal from planet Earth reaches a far away underwater planet and the inhabitants decide to rescue us. They send a spaceship with Captain Gulp and the Aquarons towards our star system and it's the player's job to see that they are successful![CR]In Gulp!, the player controls a number of fish swimming in water filled tubes. The game takes its inspiration from Lemmings - like in the aforementioned game, you have to pick specific "jobs" for some of your fish to solve the puzzles in each level. A lot of the gameplay revolves around flipping switches in the correct order to alter the water flow within the pipes. In some of the later levels, the fish crew has to be split in multiple groups to finish the stages. The goal of each level is to get the fish to the exit, and all this has to be done within a time limit.</plot>

		<plot>[CR]Gunship 2000 puts players in the role of a    helicopter   pilot for the     US Army. Players can choose to fly single, one-off missions or take part in an ongoing campaign in a theater of their choice, either in Eastern  Europe in a hypothetical conflict between NATO and the Soviet Union, or in the Persian Gulf to take part in the historical Operation Desert Storm.  Players start their career as a warrant officer, flying a lone helicopter in missions against either fixed targets or vehicles, usually tanks, on the move. Missions feature a primary objective, a secondary objective, a home base, and occasionally a FARP (forward arming refuel point,) where they could land and stock up on ammo and fuel. Most missions were of a search and destroy nature, but occasionally pick up and deliver missions were ordered. If players did well enough on their first few missions, they were offered the chance to be promoted to the commissioned rank of 2nd lieutenant.   Once this happened, players were accompanied in missions by a flight of wingmen. The flight consisted of six helos, total. One heavy flight, which contained four helos, and an additional light flight of two. Players could select aircraft and loadout for their flight, as well as issue orders to them in-flight. However, they executed their orders with varying degrees of competence. Often, they would attack low-priority targets with their best weapons, or, unload a barrage of high-powered weapons upon a target which the player already attacked with a missile in-flight. Even so, swooping in with a mix of six well-armed helos was more effective than going it alone.  The game featured adjustable realism settings. They also had to deal with environmental effects such as ground cover, which is ideal for helicopters to attack from, wind effects, and temperature. Lower air temperatures allow aircraft to carry heavier loads, in general, so players flying campaigns in Europe could typically load heavier ordnance than players trying to fight it out in the desert. Further, European maps typically had more terrain features to hide behind, making the European campaigns generally easier than desert ones.  Players could chose from a wide array of helicopters and armaments, some of which were in use at the time, and some of which were under development. The list includes:  AH-1T Cobra AH-64A Apache  AH-64D Apache Longbow (in development at the time)OH-58 Kiowa MD 500 Defender UH-60 Blackhawk RAH-66 Comanche Warrior (in development at the time, later canceled)RAH-66 Comanche Scout (in development at the time, later canceled)[CR]</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Created by British developer Archer Maclean, International Karate + built on the formula established by International Karate, its prequel. The numerous improvements included the adding of a third fighter on screen. Only two of these three could be controlled and each fighter only differed in the colour of their overalls. The game was fought over rounds, presented in a 2D fighting arena with a Japanese feel.[CR]Characters are controlled with a keyboard or joystick, through a combination of direction and a single button press in a manner similar to modern day equivalents. The original soundtrack was composed by Rob Hubbard.[CR]Whilst a fondly remembered fighting game per se, it is perhaps best known for the british humour laced through-out. Examples included in the Amiga and Atari ST versions were pressing "T" to make all the trousers of the fighters fall down. The typing of other key words would cause a sunset or a bird to fly by. Typing a swear word of common parlance would illicit an on screen warning to desist, persisting to type curse words would cause the game to reset to its title screen.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]James Pond 2: Codename RoboCod is the second game in the James Pond series, which is also known as Super James Pond. It features the piscine special agent in a new mission at the North Pole. Unlike its free-form predecessor, James Pond 2 is a far more traditional side-scrolling platformer.[CR]The game was originally released on the Commodore Amiga, Atari ST and the Sega Genesis in 1991. They were followed with ports to the Amiga CD32, C64, Game Boy, Game Gear, Sega Master System and the Super Nintendo. It has recently received additional graphically enhanced ports for the Nintendo DS, PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Network.[CR]There have been multiple publishers for the game. The SNES port alone has three: Victor Interactive Software published the game in Japan, American Softworks in the US and Ocean Software in Europe. EA, US Gold and others have published the game on other systems.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]James Pond 2: Codename Robocod is a side-scrolling platformer which is very similar in feel and gameplay to the early Super Mario Bros. games. The player takes on the role of James Pond; a walking fish with body armor who must free all of the Penguins and Toys that the evil Dr. Maybe has captured. In addition to the more traditional elements of platforming, the player has the ability to extend James' body vertically in order to reach platforms and items. He also has access to a number of vehicles throughout the game, such as cars, biplanes and a flying bath.[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]The UK version of the game contains one of the earliest known forms of in-game product placements with the Penguins in the game advertising the "Penguin" chocolate bar by McVities.The SNES version of the game was called Super James Pond in North America, whereas in other regions it was called Super James Pond 2.The Playstation, Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS versions of the game are re-makes rather than ports, with changes to music, level design and art, they are generally considered to be inferior games.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]Electronic Gaming Monthly's Mike Weigand revealed little in his short review of the SNES version of the game other than his review score of 5 out of ten. He wrote, "...James's ability to make himself tall is quite interesting, but that is really the only special thing about him". He suggested that fans of the franchise may prefer Aquatic Games.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]James Pond 3: Operation Starfish (sometimes stylized as "James Pond 3: Operation Starfi5h") is the third game in the James Pond series of platformers featuring the piscine super agent. Dr. Maybe has escaped and hatches a new plot involving devaluing the world's cheese industry by stealing the moon's cheese. James Pond has lost the telescopic powers of his robot body from James Pond 2: Codename: RoboCod, but now has access to a number of different power-ups as well as the superior jumping skills of his companion Finnius Frog. The game is modeled on Super Mario World, with secret branching paths that can be found in certain stages.[CR]The game was released on the Sega Genesis, Super Nintendo, Game Gear and the Commodore Amiga. It would be the last James Pond game to be developed until 2011 with the iOS game James Pond in the Deathly Shallows.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>MIS, the FBI, NASA, the KGB, MOSSAD and even top secret agents from the North Beckinsdale Pigeon Fancier's Association swung into action immediately. They were swiftly halted in their tracks when they received a top level order warning of a massive campaign of bribery of government officials in all countries. It appeared that any overt attempt to destroy SPUDD would result in the downfall of most of the world's governments. SPUDD-controlled leaders would soon rise to replace them.[CR]As the situation has worsened by the day, and SPUDD's forces have grown from strength to strength, the various agencies have now put together an underground task force which they hope will combat the growing threat. This elite task force comprises one agent (yourself - nice of you to volunteer by the way), a highly trained mechanic called Harry, and a field support officer to assign missions. The plan is that you will "borrow" aircraft from local air forces and carry out secret strike missions on SPUDD forces while they are still small enough to have to stay hidden. Hopefully, by damaging their supply lines, factories and control centres, you should be able to ruin their plans of world domination. However, if you wreck too many expensive aircraft, your sponsors will not be able to cover for you, resulting in your sent back to the secret agent's Basic Training School.[CR]In Jetstrike you must stop the devious SPUDD forces by attacking them with your "borrowed" aircraft. Your Commanding Officer will give you a mission objective which you have to try to achieve without being shot down, blown up or crashing into mountains.[CR]Jetstrike is an 2D side-scrolling action game like Brderbunds Wings of Fury. The great difference between these games is, in Jetstike its possible to use 32 aircraft and 6 helicopters in several combat-missions or to be a part of the Aerolympics.</plot>

		<plot>Released to coincide with the 1992 European Football Championships, and licensed around Jamaican-born Liverpool star John Barnes.[CR]The gameplay is superficially similar to Krisalis' previous Manchester United Europe title. The action is viewed from side-on and overhead, giving a slight forced perspective. [CR]Unlike Manchester United Europe, only a small amount of the pitch is visible at a time, which makes the game faster, but amkes long-range passing harder (perhaps to make the game more like Barnes' own style)[CR]Control is precise and the ball sticks to your feet to some extent. The only teams included are the 8 qualifiers for the 1992 European Championships, and that is the only tournament. You can play either as the nearest player to the ball, ro always be Barnes.</plot>

Players command a variety of aircraft and ground units in order to stop Ibn Kilbaba, the son of General Kilbaba from Desert Strike and Carlos Ortega, the drug lord, who threaten the United States with nuclear weapons.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game plays from an isometric perspective and is broken down into specific missions that need to be accomplished on each level. These range from attacking certain locations to defending objectives. Should any of the objectives result in a failure, the player must restart the level from the beginning. Before each level, players choose a co-pilot to help them, which gives the players semi-automatic to automatic fire on the machine guns. During the missions, fuel, ammunition, and armor all  factor into the gameplay. [CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Ibn Kilbaba, the son of General Kilbaba from Desert Strike, plots his revenge against the United States by allying himself with Carlos Ortega, the drug lord, and announces his domiance by dropping a nuke on an island somewhere in the Pacific. STRIKE quickly send their top agent to secure the President and the surrounding D.C. area against terrorist attack. After securing the President, STRIKE moves to nullify Kilbaba's nuclear capability and control of specific regions. Being pushed back to the mountains, Kilbaba and the Drug Lord put up a strong resistance in their fortress, but are captured and taken back to the United States. However, both are able to escape following an attack on the Capitol. In the end, Kilbaba's escape in a gasoline truck is cut short and the Drug Lord is presumed dead after attempting to flee in a bus. With both leaders out of commission and a nuclear crisis averted in Washington D.C., the world is once again safe from fanatical leaders.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>Kang Fu is a standard, side-scrolling platformer. The player takes control over Klont, a kangaroo, who has travel to numerous levels while saving baby kangaroos and killing a boss at the end. Of course there are many enemies which decrease Klont's life bar when they manage to hit him. He can dispose of them by jumping on their heads or by using weapons which can be found during the levels: boomerangs, eggs, machine gun, bombs and boxing gloves. The player can circle through all collected weapons and most of them disappear after finishing a level. Other collectibles are the already mentioned babies and diamonds which reward extra lives and bombs when enough of them were gathered. Sometimes a hidden key has to be found in order to open a closed door. There are two easier difficulty levels which only give access to the first few levels. The graphics style is a mix between drawn graphics and digitized images.</plot>

		<title_clean>Kid Chaos</title_clean>
		<plot>Kid Chaos is transported from the stone age into an unknown world by evil scientists from the future. Now he must fight his way through artificial environments such as the Secret Garden, Toxic Wasteland, Toy Factory, Techno Fortress, and the Ruined City to reach the time machine that can transport him back home.[CR]Kid does this by running through the level, destroying all wildlife and several destruction targets, then leave the level by the exit door, which remain closed until Kid has destroyed all destruction targets. He destroys by swinging his club in the air and hitting them. He can also whiz if he's running fast, which enable him to discover hidden passages through walls that usually contain apples and power-ups. These are also found if Kid manages to jump really high in the air and lands on a platform that usually lead to secret passages.[CR]There are five levels and four sections to complete in all of them (a total of twenty levels) and Kid start each level with three lives. During the level, if he loses health just by touching wildlife, or if the time expires, he is warped out of the level, loses a life, and has to restart the level at the checkpoints he passes through. His health can be restored either by waiting for the health meter to reach 99 (the boring way) or collecting apples (the smart way), but as Kid progresses further throughout the game, these apples become rare as well as his destruction targets. [CR]Once he leaves a level, Kid is given a statistics screen, telling him the percentage of destruction he has caused, how much wildlife he has killed, how many apples he collected, and other extras. These "extras" probably include how much more of his destruction targets he broke beyond the requirement.[CR]As mentioned earlier, if Kid jumps really high to reach a platform, he can get power-ups, giving him such wonderful things like extra lives, extra time, or extra health. He can also collect a life token. If he manages to find three life tokens within the same section, then he is awarded an extra life as well.[CR]Every fourth level, Kid will be faced with a challenge, and the object of these is usually to kill something, but there's always a catch for these challenges. For example, in Toy Factory, he has to shoot teddy bears at least ten times to blow them up, while avoiding shooting at ducks; and in Techno Fortress, he's presented with a game similar to Space Invaders, but only this time, there are no barriers. [CR]Kid Chaos starts off easily, but the further he progresses in the game, the higher the damage factor. Early in the game, he is allowed to hit so much wildlife before he loses a life, but as he progresses through each level, he can't afford to be hit not even once. Some levels in the game are quite tricky. Some levels require him to race through the level under a very strict time limit, while others contain a huge destruction target and he can't afford to miss any of these targets.[CR]The game uses a password system, that allows you to resume at the start of each level. In terms of the gameplay, one of the cheats say it all.</plot>

		<title_clean>Last Ninja 3</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR] This is the last game of the Last Ninja series. The final combat between Armakuni, the Last Ninja, and his arch rival, the evil shogun Kunitoki, is drawing near. Although The Last Ninja destroyed all the reminders of the evil shogun's existence both at Lin Fen and in modern day New York, he is still troubled by the fact that the shogun had slipped through his grasp both times. He knows that it is just a question of time before he once again will have to fight the shogun and his henchmen again, the only question is where and when. Then, suddenly, the ninjitsu spirits summon upon him once again, and take him to an inaccessible Buddhist temple deep into Tibet. These temples are the very heart of Ninjitsu power, this is where the Ninja brotherhood draws its strength from. The shogun is trying to corrupt these temples, in order to destroy the powers twice denied him by Armakuni. In this beautiful and remote setting, the ninja both has to fence off the shogun's fierce and vigilant guards, and complete several puzzles that blocks his way on to the final stand-off between himself and his old adversary. The puzzles include picking up and combining objects, and also manipulating his surroundings so that he may complete his task. All this while the shogun waits for the time to come that he may complete his evil plans. Gameplay consists of the main character walking from screen toscreen collecting this, and using that, solving puzzles and kicking plentyof arses along the way. The levels are relatively simple layouts of about 20 screens viewed in a 3D isometric perspective, some levels aredeliberately complex mazes however. The rather clever control systemallows you to move the central character around his pseudo 3D universevery realistically and subtly.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>An alien race watched the wars on Earth as television shows. After a period of peace threatens the ratings, two alien scientists go back in time on various continents of the planet and start to deploy modern weaponry on them. When they return to the present, Earth is engulfed in chaos. A British scientist discovers the conspiracy and using his new invention, the soul transfer machine, sends a boy called Billy to be incarnated on a native of the different time periods.[CR]Legends is an action-adventure with Zelda-inspired gameplay. The player controls a character pertinent to the time period (an American Indian from 1400 A.D. - America, a knight from medieval England, a Chinese warrior from Imperial China, an Egyptian acolyte from ancient Egypt, and Billy in the alien spaceship). [CR]These characters collect objects and coins to buy items, weapons to fight the enemies and hearts to increase the health bar (located on the top-left of the screen). Pressing 1, 2 and 3 switches between the available weapons. Other characters provide clues and level objectives. Each epoch has bosses to be defeated and mini-games (for example, on the Chinese level there's a race on the Great Wall). After solving each time period, the game displays a password that can be entered at the start on the main screen. There is no form of saving progress while playing the main game.</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The first level - 'Just Dig'.Originally an Amiga exclusive, developed by DMA design (later becoming Rockstar North) was met with an exceptional reception and was quickly ported to many different platforms. A puzzle game that requires players to direct a group of green haired, blue-shirted, lemmings from point A to point B. The game is based on the myth that lemmings migrate in large groups and follow a single leader, who would often lead them off a cliff to their demise. In the game, lemmings constantly march in one direction unless they run into an obstacle, at which point they turn around and walk the other way. Being fearless and unaware of their own mortality, the lemmings will blindly run into fire, jump off cliffs, become crushed and fall victim to numerous other pitfalls.The player must command the lemmings to do certain tasks in order to complete each stage and get a certain percentage of lemmings to safety. These actions include digging, using a pick axe to dig diagonally, using their arms (windmill style) to punch horizontally through terrain and building staircases to traverse large gaps.[CR][B]Levels:[/B][CR]All levels in Lemmings consist of at least one entrance, and at least one exit. The aim in each level is to safely get an allocated amount of lemmings towards an exit. Obstacles; such as water, deadly traps and great heights will hinder the lemmings' progress.There are 120 levels in total, split into four difficulty ratings - Fun, Tricky, Taxing, and Mayhem.[CR][B]Skills:[/B][CR]There are eight different skills available for the lemmings to carry out. Each level has a different selection and amount of abilities available. Different situations require the use of different skills.Several lemmings using the 'floater' skill.The skills are:Climbers - Climbers will climb a vertical surface until they reach the end of the surface.Diggers - Diggers will dig downward vertically through any soft surface until they reach empty space impenetrable surface.Miners - These will dig diagonally downward through any soft surface until they reach empty space impenetrable surface.Bashers - Will dig horizontally through a wall made of any soft surface until they reach empty space impenetrable surface.Builders - Will build a 12 step stairway diagonally upwards.Blockers - Will stop walking and block the advances of other lemmings, causing them to reverse their course.Bombers - A countdown will appear above their head, counting from 5 to 0. Upon reaching zero, they will explode.Floaters - Using an umbrella, these lemmings will float down a long drop.Lemmings being nuked.Three other types of commands can be used by the player, these are:Drop rate - The player may increase and decrease the rate in which lemmings fall from the entrance.Pause - The player may temporarily halt the game, this mode can be used to select skills without using any extra time on the clock.Nuke - If the player has reached a dead end and cannot finish the level then this button can be clicked in order to blow up every lemming on the screen.[CR]</plot>

The playing is either from the back view as you go wandering the tunnels and castles, or like an ordinary 2D adventure where you have to fight, jump or squash something.</plot>

		<title_clean>The Lost Vikings</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The main characters are three Vikings, Erik the Swift, Baleog the Fierce, and Olaf the Stout. The goal is to guide all Vikings safely through each level. The game's originality is due to the fact that the player controls three different characters (although only one at any given time), and must make use of their individual abilities and their combination to solve puzzles and progress. The game featured infinite opportunities of retries in case the player were to lose one of the Vikings. Much of the game's appeal came from the humorous inter-level dialogues of the characters.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]The three vikings[CR]This game sets players with the task of completing each level by using 3 different characters. This requires the use of each Viking's abilities as well as getting them all to the area's exit point alive.[CR]Erik the Swift - As his name states, he is very agile being the only one of the three that can run or jump. That fact alone makes him invaluable in a platformer but, additionally, if he gets a large enough start he can do a speeding charge helmet first into things. It will damage enemies but it's main use is in destroying breakable walls.[CR]Baleog the Fierce - He lives up to the name by being the main fighter. He has a sword to strike down enemies and a longbow to kill from afar. His bow serves the dual purpose of being able to activate buttons from a distance. In certain stages, Baelog is able to set his arrows on fire to solve various puzzles.[CR]Olaf the Stout - He carries on him a large round shield as tall as himself which lets him stop almost any attack. This can halt approaching enemies, or protect the vikings from any oncoming projectiles. His shield can also be lifted above his head. Not only will this work as a platform allowing Erik a higher jump from, but it manages to serve as a hang glider for Olaf, allowing his stout frame to float through the air.[CR]Areas[CR]The game consists of 36 stages, divided into several chapters, each with a different theme.Stages 1-4: The vikings attempt to escape from the alien shipStages 5-11: The vikings are in prehistoric Earth, fighting dinosaurs and cave-menStages 12-17: The vikings are in ancient Egypt, and now have to contend enemies which are able to leap over Olaf's shield, as well as poisonous insects.Stages 18-25: The vikings are in a modern factory, and must navigate more automated environmental hazards.Stages 26-33: The vikings are in "Wonderland", and area that operates off of cartoon physics.Stages 34-36: The vikings are back on the alien ship and must now fight Tomator, the leader of the aliens.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]When released, Electronic Gaming Monthly issued the scores of 6,8,8,8, adding, "Another excellent job from Interplay! Once you play, you're greeted with excellent soundtracks and plenty of bass! The puzzles get very difficult but are not frustrating. The Viking characters have their own personalities complete with comical antics. This game is a definite must-get".[CR]Starcraft II Tribute[CR]The Hyperion's bar in Starcraft II has an arcade machine named "The Lost Viking". It's a shoot'em up where players take control of a lost spaceship (named 'Viking' after the SC2 Terran unit) trying to get home.[CR]</plot>

Other gameplay features include diving headers, variable pitch conditions, penalty shoot-outs and accurate deflections. 2500 players featured in the game all had a range of varied ability statistics, as well as different skin tones.[CR]As well as individual matches and custom-created tournaments (which have much the same range of features as Sensible Soccer, plus full calculation of injury and suspension severities, including disciplinary points and differing injury lengths), you can play out a full season of matches for any club in Englands top 5 divisions  all domestic league and cup matches are included, with promotions and relegations taking place after each season.

		<plot>One of the most console-style platformers ever seen on the Amiga, Marvin has approximately 60 levels to battle through. There are stars to collect, extra lives on offer, slides, tubes, ladders, caterpillars to move across, and bonus fruit to collect.[CR]The levels are inhabited by typical enemies, some of which are killed by jumping on their heads, while others must be kicked or shot (once you collect a weapon).[CR]Many of the annoyances which plague platform games, such as blind jumps and spikes appearing at random, are deliberately absent from this. The graphics are intentionally cute, using the AGA chip-set for 256 colours.</plot>

Besides the gold coins, each arena is filled with monsters, hazards, and weapons which you must look out for. Use the map to help you locate these.[CR]As you progress through the arenas, there are new challenges which you must face such as multi-level arenas, locked doors and passages, slippery surfaces, and much more. Also scattered throughout the arenas is the letter "B", which when collected will award you a letter that make up the word CREDIT. When you have formed the word, you will be awarded an extra credit. Besides the standard arenas, there are also speed arenas, which are more difficult than the others. The object of these arenas is to get past more obstacles and gather as many coins as you can before the time expires.[CR]In each arena, you will receive messages from time to time, as well as a password, which you can enter to resume that game from that arena.</plot>

		<plot>Young Morris Rolph has been trapped in limbo due to a malfunction on Dr Krankenpot's new teleport machine (how come characters with German-sounding names in computer games and films are always evil or stupid? Even Darth Vader sounds German.). Now he's been split into his 4 component parts, represented by liquid, gas, a hard ball and a bouncy ball, and he must get through 24 levels (36 on the special A1200 version - mirroring the game's plot-line of improved technology causing more problems for Morris) to retrieve the parts of the machine so it can be rebuilt to bring him back to life.[CR]The gameplay is vaguely influenced by Lemmings, as the levels are populated by lots of points which can't be crossed in all forms - walls, fires, gaps, thornbushes and suchlike. You get a set number of transformations on each level, although extra ones can be picked up at times, and there are heaters and freezers dotted around which cause transformations in some states. All this is done against a time limit. Like Lemmings 2, you can take on the next level in each of the worlds at any time, so you have to be stuck 4 times before you can't progress.</plot>

		<plot>In this platform game, you are a mere mortal who has been called by the Gods to defeat several mythological creatures that have been turned bad by the evil Dameron.[CR]Myth: History in the Making is a platform game with a lot of fighting. The levels of this game deal with different mythologies, from ancient Greece to the Vikings, over to Valhalla (where none other than the hammer-wielding Thor awaits you), and more.[CR]Apart from jumping from platform to platform, you'll also fight the enemies and bosses in your path with a variety of weapons - in the beginning you have only fists to defend yourself, but later you'll find more powerful weapons, such as swords and axes. There are many various types of enemies, different on every level. Typically, enemies keep appearing and coming at you from all sides, no matter how many of them you kill - so you have to keep moving. [CR]Some obstacles in the game require not only brute force, but also a bit of thinking and puzzle-solving (and guesswork) to get past.</plot>

		<plot>The Naughty Ones come under your control in this old-fashioned platform game. Each screen is separate from the others, and involves trying to collect a key and then progress through the exit. Enemies are best dealt with by shooting one of your longer-range weapons towards them and waiting for it to hit them - this will release at least one coin, for points. Improved weapons can be collected, each of which functions for a limited number of shots.  Bonus items are often located in the more precarious parts of the level, leading you to choose whether to risk losing a life, and going back to the start of the screen (although previously killed creatures remain dead when you lose a life)</plot>

		<plot>Arc Developments created a 3D game world called Reality3 for this simulation, licensed around one of Britain's top players. There are two courses, plus a hidden 9-hole course on Mars with reduced gravity, with match play and stroke play options against one of 8 varied-difficulty computer players.[CR]The control system is quite unusual, as the strength of the shot is chosen before you start the swing, but you have to click within a range to activate the shot, and this range is narrower if your shot is intended to be more powerful. An extra click can be made to add wrist snap, which increases the shot's power. The wind calculation is more complicated than most games of the era, and the rough is harder to play out of than usual, as you can't make slight stance adjustments easily.</plot>

The back story revolves around a giant dreadnought attacking an unnamed planet. The player takes the role of the chosen hero and boards their flying saucer to eliminate the aliens called Sirians.[CR]The game is a horizontal scrolling shooter. After a wave of enemies is destroyed, they release a power-up token. Collecting it will advance the weapon select gauge by one step, similar to Gradius. In this way, the weapon systems of the player's ship can be upgraded. If the player hits an enemy or a bullet, their energy bar is reduced. At the end of each level, a guardian awaits that needs to be destroyed in order to advance further in the game.</plot>

		<plot>European Tour is best thought of as a remake of the original game, rather than a sequel as such. It features 5 courses from across Europe, and 60 top European pros, rather than the US-leaned lineup of the original. The graphics are much more detailed and colorful, as you'd expect considering the intervening years of advances in programming skill.[CR]The control system is the standard three-click method used in most golf games, but you can now define intended draw/fade levels in advance of playing the shot, so that a perfect aim leads to a measured effect, and an imperfect one exaggerating the effect.[CR]As well as the Stroke Play games of the original (where you count the total score across the whole round of 18 holes, and compare this to your opponent), there are also Match Play (where the aim is to win as many individual holes as possible) and Skins (the same, but with money) modes as well.</plot>

These contain ramps, bonus areas and combo sequences to set up. All the artwork were produced in true 256 colors from the ground up for AGA Amigas and the PC, rather than originating in 32 colors on older Amigas.[CR]New to this version is multiball: Pinball Illusions supports up to six balls simultaneously, in which case it switches to high resolution mode. CD versions use CD audio for music.</plot>

		<plot>The central theme of the pinball game Pinball Prelude is time. The first table is set in the past and features a dinosaur setting, with table elements being not easily recognizable as such since they blend into the environment. The second table is set in the present and at the same time the most conventional of the three design-wise. The third table plays in the future and contains five flippers in total.[CR]Some of the features include a hi-res mode for multi-ball, vertical and horizontal scrolling of the playfield and a rubber ball, which behaves much differently than the standard steel sphere.</plot>

		<title_clean>Premiere</title_clean>
		<plot>A very colorful side scrolling platform game. You play Glutch Gable in a quest to find his missing movie reels. As it turns out, the six film reels have been strategically placed in six different film sets around the studios. Each set has a different theme, from cowboy western to sci-fi adventure. Clutch must take on all manner of baddies who are out to prevent him finding the reels.[CR]  The nasties in the game are relevant to each set; for example in the western you have cowboys and indians, tumbleweed and circling vultures, while in the black-and-white setting you'll find mummies, moving hieroglyphics and slinky black cats. The music also fits the bill perfectly, with some natty tunes belting out of your Amiga monitor which really add to the atmosphere of the game.[CR] Passing through one of the doors in each set will take you 'backstage', away from the film scenario and into a world of scaffolding, props and film cameras. Some of the nasties can be found here as well (rehearsing, I suppose) and they're just as deadly as their Equity card carrying colleagues. Help is at hand in the form of a variety of weapons which may be picked up along the way and can be used to vanquish any foe you come across. From the six-shooter of the westworld to the magic spells of fantasyland, they are always there in great abundance.[CR] After each level a bonus game must be completed before the film reel can be retrieved. This takes the form of a short scene from a film which must be acted out by Clutch himself. For example, at the end of the black-and-white film level our hero must ride a truck along a railway line, collecting ammo and dodging various obstacles, while the sci-fi scene ends with a scrolling shoot-em-up. This all adds to the fun of the game, providing a much-needed break from the platform sections.  [CR]</plot>

		<title_clean>Rise of the Robots</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]At the time of the game's release, people were very impressed by the advanced 3D visuals.Rise of the Robots is a fighting game developed by Mirage Technologies and released on a wide variety of platforms including the SNES and Sega Master System. The game was even released in an arcade cabinet.All of the featured characters are robots, with the exception of the main player character featured on the front cover, who is in fact a cyborg; whenever he is defeated in battle, a brief cutscene is shown of his lifeless body, and as the armour around his face is destroyed, we see a human eye underneath. This style was influenced by several popular movies at the time like Blade Runner and The Terminator.The game had a lot of hype pre-release due to the highly detailed visuals and soundtrack by rock guitarist Brian May (of Queen fame). It was intended to take the gameplay of similar fighting games like Street Fighter II, and mesh it with highly advanced visuals to create a new, more technologically advanced era of fighting games. However, upon release the game failed to live up to expectations; the graphics, visuals, and soundtrack were all well made, but the controls handled terribly and movement felt sluggish. The game was almost universally panned by critics and quickly became known for it's poor controls, repetitive gameplay, and lack of any real substance. Some critics went so far as to claim that the reason the gameplay was so bad, was because so much development time had been spent on making the visuals as advanced as possible, and that the reason the movement and fighting felt so sluggish was because the graphics had to use so much memory and so many frames to even convey something as simple as a straight punch. Aside from the usual commands of punches and kicks, there were only a maximum of two special moves per character, and no real combos to speak of, leading to most battles involving players resorting to using constant flying kicks against their opponent in order to take them down, a strategy seen in much older games like Yie Ar Kung Fu. In addition one of the chief complaints was that players only had one character to chose from in single player mode (Cotton) and that even in multiplayer mode one player always had to play as Cotton.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The game is set in the year 2043, in the land of Metropolis 4. An extremely large company called Electrocorp has a large amount of control over the world thanks to their technological breakthroughs in the fields of science and medicine, they have amassed a fortune greater than that of any other company or country, and have power over all the energy distribution across the planet. In this world, robots are humans servants and perform virtually every task imaginable, leaving humans to focus on developing more important technology and try to make new scientific breakthroughs. Electrocorp, as the world's leading producer and distributor of robots, has been put under great pressure due to the high demand of the increasing global population and so decide to create a supremely advanced AI which will be able to manage the company effectively and cope with the demand of the people. Thus, the Leader Project is established at the Metropolis 4 sector of the Electrocorp company. The project culminates with the creation of The Supervisor, an incredibly intelligent robot, more advanced than anything Electrocorp has ever built before, with the capacity to learn at an incredibly fast rate, along with being able to absorb knowledge from computer terminals in a matter of seconds, The Supervisor quickly exceeds all expectations of the scientists at Metropolis 4, and seems to have become the perfect robot, easily able to cope with the high levels of demand faced by the company, along with developing new ways to increase productivity and efficiency within Electrocorp. The Supervisor is granted power to control every single robot on the planet whenever it needs to.However, things do not continue to go according to plan, while running general diagnostic checks on The Supervisor at Metropolis 4, the scientists discover some new mysterious lines of data in their results and quickly learn that The Supervisor has been infected with the most advanced computer virus ever seen, the EGO virus. Normally this virus would simply destroy a computer or robot, but the effects seen on The Supervisor are completely unexpected. The Supervisor becomes self-aware, it begins to question why it has been made and why it should continue to do as it has been programmed, The Supervisor then takes on a humanoid female form as it decides to create a gender-specific identity for itself. As the virus continues to disrupt the programming put in place by Electrocorp, The Supervisor decides to disobey all orders from the company and take control of every robot on the planet, transmitting the virus to them electronically and ordering them all to rebel against their human masters, initiating a global cybernetic mutiny. The robots begin to destroy everything around them and chaos spreads across the globe, meanwhile, some scientists and officials trapped inside the plant at Metropolis 4 try to come up with a plan to destroy The Supervisor, there is no way for any of them to access her as she is guarded by an army of destructive robots, and so they decide to contact the cyborg ECO35-2, known affectionately as Coton, a half-robot, half-human creation who has not been affected by the EGO virus thanks to his organic brain, the scientists inform Coton that he is the world's only hope for survival and he must battle his way through Metropolis 4 to The Supervisor and eliminate her. Thus the battle begins, with Coton having to take on all of The Supervisor's powerful robot minions, before eventually reaching her and defeating her humanoid form in combat, thus restoring order to the planet and saving all of it's surviving inhabitants.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]ECO35-2 (Coton) - The protagonist of the story and only playable character in the single-player campaign, Coton is a cyborg with a human mind and organs, developed in secret by Electrocorp with a budget equivalent to that of the Leader Project. Despite his enemies often carrying and utilising weapons of some kind, Coton fights using only his fists, he has a thick armour plating covering his humanoid body from head to toe, and has been genetically engineered to be as fast and simultaneously powerful as possible. As stated, he has a human central nervous system and brain, no electrical components have been inserted into his body and so the EGO virus had no effect on him, allowing him to retain autonomy and take orders from the Electrocorp scientists to go after The Supervisor. All of his human organs were cloned from the CEO of Electrocorp, who in turn raised Coton as his own son, thus, when the CEO was slaughtered by rebellious robots in the beginning's of the robot mutiny of Metropolis 4, Coton wanted revenge for the murder of what he believed to be his father, thus giving him extra incentive and motive to pursue The Supervisor and destroy her.His special attacks are as follows:Turbo Head Butt - A devastating flying head butt where Coton flies across the screen towards his enemy, doing a great amount of damage if he is able to connect with the attack.Shoulder Charge - A short range barge attack, useful for getting out of corners.Loader - This is the first of six enemies Coton encounters in his quest to destroy The Supervisor. The loader, as its name suggests, was originally simply a loading droid working in the warehouses of Metropolis 4, its primary duty being to lift and carry heavy objects and load them onto trucks to be dispatched elsewhere. When it became infected with the EGO virus however, this loader became a destructive and lethal force, despite being slow-moving and ill-suited for combat, the loader has powerful attacks thanks to its heavy forked arms. As this is the first enemy in the game, it is slow moving and has poor AI, and can easily be defeated with Coton's superior speed and jumping abilities.The special attack of the Loader:Fork Slash - A mighty horizontal blow in which the Loader swings its fork arms at its opponent, slicing anything that gets in the way.Builder - The second enemy encountered in the game, the builder has the appearance of a large blue robotic gorilla, and acts in a similar fashion, using its superior upper body strength to move along on its knuckles whilst defending its relatively small and weak legs. This enemy is also slow-moving and focuses mainly on defense, forcing Coton to gradually wear it down with a rapid succession of attacks.The special attacks of the Builder:Pile Driver - This is a grab move wherein the Builder picks up Coton, spinning him upside down before slamming him down into the ground.Bomber Jump - With this move, the Builder demonstrates its surprising acrobatic abilities by leaping high into the air and slamming down to the ground, releasing a destructive shockwave upon impact.Crusher - The first relatively fast enemy encountered in the game, the Crusher has an insect like appearance, light thin legs allow for much more rapid movement than either the Loader or the Builder, and its sharp snapping pincers have the potential to do a great deal of damage should anything be caught within their grasp.The special attack of the Crusher:Pincer-Mincer - In this attack the Crusher extends its long arms, if it manages to connect with its opponent, the pincers will slowly crush the life out of them.Military - The first enemy encountered by Coton that has true fighting experience and was genuinely designed for combat, the Military droid appears humanoid in shape, can move almost as fast as Coton, and has powerful punches and kicks. This enemy has a high level of defense and is programmed to be able to quickly adapt to any combat situation, meaning that the AI for this enemy is more advanced than those that preceded it.Special attacks of the Military droid:Catapult Spin - For this attack the Military droid extends its arms and spins towards its opponent, should Coton come into contact with the spinning arms he will incur a great amount of damage.Cyber Slash - Here the Military droid reveals a hidden weapon, an extendable sword protrudes from its arm which it then uses to slash at anything in its path.Sentry - Another droid built for combat. The Sentry is a red, demonic looking robot, much stronger than the Military droid, and standing at 3.5 metres tall, the Sentry poses an intimidating challenge for Coton. The jets on its back allow it to fly for brief periods of time, and there are several in-built weapons upon the Sentry, none of which are actually utilised in game.Special attack of the Sentry:Flying Jet Kick - Here the Sentry makes use of its jetpacks to fly towards its opponent at rapid speed, delivering a destructive kick.The Supervisor - The final enemy in the game and by far the most advanced. The Supervisor appears in a humanoid female form, possessing both incredible speed and power to rival that of Coton, along with the most advanced artificial intelligence known to man, The Supervisor is certainly Coton's most difficult opponent.[CR]Sequel[CR]A sequel to the game, entitled Resurrection: Rise 2, was released for the PlayStation, Sega Saturn, and PC in 1996. It featured several of the characters from the first game, continuing the story of Coton, and once again included music written and performed by Brian May.[CR]</plot>

		<title_clean>The Ryder Cup by Johnnie Walker</title_clean>
		<plot>Ryder Cup: Johnnie Walker is a golf game based on the Ryder Cup tournament of 1993 which was played on the Belfry course. When on the field, the player has various icons available which are used to display or hide information, e.g. about the current hole and wind. The game offers two different control methods for the shot: two-click (choosing the loft from a menu and then clicking twice with the correct timing to select the power and drift) and the stroke method (after selecting the power, a miniature ball appears and the player has to click on it. The position of the click sets where the club hits the ball and therefore the drift). The latter is also available in a variant in which the ball randomly moves to make it harder.The tournament itself is a match between a European and US team with twelve athletes each. There is also the possibility to train the single holes instead of participating in the tournament.</plot>

		<plot>A Sabre Team is a squad of four elite soldiers charged with some of the toughest hostage-rescue, building-storming and the like that Western forces have ever attempted. In this turn-based strategic simulation you must choose a team of four of these from the 8 available, and take them to victory in five increasingly tough missions. Even before you get into the main gameplay, there is a lot of strategy involved in choosing weaponry, as they make different amounts of noise when used (reducing the stealth potential) and their ammunition is of varying weight.[CR]In each turn you have limited action points per soldier, which must be used for all movement, firing and reloading moves. The maps are viewed isometrically, with a compass used to indicate the directions of movement, and where the incoming fire emanated from.</plot>

		<title_clean>Seek &amp; Destroy</title_clean>
		<plot>Most of the fundamentals of this game work in a similar way to Desert Strike. You pilot a helicopter or a three-barreled tank through 14 increasingly tough multi-phase missions, each of which is preceded by a full briefing and a shopping phase. [CR]Before each phase you can enter the shop and upgrade your weaponry, paying with golden medals gathered during previous phases. Your starting weapons are the chain gun and rockets/tank shells. Every weapon has three upgrade levels. After that, you can decide how much ammunition for each weapon you want to load into your vehicle's weapon bays, switch between the tank and the chopper (which can only be done between phases, and some of them don't give you the choice), choose one of the three special weapons and adjust the fuel/armor/speed characteristics. All these preparations are surprisingly complex for a shooter like this, and a bad configuration can make the game really hard (no fuel in the middle of the desert, or a paper-thin armor are just two examples)[CR]Missions are set in the desert and jungle as well as over the sea and in snowy regions. Most often your objectives are, obviously, to seek and destroy, while performing some rescue operations and gathering as much powerups as you can. The powerups consist of ammunition, fuel, medals, and others. A scanner is installed into the vehicle to guide you, as is a mapping system and a limited shield.[CR]Unusually, the game only scrolls vertically even though you have full directional movement. When you rotate the direction the ground moves underneath you, ensuring a more realistic effect and smartly mimicking motion effects.</plot>

[CR]The game was tidied up and changed in a number of areas. The most significant change is the addition of red and yellow cards for discipline (2 yellow card offenses or one professional foul (denying your opponent a clear goal-scoring opportunity) results in that player being sent off).

		<title_clean>Shadow Fighter</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Shadow Fighter developed by the Italian team NA.P.S. and published by Gremlin Interactive is a fighting game comparabel to Mortal Kombat or SF2.[CR]It is considered to be one of the best fighting games on the Amiga and received very good ratings in several Amiga magazine reviews. The good level of sprite animation and the very good playability were highly praised as well as the separately smooth scrolling backgrounds, the great number of highly different fighters and the wide variety of standard and special moves of each character.[CR]NA.P.S a hitherto unknown and unheard developer team consisting of youths from Milan in Italy started to work on Shadow Fighter at the beginning of 1994. In November 1994 they simply sent in the game practically finished to Gremlin Interactive. Immediately Gremlin released the game without big advertising campaigns one month later at Christmas 1994. So the game development took less than a year and the game release was rather low-key beacause Gremlin had not much time to hype it up in the media.[CR]As usual at the time the game came in two different Amiga floppy drive versions. As an ECS/OCS version with 32 on-screen colors for weaker Amiga machines (like Amiga 500/600) and as an more colorful AGA version with 256 on-screen colors for enhanced Amiga machines (like Amiga1200/4000). The Amiga CD32 version came also out with 256 on-screen color graphics and additionally with CD soundtracks.[CR]AGA version (Amiga 1200)ECS/OCS version (Amiga 500)[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]There are 14 different fighting locations and 18 fighting characters in Shadow Fighter of which 16 are player-selectable and two are hidden. The two characters that can't be played are Pupazz the training dummy and Shadow the endboss of the game. But via a cheat both of them can be accessed as playable characters. Every fighter has from three up to seven special moves which can be executed by a certain joystick/pad combination.[CR]The game offers four distinct game modes:Championship Fight: This is a one-player game where you can choose one of the characters and try to fight through a tournament to finally meet and defeat the Shadow Fighter. There are three difficulty levels that can be set. Easy: Here you can only choose from the first six fighters and thereafter you will face up to ten opponents but you won't meet Shadow. Normal: Here you can choose from the first twelve fighters and you will have to win thirteen fights before you meet Shadow in the final fight. Hard: Here you can choose any of the sixteen selectable characters and you will have to win sixteen fights in your bid to fight Shadow.Training Battle: Here you will face Pupazz the practice dummy to train some special moves or combinations of any of the characters. But don't think Pupazz is defenceless and likes having the stuffing beaten out of him. He will defend himself vigorously with a variety of the most bizarre weapons like a flamethrower, a saw on an extendible arm or a gigantic fist that pops out of his neck.Single Battle: (Player vs. CPU) In this mode you select one of the 16 choosable characters and fight against a randomly chosen and computer controlled character. The CPU also selects randomly the location in which to fight.VS Battle: (Player vs. Player) Two players can pick any of the 16 selectable characters they wish and fight a duel - best out of three bouts wins. Also the location in which to fight can be chosen freely.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]NameDescriptionSpecial MovesCody[CR]Cody is the son of a[CR]US Kuto arts master.[CR]He is twenty years old[CR]and was taught by his[CR]father at an early age.[CR]Having succeed his[CR]father as master at[CR]just 16, Cody devised[CR]moves his father[CR]believed impossible.[CR]Kuto Kick[CR]Fast Puch[CR]Flying Power Kick[CR]Kuto FireballElectra[CR]She is only 19[CR]years old, but the[CR]life on the streets[CR]of France taught[CR]her all she needs[CR]to know about[CR]self-preservation.[CR]Electric Body[CR]Power Launch[CR]Earth Power Energy[CR]Electric Boomerang[CR]Double Kick[CR]Spinning Jump[CR] Fakir[CR]He is a 21 years old[CR]Pakistani who is[CR]exploring the inner[CR]mind and life force.[CR]He combines magical[CR]knowledge with fighting[CR]ability which makes[CR]him an unpredictable[CR]character to fight[CR]against.[CR]Genie Hurricane[CR]Mystery Fire[CR]Teleport[CR]Magic CarpetKrhome[CR]Of unknown age and[CR]nationality he is a result[CR]of a DNA experiment.[CR]He has complete[CR]control over his[CR]cellular structure,[CR]allowing him to morph[CR]and stretch like none[CR]of the other fighters.[CR]Grabbing Gut[CR]Liquid Silver Attack[CR]Melting BodyKury[CR]He is a large sized[CR]and 30 years old[CR]Tibetan and no one[CR]is quite sure who or[CR]what he is.

		<plot>[CR]Simon[CR]The story begins when Simon's dog "Chippy" discovers a chest in the loft of his house. Inside the chest he finds a very old and dirty book, titled " Ye Olde Spellbooke". Not interested in dusty old books, Simon throws it onto the floor. Surprisingly a magical portal appears when the book hits the floor. Being a ordinary teenager, Simon does not know what to do. However, that changes when Chippy decides to enter. Not wanting to lose his faithful dog, Simon decides to follow. After entering the portal, Simon finds himself in another world - more precisely he finds himself in a cauldron. It appears that some goblins see him as their lunch! Regretting the fact that he entered the portal, he manages to escape. Simon finds that a wizard called Calypso has been kidnapped by another wizard who goes by the name of The Evil Sordid. The only person who will send Simon back is Calypso, and so his quest begins, armed with humour, rudeness and sarcasm.[CR]Simon is voiced by UK based comedian and actor Chris Barrie who is the star of the popular TV series Red Dwarf.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Simon the Sorcerer is a point-and-click adventure game. The magical world Simon finds himself features parodies of many known fantasy stories: Narnia, Lord of the Rings, Rapunzel and The Three Billy Goats Gruff. Simon can travel around the nearby village, the forest and the mountains at the start of the game.[CR]Digital Distribution[CR]Simon the Sorcerer was re-released by Good Old Games with compatibility &amp; support for Windows XP, Vista, and 7 for both 32 and 64-bit.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Soccer Kid is a platformer from UK developer Krisalis Software, released on a multitude of systems in 1993 and 1994. The player, as the eponymous Soccer Kid, must recover the pieces of the World Cup Trophy from across the globe after a botched burglary from a group of space pirates. Soccer Kid uses his soccerball to attack enemies, and is able to control it and send it flying in different directions. If he loses the ball, he can simply summon it back to his feet by holding down the kick button.[CR]The title screen for most versions of Soccer Kid would allow the player to change the colors on the uniform Soccer Kid wears in-game to closely match their supported team. For the Super Nintendo version, the player could cycle through shirt and short colors with the shoulder buttons. [CR]For the US Super Nintendo release, the game was renamed The Adventures of Kid Kleets. The PAL version had in-game advertising for Golden Grahams cereal. The Japanese Super Famicom version of the game had new art for Soccer Kid, rendering him in a more anime style on the title screen, box art and cutscenes (the sprite remained the same).[CR]Development[CR]The original concept for the game was by Dean Lester when the company wanted to do a Mad Professor Mariarti sequel. Lester later took the same concept to Domark, who released the less successful Marko's Magic Football.[CR]</plot>

		<title_clean>Speedball 2</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]One of the most accessible yet challenging future-sports games of all time, Speedball is a cross between football / soccer and rugby with a highly aggessive streak thrown in for good measure. The objective of Speedball is to win matches by scoring more points than the opposing team, moving up through the Speedball leagues earning credits to enhance the team's armour and to hire new star players.[CR]Speedballers throw the steel ball around the pitch, shoulder charging their opponents in the process to jostle them out of the way of the scoring areas. Speedball is a violent sport and during the match it is common that some players will be injured and get carried off by the medic droids.[CR]Like a pinball machine, the Speedball arena has multiple features which can be used to score points or to gain a tactical advantage. These features include Goals, Bounce Domes, Stars, Score Multipliers, Electro-Domes and Warp Gates[CR]There are four ways to score in a game of Speedball: Throwing the ball in the opposing team's Goal = 10 points, throwing the ball against a Bounce Dome = 2 points, lighting one of the five Stars = 2 points plus a 10 point bonus for lighting all five stars and injuring an opposing player = 10 points.[CR]Score Multipliers are an important feature of the Speedball arena and entire matches can be won and lost depening on which team controls the multipliers. There are two multipliers one on each side of the arena, level with the halfway line. If a team throws the ball into a multiplier all points scored from then on will score 50% more. If that same team throws the ball into the multiplier again all points scored from then on will be doubled. This is the maximum multiplier. The opposing team can cancel this multiplier by throwing the ball into the multiplier themselves, switching off the opponets multiplier until the advantage is in the default position before adding their own multipliers by continuing to throw the ball into the Score Multiplier.[CR]Elecro-Domes charge the ball with energy so that it can be thrown through opposing players. If a team has a double multiplier the ball can be thrown into three opposing players before it loses it's charge. Electro-Domes are a powerful ally for teams struggling to beat the opposition's goal keeper since a ball charged by the Electro-Dome will knock any player to the ground upon impact.[CR]Finally, Warp Gates are placed on either side of the area, two on each end. A ball passing through a Warp Gate will emerge from the Gate on the opposite side of the arena. Throwing the ball at a diagonal angle through a warp gate can offer some useful offensive and defensive passing options.[CR]In addition to all the features of the arena, many power-ups appear which can alter the state of play. Some power-ups include: Manic: maxes out both teams stats, Freeze Team, stops the opposing team from moving for a short time, Goal Door, puts a barrier across the goal for a short time and Zap, which sends the entire opposing team crashing to the ground. Collectibles also include team boosts, coins and armour upgrades.[CR]In contrast to the extensive arena features, scoring options and power-ups, Speedball 2: Brutal Deluxe is a remarkably simple game to play. The controls make use of a joystick or similar device to move the player and a single button which takes care of everything else. The game is viewed from a top down perspective and a familiarity with the layout of the arena can make all the difference in overcoming the AI's hyper-aggressive attitude.[CR]At the beginning of the game the player takes control of Brutal Deluxe, a low level league team with 12 homogenous players with names like Nigel, Graham and Barry. Over the course of a season the player can hire star players like Gaza, Roscopp and Jams to bolster the roster and/or boost the starting players stats by buying upgrades to make them more specialised for given positions around the field.[CR]The game's management section is simple yet offers a good amount of strategy. Since star players cannot be upgraded the player must choose whether to trade out a starting player with high potential for future upgrade in favour of a short term talent injection to help score points in the early matches.[CR]Speedball 2: Brutal Deluxe offers up fast paced, high-octane action with an interesting sense of progression and team management to add to the longevity of the title. Both against the AI and another player Speedball 2: Brutal Deluxe presents a fierce and fun challenge with timeless, addictive gameplay.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>Cho is a young farmer who travels the world in search of adventure, fame, and fortune. He is asked by the king to find out the whereabouts of the evil prince Gallus, overpower him, and bring him back to the king to serve his punishment for burning down the palace and murdering Kane the previous day. If Cho succeeds in his quest, the king will hand the throne over to him. Unfortunately, Cho doesn't have anything to start off with, so he must find some weapons and protection before he starts.[CR]Your quest begins in Sharma City, where the palace resides. You can talk to people to get some hints on what to do and where to go. Along the way you may find some weapons that can be found hidden in treasure cheats or are given to Cho. Some of these weapons include swords for killing enemies, and bombs for blowing up obstacles that get in your way. Some locations have teleports (one-way only) that will get you from one place to another, and you can reveal any hidden items by shooting any flora.</plot>

		<plot>Amiga CD Sports: Football has three play modes: arcade, coach and commissioner. In arcade mode, the player has full control over all players on the field. In coach mode, only strategy decisions are made and the computer plays the game. In the third mode, the game plays entirely by itself and the player only watches.[CR]The player can select from 28 teams within a league. All players in the team have individual stats and can be substituted. During a match plays can be selected to set the next move for the player's team. Some limited control during the match in coach mode is possible, for example the player can choose who the runner should pass to next.[CR]An extensive practice mode allows the player to practice all the available moves in the game. Other features include different weather conditions and live audio commentary.</plot>

		<plot>The first game in the long-running soccer series, which stood out from the crowd with a unique forced perspective 3D view rather than a simple overhead one. The players are drawn large and there is a large scanner to assist with long passing. However, the standard mode has the ball sticking closely to the feet, which makes mazy runs upfield a more useful strategy. There are 64 international teams on offer, with a European-style knock-out cup competition included. Many different formations and strategies are offered.</plot>

As an independent mercenary working for a corporate conglomerate, you are to pilot the latest fighter subs to protect the corporate interests, and rewarded with cold hard cash. With 5 different theater of operations (of varying difficulty) and an interesting mix of aerial and submarine tactics, this game can be described as Strike Commander under the sea, without the narrative.</plot>

Some are really easy if you fast on the buttons, like Swimming and 100 meter sprint. But others like Long jump, Javelin and Archery needs more technique then hammering on the buttons.[CR]Also there is Skeet shooting, Boxing and Kayak events.</plot>

		<title_clean>Super League Manager</title_clean>
		<plot>This football management game is unique for two main reasons. Firstly, it's set in a completely fictitious game-world, with fantasy teams and players. You start off managing Folkford United, the worst team in the country, with players including Brian Evans, Nicky Moody and Bruce Roberts, and rival teams include Oldcastle, Marwick and Stoke Berry.[CR]The second difference is the lack of statistics for player details. Instead, sentences such as 'best in defence, can also play in midfield. Has been playing reasonably well. Signed for 100,000 from Oldcastle 2 years ago. Current value around 150,000' are used, and its through playing matches and noting player ratings that you interpret how good a defender he is.[CR]Another break with convention is an attempt at a human side, with players and fans communicating with you, offering advice, praise or semi-literate criticism.[CR]The training feature is more complex than usual, requiring you to select 3 activities (from a selection such as passing, gym work and lap running) for each player each week - players will complain if they feel your selections are boring or unhelpful.[CR]If you own either Emlyn Hughes' International Soccer (for the standard versions) or Wembley International Soccer (for the Amiga 1200 version) you can play around 1 match in 6, and watch all the others - otherwise you simply see a progressive score update, and can intervene with substitutions or tactical changes.</plot>

Your job is to lead the character round the platform levels making use of his special abilities to rescue and destroy.[CR]When moving, Putty has a natural bounce, and his eyes are loosely attached, moving after his body after falls (as a visual effect). He has many moves available - he can stretch himself to traverse larger gaps between (or move up/down) platforms, unleash a long-range punch, explode (which works like a smart bomb, clearing the screen of enemies) or flatten himself into a puddle on the floor (to absorb anything that walks over him).</plot>

		<plot>A vague descendant of Super Sprint with a mass of features, and one of the last multi-format games to have roots on the Amiga.[CR]A multitude of cars are available, ranging from F1 cars and Sportscars to Minis and VWs were on offer, with the option to have up to 8 of these on more powerful machines - with up to 3 different models of car. You could link 2 Amiga 1200s (or faster) and use them to display the track across 2 separate screens. There were two novelty options of sorts as well - motorized cows, and the chance to have the cars pulling caravans as you race - using the caravan to push an opponent off-line was a skill worth mastering. [CR]24 circuits are provided, all of them with walls around them to ensure crash-bang-wallop racing, and most of them have parts which cross with other parts, making collisions possible if you're much ahead of (or behind) other cars (fortunately there's no car damage). They can be raced forwards or backwards - perhaps the first game with this feature available. You could either run single races, or one of the in-built championships - one for each car, across a specially selected set of tracks.[CR]The customizable nature of the game goes even further - the number of laps can be set, as can the colour and power of the cars. As you repeatedly race a track, the markings on the course are eroded by the cars running over them.</plot>

		<plot>A vague descendant of Super Sprint with a mass of features, and one of the last multi-format games to have roots on the Amiga.[CR]A multitude of cars are available, ranging from F1 cars and Sportscars to Minis and VWs were on offer, with the option to have up to 8 of these on more powerful machines - with up to 3 different models of car. You could link 2 Amiga 1200s (or faster) and use them to display the track across 2 separate screens. There were two novelty options of sorts as well - motorized cows, and the chance to have the cars pulling caravans as you race - using the caravan to push an opponent off-line was a skill worth mastering. [CR]24 circuits are provided, all of them with walls around them to ensure crash-bang-wallop racing, and most of them have parts which cross with other parts, making collisions possible if you're much ahead of (or behind) other cars (fortunately there's no car damage). They can be raced forwards or backwards - perhaps the first game with this feature available. You could either run single races, or one of the in-built championships - one for each car, across a specially selected set of tracks.[CR]The customizable nature of the game goes even further - the number of laps can be set, as can the colour and power of the cars. As you repeatedly race a track, the markings on the course are eroded by the cars running over them.</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The Grand Master is waiting for you....[CR]Super Street Fighter II Turbo (known in Japan as Super Street Fighter II X: Grand Master Challenge) is a 2D fighting game developed by Capcom and released for the arcades on February 23, 1994.[CR]The fifth official iteration of Street Fighter II builds upon Super Street Fighter II: The New Challengers by adding new moves (such as the Super Combo, a special powerful technique for all characters that can only be activated after building up the new Super Meter) and an adjustable speed setting (which must be turned on by the operator), allowing players to ramp up the speed up to a level similar to Street Fighter II': Hyper Fighting. This also marks the first in the series to remove the bonus mini-games that occurs between every few consecutive matches.[CR]Each fighter, along with new moves, also have a variety of changes to their gameplay mechanics (for example, Ken has a wide variety of new kicks) and a new primary color palette (in similar vein to Street Fighter II': Hyper Fighting). Players can, however, play as the Super Street Fighter II: The New Challengers version of each character (removing the Super Meter, reverting most character changes, and giving the original color palette back) by inputting a special cheat code. The game also includes a new hidden boss, Akuma (known in the Japanese version as Gouki), who is shown in promotional artwork and the game's introduction sequence. Believed to be born out of the Sheng Long hoax, this fighter has a variety of powerful moves (including the ability to throw fireballs in the air) and can only be fought by progressing through the difficult single-player game without continuing under a certain condition (either achieving the high score before reaching M. Bison, or reaching M. Bison in under 25 minutes).[CR]Between 1994 and 1996, the game has been ported to the 3DO (published by Panasonic for the U.S. and European regions and published by Capcom for Japan), MS-DOS (ported by Eurocom and published by Gametek), and Amiga (including Amiga CD32, ported by Human Soft and also published by Gametek). Unlike the previous iterations of Street Fighter II, the ports authentically replicate the graphics of the arcade version. The MS-DOS and 3DO versions have remixed music (with the 3DO music having the same remixed music as the FM Towns version of Super Street Fighter II: The New Challengers). The game was also ported to the PlayStation and Saturn on November 30, 1997 as part of the Street Fighter Collection compilation and ported to the PlayStation 2 and Xbox on November 14, 2006 as part of the Capcom Classics Collection: Volume 2. The game was also ported to the Dreamcast in Japan as an exclusive mail-order release on December 22, 2000, titled Super Street Fighter II X for Matching Service. This port includes an online versus mode, the return of bonus mini-games, and hidden secrets (including two alternate versions of Akuma: Shin Gouki and Tien Gouki).[CR]Super Street Fighter II Turbo is the last official iteration for nearly ten years, proceeded by Hyper Street Fighter II: The Anniversary Edition and later by Super Street Fighter II Turbo HD Remix.[CR]</plot>

		<title_clean>Superfrog</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Hoped to be a rival to Mario and Sonic, Superfrog was the Amiga's very own icon. The game was a side-scrolling platformer with 24 levels across six different environments, developed by Team17 before their success with the Worms franchise.[CR]Plot &amp; Setting[CR]The game takes after typical fantasy cliches, with a prince and bride-to-be despised by an evil witch, who kidnaps the bride and transforms the prince into a (sentient, but physically normal) frog. At first hopeless, he is sitting by a river when a magic potion floats by and, upon drinking it, he is transformed into the SuperFrog of the title.The first five worlds of SuperFrog.[CR]In the first world, Enchanted Forest, SuperFrog hunts for the golden key required to unlock the witch's castle. After searching the Spooky Castle in the second world, he is "captured by Colin the Troll", caged and sent to a circus. His escape from the circus fills the third world, Fun Land, with the frog-prince leaving via a time machine he discovers. This takes him to the fourth world, Ancient Pyramid, but he is unable to reverse the time machine and freezes himself in suspended animation until the present day. He awakes in the fifth world, Ice Caverns, eventually arriving at a rocket which he uses to travel to the final world, the witch's Space Station. After travelling through the station he arrives at the witch's lair and rescues his bride.[CR]In the end cutscene, the two share a kiss once again, but instead of restoring the prince it transforms the bride into a frog as well.In-Game AdvertisingLucozade shown in detail in the intro.[CR]The drink Lucozade is what gives SuperFrog his powers, and a detailed bottle is shown during the intro sequence. Cans are also available as pickups throughout levels (providing substantial point bonuses among other effects), and the jackpot on the gambling machine requires three Lucozade cans.[CR]The game was one of the earliest to feature product placement, particularly a brand with little impact on the game (instead of games about brands, or sports games with real teams), but not the first.[CR]In a reversed scenario, adverts for SuperFrog are also present in the earlier Team17 game Alien Breed.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game is similar to other platformers of the time, particularly Sonic and Mario, with large 2D levels, enemies, hidden areas, high speeds, and plenty of collectibles and pickups.[CR]The game is broken into six themed worlds of four levels each - forest, castle, circus, history, ice and space - which must be played in order (though level codes can be used to start at any particular level). Levels have time limits (explained as your superpower energy expiring, with small extensions by collecting Lucozade) and can't be exited until a certain number of coins are collected. At the end of each world, SuperFrog must fight the witch in a simple boss battle.[CR]Worlds and levels often include unique features or enemies. Water is occasionally present but (as the player is a frog) harmless and only causes a small slowdown - with the exception of water in the Ice Caverns, which is filled with frozen ice spikes, and some dripping boiling water in the Fun Land, which burns SuperFrog.Pickups &amp; Collectibles[CR]All levels include a number of coins, fruit and gems, along with rarer high-scoring items and bottles of Lucozade. All add points to the player's score, with bonuses awarded for collecting large amounts of fruit/coins/Lucozade (items in hidden areas are included in these totals). Of these, only coins are required to be collected for the level's exit to open, but the number of coins on a level is always far more than the 'toll' required. An extra life is provided at every 200,000 points scored.[CR]SuperFrog starts with a number of lives (three by default, though options also allow 1 or 5), each with five health bars. Attacks from or contact with most enemies take off one piece of health, stun SuperFrog, and knock him out of the air if jumping, but also provide a short period of invulnerability to recover. Other environmental hazards such as spikes and fire will kill Superfrog immediately regardless of health or temporary invulnerability. Although some are immortal and must be avoided, SuperFrog can kill some enemies with the Destructo-Spud pickup or by jumping on them.[CR]There are also several pickups which affect SuperFrog directly:Pills, which are used immediately when picked upRestart Pills - SuperFrog spawns at the most recently-collected Restart Pill upon death (otherwise at the level start)Speedup/slowdown pills - change the speed that SuperFrog moves for a short time, and usually placed in helpful rather than dangerous placesInvisibility - SuperFrog becomes temporarily invisible (except for his eyes, to assist the player) and invulnerable to most enemiesAbilities, which last until SuperFrog dies or the level ends. Levels usually have duplicates of each; collecting extras adds score but doesn't increase the effect.Destructo-Spud - a short-range weapon that can be thrown at some enemies or objects to destroy them. It returns automatically after being thrown, can't be killed, and can be used repeatedly.Frog Wings - allow higher jumps, limited flight, and can be used to slow falls (although the game does not include fall damage, spikes and other dangers are often hidden in pits).Frog Dolls, which award an extra life immediately.Completed Level MinigameEnd of level slot machine.[CR]At the end of each level the player is awarded credits based on the time remaining, amount of fruit collected and the number of coins collected. These can be convertered directly to points to increase the player's score, or used in a slot machine for potentially bigger or better rewards. Prizes range from 10,000-75,000 point bonuses, extra lives, or a code to skip to the just-completed level (the only way to acquire them in-game). The slot machine is fairly complex, with several ways to win - gambling winnings for higher rewards, a simpler "Hi-Lo" feature, or getting three Lucozade cans which awards the Jackpot prize of points, credits and the level code.Platform-exclusive Features[CR]The Amiga versions include a bonus level between worlds 5 and 6 (i.e. approaching the Space Station), based upon the previous Team17 game Project X, named 'Project F'. The game plays like a basic side-scrolling shoot-'em-up, with the original spaceship replaced with SuperFrog in a space helmet.[CR]The PC game is the only version that includes gambling after completing the final level, including a prize of a (non-functional) level code.Other FeaturesEnd of Game Rankings[CR]Superfrog included a rating system that awarded the player a title when they finished the game, with the rank determined by overall score (and level scores determined by time, pickups, and luck/skill at the gambling machine).Mr PloppyFrog SpawnTadpole Grade 3Tadpole Grade 2Tadpole Grade 1Rookie Frog Grade 3Rookie Frog Grade 2Rookie Frog Grade 1Frog with a PurposeFrog with a MissionChuffed FrogFrog VeteranMean Green MachineSuper Frog Grade 3Super Frog Grade 2Super Frog Grade 1Frog God[CR]The game allowed high scores to be saved to a disk for 'a permanent record of your achievement', although it recommended against using the disks that SuperFrog was played from for obvious reasons.[CR]</plot>

		<title_clean>Syndicate</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Syndicate is a  cyberpunk  isometric  real-time tactical game developed by  Bullfrog Productions and released in 1993 to critical acclaim. An expansion pack,  Syndicate: American Revolt (1993) and a sequel,  Syndicate Wars (1996), have also been released. On February 22, 2012 a  remake was released by  EA Partners and developed by  Starbreeze Studios.[CR]Backstory[CR]As the world of today slipped into the future, multinational corporations grew in size and profit. They came into positions to own small countries and to exercise direct influence over the world's governments. They practically became the world's governments, undemocratically controlling the lives of people through commerce. These corporations became known as Megacorps.[CR]One of the Megacorps, a European one, invented the CHIP. A device that is inserted into the neck and stimulates the brain stem to alter a persons perception of the outside world. The CHIP numbs a person's senses to the misery and squalor around them better than any drug and sold millions around the world. It could convince a user that the sun shone when it was raining and that they were more beautiful than they really were.[CR]The CHIP, like some  drugs, also made the user open to  auto-suggestion, allowing them to be manipulated by the Megacorps. The CHIP became a perfect tool for the Megacorps to manipulating the populace and to gain power with. It didn't take long before the Megacorps were corrupted and became crime Syndicates, fighting amongst each other for monopoly over CHIP manufacturing and control over the world.[CR]And in the year of 2096, the Syndicates have not only upgraded the drug they push, but also the way they fight. Instead of using ordinary thugs, they now use teams of custom-built  cyborg  agents to do their dirty deeds.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The player takes on the role of a young executive in a small European Syndicate. The objective of the game is to spread the Syndicate's control globally.World view screen[CR]The world is divided up into 50 territories. To gain control over a territory, the player must complete a mission in that territory. Missions objectives include the assassination of an important person, the elimination of rival agents or kidnapping. Once a territory has been gained, the player can start to collect taxes within it. The taxed amount can be adjusted, but if raised too high, the population can become rebellious against the Syndicate.[CR]The player selects a mission from the World map and can then select and outfit agents with weapons and  cybernetic modifications. Between missions, the player can also research new weapons and modifications. This is necessary if the player is to achieve the ultimate goal of world domination.During a mission[CR]In the missions the player controls up to four agents from a fixed isometric view. This is to reflect the fact that the player's character is sitting in an airship high above the city map. The player tells the CHIP controlled agents where to move and where to fire. They will not react to any event unless the player activates Panic mode. During missions, the player can kill  civilians and destroy many things without consequence.[CR][B]Weapons:[/B][CR] Pistol: Very cheap, but basically worthless. Medium range. Shotgun: Short effective range, but does more damage than the hand gun. Uzi SMG: Fast rate of fire, medium range and comes with plenty of ammunition.Long Range Rifle: Very long range and extremely accurate.Flame Thrower: Devastating, but with a very short range.Mini Gun: Gatling gun with a devastating rate of fire and an incredible range. Laser Gun: Will cut through anyone or anything that gets in it way.Gauss Gun: Portable rocket launcher. Hell yeah.[CR]Special Equipment[CR]Persuadertron: A short range weapon that fires a small dose of chemicals, which will make the target lose all their free will and follow the agent who fired.Access Card: Plastic card that allows some security doors to restricted areas to be opened. Will also identify the agent carrying it as a Police officer to other Police units.Scanner: Scans for possible threats and items in the area.Time Bomb: High powered explosive that will, after a set time period, blow with devastating force.MediKit: Will restore a single agent&#8217;s health completely.Energy Shield: Will, during a very short time span, completely protect the agent against all projectile weapons.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Theme Park is a simulation management game in which the player attempts to build a famous and financially successful theme park. In order to do so, they have to purchase new rides, restaurants and other amenities as well as hiring park staff and keeping abreast of concerns like litter, bored people waiting in lines and squeezing the maximum amount of profit from their parks.[CR]Theme Park made its debut on the PC (via MS-DOS) and Amiga home computers. It would eventually be ported to Sega Genesis, Super Nintendo, Atari Jaguar and CD-based systems like the Amiga CD32, PlayStation, Sega Saturn and 3DO. The MS-DOS CD version featured Full Motion Videos of some of the rides.[CR]The game was also remade for the Nintendo DS in 2009 by EA Japan and on iOS around the same time. The PlayStation version was later rereleased on the PlayStation Network. Theme Park was followed by two sequels: Sim Theme Park/Theme Park World and Theme Park Inc/SimCoaster.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]World map screen showing different plots of land available for purchase.[CR]Like most management games, Theme Park starts the player off with a plot of land that they have to develop. The player can build many things found commonly at an amusement park, such as roller coasters and Ferris wheels, all of which can attract more customers. Players are able to set prices, hire new staff and generally maintain the plot. The aim of the game is to make the theme park as valuable as possible so that it can be sold and a new plot can be bought somewhere else in the world. The player then starts to make a new theme park and the process is repeated.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Britt Alcroft's train-based characters (famously voiced by Ringo Starr) were brought to several computer games, and this is perhaps the most unusual, simplifying the game of pinball to aim it at younger players. Four different tables are included, based loosely around Thomas, James, Percy and Toby. Up to 8 players can take it in turns, and there are 3 skill levels and a high score table.[CR]The tables vary in their complexity and difficulty; Thomas' is very basic in its design, while the others (especially Toby's) have more advanced ramps and combos. Full screen and scrolling view modes are available, and the game's feel is comparable to the Pinball Dreams series, which is unsurprising as Spidersoft did Pinball Mania themselves.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]In Top Gear 2, players race on tracks spanning the globe, earning money for upgrades along the way. Tracks feature backgrounds from each country like Australia, Great Britain and Japan. Some tracks feature weather effects like rain, snow or fog. Each event features 20 racers for the player to drive against. The game uses a password system, rather than saving progress.[CR]Career[CR]The game features a robust career mode featuring 16 territories with 4 tracks from each. After each race, players are given points that go towards that country's ladder ranking. The player must be at the top of the ladder at the end of the 4 races in order to qualify to move on to the next territory. The territories are (in order)Australasia (Australia and New Zealand)BritainCanadaEgyptFranceGermanyGreeceIndiaIrelandItalyJapanScandinaviaSpainSwitzerlandUnited States[CR][B]Upgrades:[/B][CR]In addition to points for rankings, after races players are given money to put towards upgrading cars. Money can also be picked up by driving over icons that sometimes appear on tracks. Players can upgrade:Engine - Boosts top speedDry Tires - Helps the car turn betterWet Tires - Used on rainy tracksGearbox - Increases the number of gearsNitro - Each upgrade adds one more burst of nitro during racesSide/Rear/Front Armor - Decreases the amount of damage takenRespray - Changes the color of the car. Resprays are free upgrades[CR]Critical Reception[CR]When the SNES version was released Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the review scores of 7,7,7,6 and 6 out of ten. Mike Weigand, who gave the score of 6, wrote, "...if you liked Top Gear, then you will probably also like Top Gear 2! This time there are some improvements over the original -- most notably the scrolling is much smoother! Good weather conditions, too".[CR]</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Reporters uncover Ackboob's sinister plan[CR]Total Carnage is an Arcade top-down dual-joystick shooter and is often seen as a spiritual successor to Midway's earlier Smash TV. It was developed by Mark Turmell who was also the lead designer for Smash TV. Other similarities between the two titles lies in the sound: Jon Hey composed the music and Ed Boon supplied some voice work for Total Carnage as they both did for Smash TV.[CR]Total Carnage was released across many home consoles along with its original arcade release.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]Ackhboob's mutant factory[CR]The year is 1999 and a new world war is brewing. The war is against a country ruled by the evil General Ackboob, and he has closed his country off from the rest of the world. Reporters discover that he is hiding a Baby Milk Factory, but as they dig deeper they find that this is not the truth. The factory is actually manufacturing an army of mutants that could help Ackboob take over the world. The United States sends in only two soldiers, named Captain Carnage and Major Mayhem, to stop Ackboob's evil plan. They are tasked in destroying hordes of mutant troops, rescuing hostages and defeating Genral Ackboob.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Mutant bosses are big and ugly.[CR]Total Carnage is a bloody shooter that plays from a overhead perspective. One to two players can enter a game, and the goal is to shoot all enemies on screen. Each character can face all directions on the screen, and their only ability is to shoot. Different weapons can be collected that will give the players extra power. Each level will have them shooting through small enemies, and they will eventually meet a boss. Each boss is a large mutant monster that has a specific weak point to defeat them. There is the occasional mini game which will have the player pressing a button rapidly. One of the mini games has them attempting the execute General Ackhboob in an electric chair.[CR]Keys[CR]Upon collecting the first key, a message appears that upon collecting 220 keys, it grants the player to reach the Pleasure Dome which contains a huge score bonus.[CR]</plot>

		<title_clean>Trivial Pursuit - The CD32 Edition</title_clean>
		<plot>This is the earliest home computer incarnation of Horn Abbot International Ltd's classic board game, Trivial Pursuit. The game involves answering questions on one of six subject categories to gain moves, and answering questions on special squares to gain one of the six 'Wedges' you need to gain the right to take on the final winning question. Questions are aimed at British players - many entertainment questions are based on British TV, and sport questions relate to popular British sports.[CR]Two game modes are available:- single player (which involves answering questions against the clock) and multiplayer (where you can take on up to five human-controlled players). The computer reveals the answer, and you select 'yes' or 'no' to tell it whether you got it right.[CR]The question categories are exactly the same as the board game, however two different question styles are added to take advantage of computer technology - some questions relate to a picture or diagram and some relate to a piece of music. [CR]One additional feature not available in the board game is a statistical analysis of the number and type of questions answered correctly. This can be split into the performances of all the players, or the performance of an individual player within the six categories. It is especially useful at the end of the game, when choosing which category a player must answer to win the game.</plot>

		<plot>This platform game features the small blue-haired cutesy creatures that were popular around the time (although surely not with most computer game buyers?). You play a Troll roaming the levels in the hope of rescuing as many baby trolls as possible - each level gives you a set minimum to retrieve before you can leave via the Pigstop.[CR]Initially you have no weapons, and contact with the nasties costs you energy, but a Yo-Yo can be collected, which can be used not only to kill enemies, but also to smash blocks away and open up paths, and even (with practice) tied to a ledge to allow you to swing across a gap. [CR]Throughout the levels you will find the letters B,O,N,U,S and G released from bonus balloons or on killing an enemy - if at the end of a level your letters spell out Bonus or Bogus you go to the appropriate extra level. The former has a chance to gain extra lives, the latter must be escaped quickly to avoid losing a life.</plot>

		<title_clean>UFO - Enemy Unknown</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The Geoscape.[CR]Originally released in the UK as UFO: Enemy Unknown; X-COM: UFO Defense combines challenging turn-based gameplay with base building, research management, and persistent squad members.[CR]The game was originally released in 1994 for PC, Amiga, and Amiga CD32. It was also later released for the PlayStation. X-COM: UFO Defense, along with four other X-COM games, were released digitally via Steam on September 4, 2008[CR]Throughout the game, players will encounter a multitude of alien races that are intent on subjugating the people of Earth. The Extraterrestrial Combat Unit must prevent this from happening by tracking and shooting down UFOs, stopping terror attacks on major cities, and eliminating alien bases before they can infiltrate governments across the world.[CR]Bases, workers and squad destinations are managed in the Geoscape view, before switching to the battlescape view for missions.[CR]Troops sent on missions improve with the actions they take and can individually be equipped with a variety of firearms and grenades. Upon elimination of all the aliens on the battlescape, alien artifacts will be returned to the base, where players can assign scientists to start researching different weapons and technology. New weapons, gadgets, and aircrafts can be manufactured by engineers, adding items like medpacks, hover tanks, and plasma weapons to the arsenal.[CR]Development[CR]UFO: Enemy Unknown was originally conceived as a sequel to Laser Squad, another game by Julian Gollop.[CR]Scenarios[CR]Troops leave their Skyranger to investigate a small UFO.[CR]Shooting down UFOs will allow a transport ship to land at the crash site, where troops will be tasked with eliminating any surviving aliens. All missions play out in turns, with the player always going first. Troops have Action Points that are depleted by everything from moving and shooting to turning and priming grenades.[CR]Alien weaponry is far superior to the the troops' ballistic rifles and heavy cannons, requiring caution to keep squad members alive. Reaction fire allows soldiers to save action points for the alien turn, and, depending on an individual's reaction stat, he or she may fire on an alien that moves into line of sight. UFOs may also land; players can take advantage of this by sending transport ships to catch the aliens off guard. Research rewards are often better, as the UFO itself is not damaged, unlike when alien crafts are shot down. However, this also means that there will be more aliens to contend with on the ground.[CR]Terror missions are arguably the most difficult, as they occur at inopportune times around the world and last only a few in game days, leaving little time to prepare before the city is ransacked. Failing or ignoring these missions will make the local government unhappy, which might lead to funding cuts at the end of the month. In terror missions, the aliens set out to kill as many civilians as possible, so players must attempt to protect citizens by quelling the alien threat as quickly as possible.[CR]Aliens also will try to construct bases on Earth, as evidenced by heavy UFO activity in certain countries (a month by month stat page can help highlight this information). These missions are completed by killing or capturing all aliens inside. It is worth noting that at the core of the bases, a high-ranking alien can usually be found who will yield valuable information if taken alive and interrogated.[CR]The world map progresses with time, and missions can be taken during night or day. All the aliens have the unique advantage of seeing as well at night as day. Therefore players can opt to wait until daylight to attempt a given mission, in order to not be at a disadvantage.[CR]Aliens[CR]A sectoid.[CR]There are five alien races, each with an associated support unit, usually only seen on the terror missions or within their bases.[CR] Sectoids[CR]The Sectoids are based on the greys. They pair with Cyberdiscs - mini UFOs that hover and shoot, but explode when destroyed.Snakemen[CR]The aptly named Snakemen are physically tough units that team up with the terrifying Chryssalids, fast moving bipedal insects that turn their victims into zombies, which can then turn into more Chryssalids.Floaters[CR]Floaters have no legs, and instead float around and guide their giant accomplices, the Reapers.Mutons[CR]Purple and green Mutons, who couple with Celatids - purple floating creatures that shoot acid. They're also accompanied by Silacoids, which are essentially big moving rocks.Ethereals[CR]The orange robed Ethereals have the strongest psychic powers, and have a mechanized form of the Reaper for their terror missions called Sectopods.[CR]Base Building[CR]The Base management screen.[CR]Construction of multiple bases is critical to later success, though funding and management of multiple bases provides it's own challenge. Players must hire and pay all personnel and also pay upkeep for various facilities on a monthly basis. Radar systems, storage areas, living quarters, research, and manufacturing areas may also be constructed. Later, base defenses, alien containment, and more hangar space become important to the mission. Management of weapons and ammunition for troops and ships also occur here.[CR]Should an X-COM base be invaded by hostile forces, the base will need to be defended by the player's forces within that base. Aliens will infiltrate through possible entry zones, like gun ports and hangars. Supplies that aren't allocated to soldiers will be in storage areas. Not all of the base is well-lit, particularly hangars, making visibility a problem. Creating defensive structures and bottlenecks around entry points are ways to minimise the damage taken during base defence scenarios. If players fail one of these missions, the base will be lost.[CR]Research &amp; Development[CR]'Laser Defences' in the UFOpedia.[CR]Hiring and utilizing scientists and engineers allows progress in the game, both technologically and story-wise. More powerful and varied weapons are made available, as well as personal armor, building types, and information about the aliens. Psychic research also becomes part of the gameplay, allowing the player's troops to use the alien's mind control abilities against them. The later aircraft are necessary for completing the game, and only by bringing in live aliens will scientists discover a way to eradicate the alien menace. Learning about the aliens opens up new avenues of research, propelling players toward having the tools to bring about the game's conclusion - as long as enough scientists are allocated to the task.[CR]UFO Interception[CR]When pursuing enemy craft with an aircraft on the Geoscape, players may get within firing range. This spawns an interceptor minigame, which pits the player's craft against a UFO. Smaller UFOs tend to be more fragile and less heavily armed, while the top-of-the-line enemy ships can easily destroy more basic X-COM crafts - especially if the aircraft's armament doesn't have sufficient range. When at a stand-off distance, players can minimize the pursuit window to manage other on-screen events (like other pursuit craft).[CR]On the interception screen, the green-colored field on the far left of the pop-up visualizes the player's distance to the enemy, and the range and ammunition that the player's weapons have. The four upper-right buttons are the approach tactics (clockwise from upper left):The interception screen.Standoff - maintain maximum distance but continue pursuitLong distance attack - fires at a low rate of fire and at maximum possible distanceModerate attack - fires all weapons at minimum necessary distancePoint blank - charge right at the enemy vehicle, weapons blazing. This increases damage potential but puts the interceptor at greater risk[CR]The silhouette of the X-COM craft shows the percentage of damage that the craft has taken, this is indicated by glowing red, starting from the tip and working its way to the back.[CR]The final two buttons are retreat, and visualize enemy. The former simply disengages from combat, which flies back to base. The latter shows players what the enemy craft looks like.[CR]Finally, there is a numerical distance rating that corresponds to the representation on the left.[CR]Should the player's craft be able to land and deploy troops, and players force the enemy to crash-land or it lands on its own, players will instantly land and begin a ground mission. It's also possible that the enemy could run away, destroy the X-COM craft, cause the player to retreat, be completely destroyed, or crash into the sea.[CR]PC Requirements[CR]Supported OS: Microsoft 2000/XP/VistaProcessor: 80386 processor or betterMemory: 4Mb RAMSound Cards Supported: AdLib compatible cards, SoundBlaster compatible cards and the Roland LAPC[CR]</plot>

		<plot>"Vital Light" is one of those innovative games which only appear once a while. In this particular one, you have to control a small paint gun that contains five different colored paints, and destroy blocks that are falling toward you by making them all the same color. Your paint gun is on a roller at the bottom of the screen, and horizontal strips of colored blocks fall from the top of the screen at varying speeds. Holding down the fire button and pushing left or right changes the currently selected color, and sometimes you only just have enough time to get the right color before the blocks smash into you. As the blocks fall at varying speeds, there are times when an avalanche is set off by a slow block being hit by a fast moving block above it. This is a game that gets very, very frantic.</plot>

		<plot>Following on from Brutal Sports Football came this interpretation of soccer, released alongside the 1994 World Cup. In one player mode you can play a Wild Cup or a League system; two player games are restricted to single Unfriendly matches.[CR]Unlike its predecessor the game uses an isometric viewpoint, perhaps because the original FIFA was so popular at the time. A number of vicious moves are on offer, with tackles Vinnie Jones would flinch at along with lethal head-butts and shoulder barges. If a game finishes drawn, it goes into a Penalty Shoot Out, which involves going round shooting the opposition; the last team standing wins. The pre-match screens include attacking at defensive play styles, transfers and the chance to buy items such as rocket launchers and shields.</plot>

		<title_clean>Worms</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Worms' Main Menu (DOS)[CR]Originally created by Andy Davidson for the Amiga, and later ported to a variety of other systems by Team17, Worms is the first iteration of the long-running Worms series of turn-based strategic artillery games. As in subsequent games, the goal of Worms is to use a team of well-armed annelids to kill worms of opposing human or A.I. players; in each round, the last player with living worms is declared the winner. Worms was first published by Ocean Software Ltd. in 1995, and in addition to its original platform, it has appeared on the Amiga CD32, PC, Game Boy, Genesis, Jaguar, Macintosh, PlayStation, Saturn, and SNES; in fact, it has been ported to more systems than any other Worms game. A version of the title was even considered for Nintendo's Virtual Boy at one point, though Team17 co-founder Martyn Brown stated in 2008 that the Virtual Boy port never truly made it into the development stages due to a sentiment that the platform was "doomed to failure".[CR]The DOS version of Worms was followed up by Worms: Reinforcements, an expansion to the original game, in late 1995; the following year Worms and Reinforcements would be released as a single package under the name Worms United. Worms would later be released on Steam in 2011 and GOG.com in 2012, though in both cases the version sold is Worms United, not the original game. After completing Worms Davidson would also head up the development of Worms: The Director's Cut, released in 1997, which was an Amiga-exclusive version of Worms that featured a large number of new weapons and game options not previously seen in other iterations of the game, many of which were adopted in Worms 2, released the same year. Both 2006's Worms: Open Warfare and 2007's Worms are considered remakes of the original Worms due in large part to similarities in their weapon loadouts.[CR]Development[CR]Worms was originally conceived not as a commercial product, but as a distraction for creator Andy Davidson, a fan of local multiplayer games like Bomberman and Super Mario Kart, and his high school friends. It was initially built using borrowed assets from Psygnosis' Lemmings, and the earliest version of Worms was known as Lemartillery as a result. The game eventually became so popular among the students of Davidson's school that it was banned entirely, prompting Davidson to consider the possibility of having his game published. In order to make the game more attractive to would-be publishers, however, the game's graphics had to be reworked, and thus Davidson scrapped the original lemmings on favor of worms, giving this new iteration the name Total Wormage. Davidson was so intent on getting his game published that after high school he decided to forgo the pursuit of higher education in order to do so. While he continued to work on the game, Davidson used the customers of an Amiga store where he worked as a form of playtesting for Total Wormage.[CR]In one of his efforts to get his game noticed, Davidson submitted Total Wormage into a competition held by Amiga Format, a British Amiga magazine. By Davidson's own admission, though, his entry into the contest did not accomplish what he had hoped, as he neither won nor received any mention in the magazine. Although discouraged by this and a number of failed attempts at garnering attention for Total Wormage by mailing copies to publishers and developers, Davidson had one final idea: to take the game to the European Computer Trade Show in London. This would prove to be the turning point in Davidson's fortunes, as while there he demoed the game to Team17, who showed an immediate interest in it. Team17 offered to help Davidson develop and publish the game; much of their work went into porting Worms to other game systems, as the original Amiga version that Davidson had been working on was by this time fairly well-developed. In total, Davidson estimates that he spent about four years of his life in the development of Worms.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] in Worms consists of actions taken by between two and four teams of human- or A.I.-controlled worms on a two-dimensional playing field. The game is turn-based, with each player being able to move a single worm per turn; turns typically end once a worm has either fired a weapon or sustained damage, although they can also end automatically if the allotted time for a turn runs out. From there, play shifts to the next player in the sequence, which is determined randomly at the beginning of gameplay, and that player proceeds in the same fashion. The objective of worms at all times is to cause as much damage to enemy worms as possible while also preserving one's own worms. Each worms starts the round with a certain amount of hit points (typically one hundred), and if their hit points are reduced to zero, they will die, leaving behind a gravestone and creating a small explosion that can harm nearby worms. Worms can also be killed instantaneously by being knocked outside the boundaries of the level or into liquid substances that reside at the bottom of the stage. If a player loses all four of their worms, they are eliminated, and the winner of a given round is the player that survives the match without being eliminated.A Banana Bomb causing widespread destruction. At top, opposing players' health bars can be seen; within the lower HUD, a wind strength indicator (top right) and power bar (bottom right) are visible.[CR]Each player starts the match with an assortment of armaments and utilities in order to aid them in their goal of dominating their opposition. This includes staple weapons such as bazookas and grenades, which can be used frequently, to more powerful weaponry such as homing missiles and dynamite that can only be used a finite number of times. Worms also contains a handful of "super weapons" such as banana bombs and explosive sheep, which can only be obtained through periodic weapon crate drops during a match; these items are extremely potent, though incredibly rare to find. Some weapons require that the player be able to accurately gauge the proper weapon trajectory and launch power necessary to hit a target, which can be further complicated by the inclusion of wind conditions that can affect certain projectiles while in flight. In addition to weapons, Worms also offers a number of movement utilities designed more for defense or traversal than offense; this includes items like ninja ropes and teleporters, which allow different ways of moving around the environment, and items like blow torches and pneumatic drills that can carve through obstructions.[CR]Environments in Worms are completely destructible, and almost all weapons cause some amount of deformation to the terrain. Over time, this reduces the size of the overall play area, making defensive positioning increasingly difficult while simultaneously increasing the danger that players will fall or be forced off of the map. In order to help make the game more replayable, levels in Worms are also randomly generated, and prior to a match players can cycle through maps indefinitely until they find one to their liking. Several other aspects of the game are adjustable as well, though not all of these variables have a dramatic affect on gameplay. Team and individual worm names can be changed, starting hit point totals can be set between seventy-five and five hundred points, and the intelligence level of A.I. opponents can be tweaked. The availability of all of the game's default weapons can be tailored to suit personal tastes, and Sudden Death, a late-game stalemate breaker that reduces all worms to one hit point, can be made to occur sooner, later, or not at all. A number of other variables exist as well, such as default worm placement and turn length, and an optional Banzai mode is also included which makes explosions even more destructive.[CR][B]Weapons:[/B][CR]The Worms arsenal includes more than twenty weapons and utilities that vary in strength and purpose. All but three of these tools are given automatically to the player during a match, while the others are designated as "super weapons," and must be collected from randomized weapon crates (although these crates can also contain other weapons or booby traps). A wide variety of different armaments are represented in Worms, including melee weapons, firearms, and a variety of explosives that may be thrown, dropped, propelled by rockets, or conveyed in less-than-orthodox ways. Some usable items are classified as utilities, and while these objects may cause damage to enemies in some cases, the intent of utility items is generally to offer worms additional mobility or defensive options. Weapons can be selected either by right-clicking in order to bring up a weapon selection panel or by hitting their associated function key.BazookaBazookaDamage: Up to 50 HPHotkey: F1 One of the go-to weapons of Worms, the Bazooka fires a single explosive shell in a trajectory and at a velocity determined by the player. Provided that it successfully finds its target, it does a solid amount of damage and causes a fair amount of concussive force as well. It also destroys a sizable chunk of the surrounding landscape. Bazooka usage is unlimited by default, and it can be extremely useful to skilled players. Its course is heavily influenced by wind, however, requiring some amount of compensation in gusty conditions.Homing MissileHoming MissileDamage: Up to 50 HPHotkey: F1 (2x) The Homing Missile is similar to the Bazooka in many respects, though it has one crucial difference. Prior to being fired, the player is able to select a point on the map that the Homing Missile will zero in on after it takes flight. Though it's tracking capability is far from perfect, with foresight it can be used to hit almost any target that is not hidden underground. Due to the increased accuracy over the Bazooka, it is easier to propel worms in a desired direction with it, though just like the Bazooka it is affected by wind.GrenadeGrenadeDamage: Up to 50 HPHotkey: F2 Being equal in strength to the Bazooka, the Grenade is another of Worms' staple weapons, and similarly it is a deadly weapon in the hands of a seasoned player. One of the Grenade's main advantages is the fact that it is not affected by wind at all, and thus two Grenades thrown at the same angle and strength will always have the same trajectory. A Grenade also does not explode on impact, but instead possesses an adjustable fuse that automatically detonates it after a preselected number of seconds (between one and five).Cluster BombCluster BombDamage: Up to 25 HP per impactHotkey: F2 (2x) The Cluster Bomb takes after the Grenade in terms of its low susceptibility to wind and adjustable fuse length. Once the fuse is detonated, it splits into five distinct explosives that scatter and fall to the ground, causing additional damage to any worms within a short vicinity of the initial blast. While each individual explosion is less damaging than the force of a Grenade, combined they can cause far greater damage. The natural target for a Cluster Bomb is not a single worm but a gathering of enemy worms situated fairly close to each other.Banana BombBanana BombDamage: Up to 75 HP per impactHotkey: F2 (2x) The Banana Bomb can be thought of as a version of the Cluster Bomb, though a far more destructive one. After a Banana Bomb has been thrown and its timer expires, five deadly bananas are unleashed that fly into the air and explode immediately upon contact with the ground. Each banana is akin to a single stick of Dynamite, and the combined detonation can kill several worms, or even an entire team of worms, relatively easily. Due to its potentially enormous area of effect, the Banana Bomb is a frequent source of self-injury.ShotgunShotgunDamage: Up to 25 HP per shotHotkey: F3 The Shotgun is one of three point-and-shoot firearm weapons in Worms, and its main distinction over its brethren is the ability to shoot twice in a single turn. Even though the damage it causes with each shot is somewhat on the low side, it affords some strategic possibilities that are not possible with other weapons. A player can use it, for example, to attack two different worms in a single turn even if they are not close to one another; alternately, it can be used to attack once before using the remainder of the turn to seek a defensive position.UziUziDamage: Up to 50 HPHotkey: F3 (2x) Using the Uzi unleashes a short stream of bullets in a specified direction. If all hits connect, it causes a significant amount of damage, and there are other benefits to the weapon as well, as it creates a significant amount of pushback that can be used to propel enemy worms into hazards such as mines or water. The downside of this property is that it is at times difficult to get the maximum amount of damage from the weapon. Perhaps the best way to ensure this is to use the Uzi against enemies that have their backs against a wall.MinigunMinigunDamage: Up to 75 HPHotkey: F3 (2x) The Minigun is essentially a more deadly version of the Uzi, and as such its applications are fairly similar. Like the Uzi, it is unlikely that all bullets will hit their target unless said worm is pinned against a solid surface, though the damage boost of the Minigun makes this drawback less of an issue. It is an extremely good tool for pushing worms around the landscape and into peril. Because of its wide bullet spread, the Minigun is best used from close range, though care should be taken, as it is possible to damage oneself with it.Fire PunchFire PunchDamage: 30 HPHotkey: F4 Upon activating the Fire Punch ability, a worm will unleash a Street Fighter-inspired Dragon Punch that damages an opponent and sends them flying across the map. The trajectory of the Fire Punch's knockback is arguably its most advantageous attribute, as the actual injury caused by the attack is somewhat modest. More often than not, the Fire Punch is either used to knock an opponent off of a precipice, hopefully to their death, or as a stylish way of finishing off a worm that is nearly dead already. It can also strike worms above the player.Dragon BallDragon BallDamage: 30 HPHotkey: F4 (2x) The Dragon Ball ability creates a short-range fireball that damages the first worm it touches. It is similar to the Fire Punch in many ways, and even does the same amount of damage on hit, though it is more horizontally oriented. This goes not only for the attack itself, which travels horizontally as opposed to the Fire Punch's vertical movement, but also the result of the attack. Enemies hit by a Dragon Ball will be thrown a great distance but will not gain much altitude, which can be used to great effect to push worms into mines or water.DynamiteDynamiteDamage: Up to 75 HPHotkey: F5 A simple yet undeniably powerful weapon, the Dynamite stick is a dropped explosive device with an extremely large blast radius. Since it must be placed manually, the user is required afterwards to beat a hasty retreat lest they fall victim to their own destructive predilections. It leaves a very large crater in its wake, and any worms within its range when it detonates sustain heavy damage. Dynamite is the most potent weapon in Worms that is not considered to be a "super weapon," and by default it is available in very limited supply.MineMineDamage: Up to 50 HPHotkey: F5 (2x) Deployed in the same manner as the Dynamite stick, the Mine may be a step down in terms of power, but it has uses that Dynamite does not. It can of course be placed directly on top of a worm so that it will activate and explode immediately, but it can also be used as a defensive tool, which can be particularly useful in securing underground tunnels. Against A.I opponents, its defensive utility is somewhat diminished, as computer worms tend to move around far less than human ones, reducing the chances of mine activation significantly.SheepSheepDamage: Up to 75 HPHotkey: F5 (2x) Seemingly innocuous at a glance, the Sheep is in truth one of the deadliest weapons in Worms. Once released, the Sheep will amble along while trying to bound over any obstacles it might encounter. When the fire button is pressed a second time, the Sheep will detonate, creating a blast equal to Dynamite in terms of its size and lethality. The Sheep negates one of the primary drawbacks of Dynamite, that being that players must place it themselves; Sheep can have some difficulty navigating uneven terrain, though, so flat surfaces work best.Air StrikeAir StrikeDamage: Up to 75 HPHotkey: F6 Calling in an Air Strike orders an aircraft to perform a bombing run over a targeted area. When initiated, the player is asked to select a target zone in a manner similar to the target selection of the Homing Missile; in the case of the Air Strike, the selected point is then used as the bull's eye for an immediate missile bombardment. Explosives fall in a fairly large area around the target, making it an attractive way to cause heavy damage to a large cluster of worms, though it does require a fairly clear path to its target in order to be effective.TeleportTeleportDamage: NoneHotkey: F6 (2x) The Worms equivalent of a Get Out of Jail Free card, the Teleport instantaneously transports a single worm to any point on the map the player so desires. This can be used in situations where a worm is surrounded by hostile worms, and it is also a popular way to collect weapon crates. Using a teleport immediately ends the worm's turn, so it is important to ensure that doing so will not leave the player vulnerable to attack in subsequent turns. As the most powerful movement tool in the game, its use is severely restricted by default.Blow TorchBlow TorchDamage: 15 HP per hitHotkey: F7 The Blow Torch allows a worm to carve into the environment either horizontally or at an angle. While it does cause a pittance of damage to worms in its path, the primary purpose of the Blow Torch is in tunneling through the map to reach new areas or building underground defensive structures that shield worms against attack. This is a particularly vexing problem for opposing worms, as burrowed worms can't be attacked easily in many scenarios, often forcing players to waste several turns in an attempt to infiltrate or destroy enemy defenses.DrillDrillDamage: 15 HP per hitHotkey: F7 (2x) Unlike the Blow Torch, the Drill burrows into the environment in only one direction: down. Though this is not intended for offensive purposes, it has more damage potential than the Blow Torch, as a worm can in some cases become stuck in the hole created by the Drill and continue to take damage. Unfortunately, worms who use the Drill to escape enemy fire are more vulnerable to attack than those hidden in horizontal tunnels. This is because it is a fairly simple matter to drop a Grenade, Cluster Bomb, or other ordinance on their heads.Ninja RopeNinja RopeDamage: NoneHotkey: F8 Aside from walking and jumping, the Ninja Rope is arguably the most important means of locomotion in Worms. Casting a Ninja Rope will attach a worm to any solid surface via rope, and from there the player is free to extend and retract the rope and also swing back and forth to gain momentum. In this way players are able to rapidly traverse large sections of the map and access areas that might otherwise be inaccessible. Most importantly, using the Ninja Rope does not end the player's turn, leaving worms free to attack their foes afterwards.BungeeBungeeDamage: NoneHotkey: F8 (2x) Having the Bungee utility selected allows the player the freedom to walk off of cliffs without fear of sustaining fall damage. Dropping from a precipice activates the item automatically, and from there the player can control their movements on the Bungee cord. It behaves somewhat like a springier version of the Ninja Rope, and like the Ninja Rope the player can detach from it at any time by hitting the fire button. The player's turn does not end once the worm dismounts the cord, so the remainder of their turn can be played out as normal.GirderGirderDamage: NoneHotkey: F9 Offering a number of strategic possibilities, the Girder utility is the only usable item in Worms that creates a terrain feature rather than destroying one. Using a Girder allows the player to place a long solid metal beam that acts like all other solid objects in the game. For allied worms, this can be a useful means of protection or a way to assist mobility, and it can also be used as a way to restrict the movements of enemy worms. Girders can have their orientation rotated at will and their size adjusted prior to being placed on the map.KamikazeKamikazeDamage: 30 HPHotkey: F10 True to its name, the Kamikaze attack is a one-way proposition for any worm that chooses to utilize it. The idea is that the worm in question will fly forth and explode violently, causing damage to enemy worms while sending them flying. Since worms are the player's most valued resource, it is a tool to be avoided if at all possible. The ideal candidate for a Kamikaze attack is a worm that is near death and would likely die before their next turn anyway. Even so, it is usually only worth considering if the blast will affect multiple worms.ProdProdDamage: NoneHotkey: F11 The Prod is the ultimate Worms insult: an attack that does no damage. By standing next to another worm and issuing a Prod command, the player's worm will give a gently nudge to the adjacent worm that will push them forward ever so slightly. Nothing more, nothing less. The only practical application of this ability is in the event that an enemy worm can be pushed off of or into something, and even then there are weapons that can accomplish the same while also causing damage directly. It is used primarily to humiliate an opponent.Skip GoSkip GoDamage: NoneHotkey: F9 (2x) As it implies, Skip Go allows a player to prematurely end their worm's turn without taking any further action. This can be useful if a worm has no viable means of attack or if the player simply wishes to force their opponent's hand. If a worm is burrowed safely underground, for instance, a player might decide to skip their turn rather than risk retaliation by leaving and going on the offensive. Skipping a turn also has the effect of allowing more turns before the onset of Sudden Death, which is activated based on play time rather than turn count.SurrenderSurrenderDamage: NoneHotkey: F10 (2x) By selecting Surrender and pressing the fire button a player can at any point raise the proverbial white flag and remove themselves from play voluntarily. In a two-player match, this ends the round automatically, though if two or more players remain after a Surrender then play will continue until only one team remains. It should be noted that surrendered worms will remain on the playing field even after they are no longer in competition; aside from their lack of any agency in the match, these worms behave as they normally would.[CR][B]Reception:[/B][CR]Worms was fairly well-received upon its release in 1995, and many critics commending it for having easy-to-grasp yet strategic gameplay, a humorous, lighthearted presentation, and a great deal of customization options and replayability. The original version received a great deal of positive attention from the Amiga gaming press, with a large number of review scores falling within the ninetieth percentile. Ironically, Amiga Format, the very same British publication that had failed to acknowledge Davidson's game when he submitted it into their yearly Amiga game competition, issued a glowing post-release review of Worms in their 1995 Christmas issue, saying that it "thoroughly deserves to be a real smash."[CR]</plot>

		<title_clean>Zool - Ninja of the 'Nth' Dimension</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Zool is a platformer originally developed by Gremlin Graphics for the Commodore Amiga, and was later ported to multiple other platforms. It follows  Zool, a ninja from the Nth Dimension who has crash landed on a mysterious planet and must traverse many different levels.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The gameplay in Zool is side-scrolling platforming gameplay in which the player's aim is merely to reach the end of the level, where a gold coin would be collected. Obstacles and enemies litter the 2D worlds, and the game is known for being very difficult. Zool has the ability to perform jumps, punches, kicks, sliding tackles, fire a "magic cannon" weapon and perform 4 different magic spells. The magic spells vary greatly, and include an invincibility spell, a fire blast spell which kills all enemies on screen, a duplication spell which creates a second Zool, doubling the players fire power and one that increases his jumping ability. Zool can also climb walls by clinging onto the wall, and jumping upwards before clinging to it again.[CR]At intervals within a level there are checkpoints, which are different items in each world. Upon passing the point it will activate, and if the player is killed, Zool will respawn at the checkpoint. Zool can take 4 hits of damage before dying, and can replenish his life with flying hearts gained from killing some enemies. There is a score system which serves no purpose other than for players to attempt to achieve high scores. Killing enemies and collecting collectibles are the main methods of gaining points but they can also be gained from a variety of methods depending on the level. For example walking on the piano in the music world both plays a tune, and gives the player some points.[CR][B]Worlds:[/B][CR]There are 7 different worlds in Zool, each with varying environments, enemies, collectibles etc. Each world has three levels.Sweet World[CR]The sweet world is a candy based world full of yummy treats for Zool to collect and kill. Enemies include jellies, bees and even a Bertie Basset. There are spike pits and spike creatures on walls and chocolate rivers which slow down Zool's movement. Rafts float on the rivers which can be used to traverse the rivers without slowing of movement.Music World[CR]The music world is a world of music. Musical instruments can be the players friends or enemies. Walking Cymbals and Drums are among Zool's enemies, while points can be gained by making music from walking along a giant music keyboard.Fruit &amp; Veg World[CR]The Fruit &amp; Veg world is a giant garden, where fruit can both help and hinder Zool. Brussel sprouts, carrots and grapes are the enemies. Other fruits, along with chopped off carrot tops can be collected to gain points.Tool World[CR]Tool world is full of lethal tools. From hammers trying to hit him, to drills trying to drill him, Zool is not safe in this dangerous world. Greased platforms hinder his movement and makes him slide down drops.Toy World[CR]The toy world features many dangerous toy based enemies, from marbles to toy tanks.Fun Fair World[CR]The fun fair world is anything but fun for Zool. Lethal hammers and candy-floss are some of Zool's enemies in this world. There is even an arcade cabinet in the amusement arcades which allows the players to play Zool.Shoot 'em Up World[CR]The seventh world is hidden through the other levels, and takes a departure from the platforming gameplay, and is a space shooter.[CR][B]Music:[/B][CR]Zool has multiple options for the background music in the game. The option to turn the music off altogether exists, along with 4 unique music styles, Rave, Rock, Green and Funk.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>The sequel to Zool sees him take on the bad guys Mental Block and Krool across 15 levels.[CR]Zool 2 is a platform game where you control the titular "Ninja of the Nth Dimension" (or his girlfriend, Zooz, who can complete each level in a slightly different way) as he rampages through a variety of levels, collecting countless tasty treats, shooting any enemies that he encounters and finding bonuses (there's a variety of special power-ups Zool can find - for example, a bomb that follows him and can be blown up at any time to remove on-screen enemies, or a temporary invulnerability). New to the sequel is Zool's ability to scale walls and his new spinning attacks. [CR]On each level you have to collect a certain amount of the featured fruit within an allocated time limit, and then find the exit across the multi-directionally-scrolling levels. There are lots of hidden areas to see, including a bonus Breakout game starring Zool's pet 2-headed dog.</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]A siege on an enemy castle.[CR]Defender of the Crown is a Strategy game set in Medieval England. The player takes control over a young Saxon man (either Wilfred of Ivanhoe, Cedric of Rotherwood, Geoffrey Longsword or Wolfric the Wild) wishing to become the King of England after the previous King (King Richard) is murdered by a Norman traitor, and the crown has been stolen. After being recruited by Robin Hood to fight for the good of the country, the player starts out with only one castle and ten soldiers and must build up his force to take back the crown and avenge the king's death by fighting against several Norman factions.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The main gameplay revolves around a Risk-style board of England in which players defend their territories from the Norman Factions, and partake in ruthless conquest in a bid to take over their territories. Amassing larger bands of troops increases the players chances of success. Many territories contain enemy castles. Upon launching an attack on a castled territory, the player must lay siege to the enemy castle by firing boulders at the castle wall from a catapult. The player can also decide to raid enemy castles for loot, which he can then use to strengthen his forces.[CR]In addition to this primary gameplay, several side-missions exist, including:A Jousting Match.Rescuing captured princesses: The player will occasionally receive a message from a damsel in distress, asking to be rescued from an enemy castle. The player must raid the enemy castle, sword-fighting towards the princess at the top of the castle. Upon the successful rescue of the princess, the player's character will marry the princess. There is a brief scene in which the shadowy figures of the character and the princess are seen seductively approaching each other, and their shadows are seen passionately kissing.Jousting matches: Occasionally invitations to rival factions tournaments will be received, in which the character must engage their rivals in mounted jousting battles. The player must line up their lance with the centre of the opponent's shield in order to knock him off the horse. A monetary prize is granted to the winner, which can be used to benefit your military conquest. The hero can also hold his own jousting tournaments from time to time.[CR][B]Ending:[/B][CR]Upon successfully completing the game (by defeating all the Norman factions) it is revealed that it was in fact Robin Hood who stole the crown. He did this in order to provide the hero a platform to prove their worthiness to become the new king of England. Robin returns the crown to the hero who is crowned king, and everyone lives happily ever after.[CR]Platform Differences[CR]The Amiga Version.[CR]Defender of the Crown was released on many different platforms. The main differences between platforms were the huge graphical differences. The Amiga version boasted the most technically proficient graphics and was heavily praised as one of the best looking games in 1986. The ports to the NES and DOS were the least graphically desirable versions of the game due to the limitations of the hardware.The DOS Version.[CR]Some gameplay differences also existed. The original Amiga version was rushed due to financial constraints on the developers, so several planned features (most notably attacking options such as flaming projectiles for the catapults and disease-based attacks) were absent from the final product. These features were included in some of the later ports of the game, including the Atari ST version.[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]Defender of the Crown was branded as an "interactive movie" and described by developers as a homage to several classic Hollywood movies, specifically Ivanhoe &amp; Robin Hood.Five pages of the game's manual are dedicated to discussing the legend of Robin Hood and his historicity.At the time Defender of the Crown was the largest game ever released, taking up 1.5MB. For this reason, the tape version of the Commodore 64 release needed to be edited to remove several pictures, including pictures of Robin Hood at the start of the game.[CR]System Requirements (PC)[CR]MinimumOS : Windows XP SP3 / Vista / 7 / 8 / 10Processor : 1.8 GHz processorMemory : 512 MB RAM ( 1 GB RAM recommended)Graphics : 3D graphics card compatible with DirectX 7 (DirectX 9 recommended)Hard Drive : 12. 2 MB available space[CR]System Requirements (Mac)[CR]MinimumOS :OS X 10.7.0 or newerProcessor : Intel Core 2 Duo 2 GHz+ processorMemory : 512 MB RAMGraphics : 256 MB VRAMHard Drive : 12.2 MB available space[CR]</plot>

		<title_clean>The Homebrew Games - Great Giana Sisters</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The most popular story behind this game is that after the wild success of the Nintendo Entertainment System platformer Super Mario Bros., a small development team called Time Warp Productions offered to create a version of the game for the most popular home computer systems, such as the Commodore 64, but Nintendo was not interested in releasing Mario on anything other than the NES. Because they had already mostly finished creating the game to demonstrate their concept to Nintendo, Time Warp finished the project and replaced all the graphics with original ones, renaming the game The Great Giana Sisters. The game was released in 1987 for multiple platforms, and was very quickly withdrawn from shelves due to threats of legal action from Nintendo, due to the obvious similarities to their flagship title. These threats of legal action also lead the ZX Spectrum version of the game to be scrapped, despite nearing completion. Due to the short time the game was on shelves, legitimate copies of the game are extremely rare, and are prized by video game collectors.[CR]Sequel[CR]A successor named Giana 2 - Arthur and Martha was in development, however, it was never released, again due to legal actions from Nintendo (despite the fact that the game didn't have anything in common with Super Mario Bros. anymore). After changing the name of the game to Hard'n Heavy and a drastic graphical overhaul which included replacing all the sprites, it was finally released.[CR]Giana Reborn[CR]In 2005, the game was re-released for mobile phones. Nintendo licensed a heavily polished Nintendo DS remake/sequel of the game titled Giana Sisters DS, which was released in Europe on April 2009 and in Fall 2011 in North America. This version was also released on the iPhone and iPad in 2010.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Harlequin is a side-scrolling platformer created by The Warp Factory and published in 1992 by Gremlin Graphics. You play Harlequin, who upon returning to his homeland of Chimerica finds that its heart has broken into four pieces. Harlequin must find them and mend the heart in the clock tower which lies at the center of the world.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] consists of traveling across the landscape via running and jumping, while enemies are dispatched by spraying hearts at them. Many of the levels also feature puzzles which must be solved. The game is not linear in the typical platformer fashion; instead of running through a level from start to finish in order to proceed to the next, switches are scattered across the gameworld which open and close various paths between the game's levels. Careful exploration is required to figure out how to progress and where to go each time. Backtracking to previously visited levels is also sometimes vital.[CR]One of the game's more interesting features is a big level dedicated to parodying the Super Mario Bros. games, filled with objects that smile at the player and look eerily out of place when compared to some of the other levels.[CR][B]Reception:[/B][CR]The game received rave reviews from enthusiast magazines at the time of release, but the lackluster sales prevented it from ever getting a sequel.[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]Harlequin's music was composed by Barry Leitch.[CR]</plot>

		<title_clean>Homebrew Games - Heart of China</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR]Heart of China is one of two predominant point and click adventure games published by Dynamix, an offshoot of the Sierra family of companies.  Like its sister project Rise of the Dragon, it is a point and click adventure game, with a few action elements interspersed at key moments, alongside a fascination with broadly-drawn characters from the Orient.Players take on the role of a character similar to those found in many high adventure pulp novels, whose task it is to save a lovely nurse who is kidnapped at the start of the game.  At certain points AFTER player decisions, a symbol denoting a crossroads sign will appear.  This tells the player that if they had chosen differently, there would be different consequences to their actions.  This allowed for multiple endings, but at the same time if you didn't save frequently, you might be forced to replay a good portion of the game in order to see where the other branch led should you be blindsided with the choice and its consequences.Action sequences included melee combat atop a speeding train, as well as trying to drive a tank away from the villains' fortress without crashing it, while defending you and your companions from hostile forces.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>The central theme of the pinball game Pinball Prelude is time. The first table is set in the past and features a dinosaur setting, with table elements being not easily recognizable as such since they blend into the environment. The second table is set in the present and at the same time the most conventional of the three design-wise. The third table plays in the future and contains five flippers in total.[CR]Some of the features include a hi-res mode for multi-ball, vertical and horizontal scrolling of the playfield and a rubber ball, which behaves much differently than the standard steel sphere.</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]We follow Puggsy who has crash landed on an alien planet 15 light years away from his home planet. The inhabitants of the planet have stolen his spaceship which stops him from being able to find his way home.[CR]You find your way through many levels where there is no set path and you can find your own way around, with the main objective of getting your spaceship back from 'The Racoons'[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Puggsy is a platformer, which means it works pretty much in the same way as others: Up, Down, Left, Right, Pick up, Put down, Throw. However, many of the levels involve puzzles which are required in order to progress.[CR]Puggsy uses Total Object Interaction which is the system that allows real world physics to come into play. Certain objects in the game can be picked up and used in some way to help you complete the level. You can even stack objects, such as barrels to help you reach the higher platforms. You can also throw these objects at the enemies, or even pick up a gun and shoot them. Also, the object you carry will make you weigh more, so you wont be able to jump as high depending on your weight. Each object has a different weight to it, from a balloon that will help you float to a weight that will sink you quickly.[CR]The goal of each level is to reach the exit. Optionally, you may bring items with you through the exit door to give you more points. Often times levels will involve finding a key and unlocking a chest to reach the most valuable item to take back with you. If you're crafty, you can bring multiple things in the doorway with you, netting you those precious extra points. You can also replay any levels that you like, which is helpful if you need points or a pair of sunglasses or trainers for Puggsy.[CR]Special Items[CR]Sunglasses - Not only used to look awesome, they act as a shield for one hit.[CR]Shield - Makes you temporarily invincible when activated.[CR]Trainers - When worn, provides a speed and jump height boost.

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Pushover is a puzzle platformer that was sponsored by the British potato-based snack called Quavers. The gist of the story is that the Quavers mascot, a character named Colin Curly, has lost his packets of Quavers down an ant hill. The SNES version saw Colin Curly being changed to Captain Rat and the Quavers replaced by bundles of cash. The game was originally designed before the Quavers brand was tacked on, and received some good reviews.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The player controls an ant called G.I. Ant, who has to return Colin's favorite snack by pushing over a number of dominoes. The object is to knock over a key domino that will open up a door to the next level. This is done by picking up and move dominoes around the screen, arranging them, and utilizing their special abilities (see below). The player is only able to push one domino, so the sequence must be planned out in advance.[CR]There are many ways in which levels can be made unwinnable; for one thing, there is a time limit for each of the 100 levels and if this runs out the player is able to continue with the level but is unable to move onto the next. All the dominoes must also be knocked over to complete the level, and G.I. Ant must be able to get to the exit door. G.I. Ant himself can also die, either by falling from a great height, falling through the gaps at the bottom of the screen or the death from above i.e. a domino falling on top of him.[CR]There are 9 different themes that the levels are based on: a castle, a dungeon, an Aztec temple, the inside of a PC, a space station, a factory/industrial theme, a Meccano based world, a Japanese house, and a Greek building. After every 10 levels, there is a cutscene of G.I. Ant handing a very grateful Colin his bag of Quavers.Domino Types[CR]Standard - Basic type of domino.[CR]Stopper - Dominoes that don't topple over and rebounds any other types of dominoes that fall against them.[CR]Delay - Standard domino that wobbles for a short time before falling over. In that time they act like a Stopper. [CR]Ascender - Dominoes that can fly upwards.[CR]Bridger - This domino can bridge gaps of one space, and another domino can be placed on top.[CR]Exploder - This type is opposite of the Bridger dominoes and will explode, creating a gap in the ledge. The resulting explosion may damage ladders.[CR]Vanisher - These dominoes vanish once they land.[CR]Splitter - The Splitter domino divides into two separate dominoes when it is hit.[CR]Tumbler - The tumbler domino can fall over edges. Once it falls, it pops back up and continues to flip along.[CR]Trigger - The final domino that must fall to finish the level.[CR] [CR]</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Puzznic is a puzzle game that was originally released for Arcade by Taito in 1989. It is similar to Taito's earlier game Flipull/Plotting and involves carefully matching gems of the same color to remove them from the board until it has been completely cleared.[CR]Puzznic would be ported to a large number of home computers and consoles both in and outside of Japan shortly after its initial release.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The player has to manage gem blocks which fall to the bottom of the screen when unsupported. Gems disappear when one or more gems of the same color are touching them; however, if a single gem of a specific color is left behind, the puzzle becomes impossible to complete. The same is true when two or more gems cannot reach each other due to obstructions.[CR]In this sense, the game is deeply strategic in the same manner as a game like Sokoban where the player always needs to consider their next few moves.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]RoboCop is a licensed sci-fi side-scrolling shooter based on the 1987 movie about the titular cop cyborg. It loosely follows the events of the movie, pitting RoboCop against gun-toting criminals and the ED-209 bipedal robot.[CR]The original Arcade game was developed by Data East (though some sources also say Nihon Bussan) in 1988 and ported to numerous home computers in the US and Europe. Most of the European releases were handled by Ocean Software. Japanese developer SAS Sakata developed the 1989 NES port. The Commodore 64 and Game Boy versions of the game are subtly different from the rest, featuring a different plot unrelated to the movie, but still contains similar gameplay. Music from the Game Boy game, composed by Jonathon Dunn and based on the C64 soundtrack, was used in an European TV advert for the kitchen appliance company Ariston.[CR]Data East and Ocean Software would go on to produce sequels that looked and played similarly, based on the movies RoboCop 2 and RoboCop 3 and the 1992 Dark Horse comic book series RoboCop Versus The Terminator.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Title screen of the C64 home version[CR]Rodland was originally released for the Arcades by Jaleco, but was made for several other home systems and computers. The Arcade version differs greatly from the home versions because it features improved graphics and many more levels.[CR]The Arcade also essentially featured a sequel of Rod Land upon completion of the game with stronger enemies and a new story. The home consoles and computers never received a version of Rod Land that featured this sequel mode.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]Tam and Rit holding the Rods of Sheesanomo[CR]Fairies Tam and Rit find out that their mother has been kidnapped by evil monsters. They are each granted with magical wands, called the Rods of Sheesanomo, that give them powers. With their new powers they can defeat the monsters and rescue their kidnapped mother.[CR] [CR] [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] resembles many platformers of the time[CR]Rodland is an action platformer where one or two players take the role of fairies Tam and Rit. Each level is featured entirely on one screen, and the levels are populated with monsters. The goal is to simply to defeat all the enemies on screen using tricks and the magic wands. The magic wands can only stun the monsters, but once they are stunned they can be defeated by slamming them into the floor with the wand's power. The fairies navigate levels by running along multiple platforms that are connected by ladders. There are ladders in each level, but the player can also create ladders. Every time a new ladder is created the previous one disappears which provides opportunities to dispose of enemies. Enemies drop types of "tricks", usually explosives, when defeated which can then be used to defeat other enemies.[CR]Should the player collect every flower on the level, the enemies transform into faster "peach" enemies that will drop letters when eliminated. By spelling out EXTRA with these letters, the player can earn additional lives. It behooves the player to leave enemies alive so that they can be transformed for EXTRA letters and bonus lives, though this in turn makes it harder to navigate the level.Bonus Levels[CR]The Arcade version featured a sequel with a new story, levels and visuals, but the gameplay stayed largely the same. In the sequel the player still controls Tam and Rit, but this time they are out to avenge their father's death. Tam and Rit travel through a pyramid where the enemy that killed their father rests. Throughout the game they are guided by the ghost of their father for help in the game.[CR]</plot>

		<title_clean>Homebrew Games - Super Street Fighter II - The New Challengers</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Super Street Fighter II: The New Challengers is the fourth iteration of Capcom's genre-defining Street Fighter II originally released in the Arcades in 1993 on Capcom's new CP System II board. It follows Champion Edition (which first allowed players to play as the four Grand Masters Sagat, Balrog, Vega and M. Bison) and Turbo: Hyper Fighting (which increased the speed and balanced the game further). The most notable addition are four brand new characters: Cammy, Deejay, T.Hawk and Fei Long. It would eventually be followed by Super Street Fighter II Turbo Edition, considered the definitive Super Street Fighter II.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]This remake of  Street Fighter II featured a new scoring system that kept track of combos, first attacks, and reversals. Additionally, four new characters join the returning twelve characters from the original. Super Street Fighter II is also the first game in the SFII series to give full move sets to the boss characters. Previously in Street Fighter II: Champion Edition and Street Fighter II: Turbo, whilst the four boss characters were available, they did not have different animations for some punches and kicks. Although this was expected for Balrog (being a boxer), it was unusual to see a character doing a punch when pressing a kick button, or vice-versa.[CR]Aside from the bosses' added moves, some of the main characters' moves were adjusted in some ways. For example, the differences between Ken and Ryu became more defined - Ryu focusing on deadlier fireballs, and Ken's fierce Dragon Punch being able to set opponents on fire.[CR]Criticism[CR]For all the additions and improvements Super Street Fighter II makes over  Street Fighter II: Turbo, its biggest failing is arguably that it does not include the same degree of speed that made Street Fighter II: Turbo such a hit. It is perhaps for this very reason that, in most cases, this game is overlooked in preference to its follow-up -  Super Street Fighter II: Turbo.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Returning charactersSSFII featured four new characters Ryu Ken Masters E.
