		<emu_comment>The Atari 2600, or Atari VCS before 1982, is a home video game console released on September 11, 1977 by Atari, Inc. It is credited with popularizing the use of microprocessor-based hardware and ROM cartridges containing game code, a format first used with the Fairchild Channel F game console.[CR]The console was originally sold as the Atari VCS, which stood for Video Computer System. Following the release of the Atari 5200 in 1982, the VCS was renamed to the "Atari 2600", after the unit's Atari part number, CX2600. The 2600 was typically bundled with two joystick controllers, a conjoined pair of paddle controllers, and a game cartridge, initially Combat, and later Pac-Man.[CR]Developer:  Atari[CR]Manufacturer:  Atari[CR]CPU:  MOS Technology 6507[CR]Memory:  128 bytes RAM[CR]Graphics:  128-color palette[CR]Sound:  Television Interface Adaptor[CR]Media:  Cartridge[CR]Max.

        <plot>PEACE THROUGH SUPERIOR FIREPOWER! [CR]In the far future, the planet is overrun with enormous, super insects, who fiercely battle each other for survival. You've chosen a side to fight for, and the enemy has been funneled into a deep crevice, but now you're outnumbered. You put their numbers to the test. They say the meek shall inherit the Earth, but how long can you defend it?[CR]This was originally planned to be 1 of 3 "3-D" games on Power-Play Arcade cart #1. A screenshot was shown in a catalog for Amiga's Power System, but no description was included. It was programmed by Dan McElroy and Jerry Lawson in 1983, shelved, and made available for limited release in 2010.</plot>

        <plot>Open, Sesame! is an action platform game. You control Ali Baba, and your goal is to reach the cave of treasures. The treasury entrance is at the top of the screen, and you begin each level at the bottom and need to climb your way up. To do so, you will need to find a good location where you can throw a rope up to the next platform and climb up (there will be a dot on the platform where you can safely throw a rope, two on each floor). Before the treasury can be entered, you need to attach ropes to each of the possible locations. To hinder your progress, there are guards wandering each of the floors. If you're caught, you'll lose a life! To help out, a magic ball will appear on screen from time to time; if caught, this can be used to temporarily freeze a guard. When you successfully enter the treasury, you then move on to the next level of gameplay.[CR]Other versions with a different title:[CR]Apples and Dolls[CR]Apriti, Sesamo[CR]I Want My Mommy[CR]Open Sesame [CR]Open Sesane[CR]Open, Sesame! - Abre-te, Sesamo![CR]Open, Sesame! - Sesam, Öffne Dich[CR]Sesam Öffne Dich [CR]Sesam, Öffne Dich / Open, Sesame![CR]Teddy Apple[CR]Teddy Perdido</plot>

        <plot>The player is trapped in a crashed nuclear submarine which has begun taking on water. They need to escape by making their way up the levels of the submarine one at a time. Each floor has two hatch keys that need to be collected in order to unlock the elevator to the next level. There is a time limit, though; if you take too long the floor will flood and you'll be unable to escape. Due to the crash, the torpedoes on board the submarine are now loose and wander across the floor as the boat shakes. The player will need to jump over any torpedoes that cross their path, or they will be stunned momentarily and lose precious time.</plot>

        <plot>Ever since you left that last planet, you've been bothered by eerie sounds coming from somewhere in the hull of Nostromo, your giant transport cruiser. After setting the ship's controls on autopilot, you descend to have a look. Yow! Every hallway in the entire maze-like hull has been lined with the grotesque eggs of some gruesome space creature.

        <plot>Ever since you left that last planet, you've been bothered by eerie sounds coming from somewhere in the hull of Nostromo, your giant transport cruiser. After setting the ship's controls on autopilot, you descend to have a look. Yow! Every hallway in the entire maze-like hull has been lined with the grotesque eggs of some gruesome space creature. Quickly you sprint down the corridor crushing the eggs as you go. Then you see it! A hideous being with jaws like a beartrap. You run away from this brutal beast, not wishing to end up as an intergalactic snack. You turn a corner and stare unbelievingly. Another Alien is just ahead. Don't bother calling for help.

Tanks move fast on roads, slower through trees, slowest through water. Simulated battle sounds and visuals - 'cannon' fire, tanks 'explode' after three direct hits, and more!</plot>

        <plot>A mothership drops aliens, up to three on screen at a time. There are ten per level. You must shoot them but avoid the items they fire at you. You fire by pushing up on the joystick. Pushing left or right makes you go left or right. If you hold down the button, pushing left or right makes you fire left or right.[CR]Later enemies will drop fireballs that chase you along the ground or split in two smaller enemies when shot. If you fire non-stop, you will build up heat as indicated by the green bar at the bottom right.[CR]If you overheat or are hit by an enemy, you loser a life. The game is over when you lose all lives or reach a score of 999,999. You get a new man (4 max) every 10,000 points.</plot>

        <plot>The lost city of Atlantis is under attack! Wave after wave of Gorgon vessels are approaching, each armed with weapons capable of destroying a part of the city. You are in charge of the command posts at the edges of the city and need to defend it from the invaders. The various Gorgon craft will keep flying by on the screen in varying numbers and in different flight patterns. At first they fly high in the sky but then progressively lower. If an enemy makes it low enough before you destroy it, it will use it's weapons and destroy one of the buildings in Atlantis. As you progress in the game, the enemy craft will keep increasing in speed. The game ends when all remaining buildings in the city have been destroyed.[CR]Sounds familiar? It should. Atlantis II is an altered version of Atlantis When Imagic ran the Defend Atlantis contest, they wanted to find the top four highest-scoring players and invite them to Bermuda for a grand finale shoot-out for cash prizes. The top two-hundred fifty contestants would get snorkeling sets and the top one-thousand contestants would get t-shirts. Unfortunately, more than four people maxed out the score on Atlantis so, to break this tie, all of these maxed-out scorers were sent snorkeling sets and t-shirts as well as a modified Atlantis game called Atlantis II. The modified game is faster, scores lower per hit and the score font is different.</plot>

But remember, someone else has the same goal...</plot>

        <plot>This isn't kid stuff! It's the fastest, flyingest, most unforgiving trio of events any biker could ask for. Start with a Half Pipe that takes you so high you won't know whether you're coming or going. Then do a Quarter Pipe that makes doing dozens of tricks easy and crashing even easier. Then try the Ramp Jump. It's the jump that's just a bit wider than the Grand Canyon. If there's a more dangerous challenge open to daredevil BMX bikers, we have yet to test it. So, if you think you're good - really good - put your freewheeling skills on the line with BMX AirMaster!</plot>

        <plot>Hi there, handsome. It seems a dream, but it's all too true; it's a swingin' bachelor blowout - all for you! So come on in, now don't be shy and get warmed up with Senor Spanish Fly. We're ready, willin', and if you're able, you can make a score to inspire song and fable. The strategy against defeat, is to start off slow and sweet; and do remember, if you can, it's not the clothes that make the man. You'll soon be needing all your strength and speed to prove your worth and do the deed!</plot>

        <plot>Rescue a damsel in distress from being burned alive by moving around in your helicopter and putting out the flame with your fire hose. Meanwhile, avoid the rocks being thrown at you by the bad dudes. When you've nearly extinguished the flames, the woman will begin jumping up and down. If you swoop down, she'll latch on to your "joystick" with her mouth, and you can fly her off to safety before the flames move in on her. If you save her, you will be rewarded with a dirty little animation. The male and female roles of this game are switched in Jungle Fever.[CR]Bachelorette Party is an "x-rated" version of Breakout. Move the Spanish fly so that the woman comes in contact with it. She will then ricochet toward the men and "score" with each one she touches. She will then bounce back toward the fly. If you miss her, you lose a turn. The fun part is watching the men's willies go up and down as she flies toward them. The roles of the men and women are switched in Bachelor Party.</plot>

        <plot>You are a flying saucer trying to destroy cities below. You can move any direction and to fire, just hold the button and push that way. The cities will fire missiles at you to stop you. In later levels, the missiles turn into balloon bombs that you mustn't run into and later levels, the balloon bombs turn into horizontally travelling missiles if you are level with the balloon.[CR]There are four game variations. Games one and two are one or two player, respectively, at a beginner level. Games three and four are one or two player, respectively, at advanced level.[CR]You advance to the next level when all the cities of that level are destroyed. The game ends if you reach 999,999 points or lose all of your ships.</plot>

        <plot>You are a local leading-lady and all the uptown boys are standing in line for a date, but a savvy soda-slinger just around the corner is more down your alley and you just can't seem to get enough of his famous fountain treats. Most evenings the joint's a jumpin', the city's clamoring for that counter-Casanova's premium hand-packed ice cream, and to prove you are the only girl in town who can make his soda pop, you will have to apply yourself to matters at hand and stay one jump ahead of the crowd. Demonstrate your heart is in the right place (at the right time) and you will be certain to get all that's comin' to you.</plot>

        <plot>You are a local leading-lady and all the uptown boys are standing in line for a date, but a savvy soda-slinger just around the corner is more down your alley and you just can't seem to get enough of his famous fountain treats. Most evenings the joint's a jumpin', the city's clamoring for that counter-Casanova's premium hand-packed ice cream, and to prove you are the only girl in town who can make his soda pop, you will have to apply yourself to matters at hand and stay one jump ahead of the crowd. Demonstrate your heart is in the right place (at the right time) and you will be certain to get all that's comin' to you.</plot>

        <plot>Bionic Breakthrough was one of only two games written to be used with the MindLink controller, a headband that the player wore on his head and plugged into the joystick port. The idea was that the MindLink's sensors would pick up any facial movements or muscle twitches the player would make. The problem was that the MindLink didn't work very well in initial test runs, and even when it did worked players would complain of headaches and dizziness from twitching their face. Bionic Breakthrough is really just Super Breakout with a title screen. It's unknown if this was just supposed to be a demo to show what the MindLink could do, or if it was actually a standalone product. Before the game starts there is a screen where the word MindLink slowly scrolls to the bottom, this is for callibration. On this screen the player can move the text block left and right to make sure the Mindlink is working properly. Bionic Breakthrough was never released.</plot>

        <plot>Players control Bobby as he tries to make his way home. Bobby has to jump over various obstacles laying in his path such as rocks, ponds, fountains, and broken bridges and also has to be careful not to collide with several animals that can get in his way such as hawks, chickens, butterflies, and bats. The game consists of seven screens of these obstacles with the eighth screen being obstacle free as it just involves simply walking Bobby forward into his house. Bobby starts with five lives on his journey home. He also starts with 3,000 points and will gain a 1,000 more for each screen he clears or for each time he loses a life. The score will constantly decrease so its ideal for the player to reach Bobby's house as fast as possible so they can rack up a high score.</plot>

        <plot>Boggle is an unreleased game for the Atari 2600 programmed by David Crane while he was still working at Atari. In Boggle, which is based on the popular word game of the same name, you must form as many words as possible from a random 4x4 grid of letters. The 2600 version of the game is for two players only, and each player can form a maximum of eight words (likely due to memory constraints of the 2600). The game appears to be fairly close to completion, although there are some glitches, such as all the letters not appearing in the grid right away when you start the game. Still, it's an interesting prototype and it's unknown why Boggle was not completed and released.</plot>

In fact, it's raining bunnies![CR]What's a crazy monkey to do? Get help, that's what! Coco and his brother Haggis are out to catch the bunnies and bounce 'em to safety. It's monkey business, for sure, and they need your help, so grab that trampoline, and start Bouncin' Baby Bunnies!![CR]A copy of the nearly complete game surfaced in the collection of a former Telesys employee in 2007. According to programmer Alex Leavens, Bouncin' Baby Bunnies is based off the old Bugs Bunny cartoon, where the stork mistakenly delivers Bugs to a gorilla family and they think he's their baby. The only known prototype of Bouncin' Baby Bunnies seems to be fairly complete, but still needs some tweaks and bug fixes. The game didn't get released because of the collapsing game market of 83/84. According to the former Telesys employee: 'Bouncin' Baby Bunnies came too late in the 2600 cycle and, at the time, wasn't worth releasing. The market was saturated.'</plot>

        <plot>Boxing shows a top-down view of two boxers, one white and one black. When close enough, a boxer can hit his opponent with a punch (executed by pressing the fire button on the Atari joystick). This causes his opponent to reel back slightly. Long punches score one point, while closer punches (power punches, from the manual) score two. There are no knockdowns or rounds. A match is completed either when one player lands 100 punches (a "knockout") or two minutes have elapsed (a "decision"). In the case of a decision, the player with the most landed punches is the winner. Ties are possible.[CR]While the gameplay is simple, there are subtleties, such as getting an opponent on the "ropes" and "juggling" him back and forth between alternate punches.</plot>

        <plot>Ahh Cabbage Patch Kids. Who could forget those chubby little dolls that started fist fights between middle aged housewives in toy stores? For some reason every kid had to have one of these creepy little kewpie dolls back in the 80's, although the fad eventually faded. Since Cabbage Patch Kids just happened to be manufactured by Coleco, it was only natural that they would create a video game tie in. While the Colecovision version of Cabbage Patch Kids was released to much success, the Atari 2600 version never materialized.[CR]If you're scratching your head as to how someone could create a game based on a line of dolls, you're not alone. Dolls don't exactly inspire video games. However Coleco got around this by taking an existing game for the MSX line of computers called Athletic Land and adding the Cabbage Patch Kids into the game. Since the MSX computer was never released in the US, people were none the wiser. This is also why a game that was supposedly aimed at children seems so damn hard.[CR]Cabbage Patch Kids: Adventures in the Park (which will be henceforth referred to as CPK) is a side scrolling action game. According to the Colecovision version's manual, Anna Lee has decided to go out for some exercise in the local park and is soon caught up in a wild adventure (hence the subtitle Adventures in the Park). The game is separated into several different screens (referred to in the game as scenes), each with a different obstacle for your kid to overcome. Obstacles include bouncing balls, water filled pits, floating platforms, bees, and even fires. Each level consists of ten scenes which must all be overcome before the time limit runs out. Along the way Anna may also collect various objects hidden in the trees (using well placed trampolines) for points, but these objects are not necessary to win.[CR]CPK was known to exist for some time thanks to an interview conducted with another former Coleco programmer Ed English several years ago. Ed was thought to be in possession of the only known prototype, but he would not release it for unknown reasons. However in 2008 several Coleco EPROMs were found in a flea market, several of which contained various versions of CPK. These EPROMs were released to the public shortly afterwards.[CR]While it may not be able to compare graphically to the Colecovision version, the Atari 2600 version of CPK is an amazing feat of programming. Not only was all the gameplay retained in this conversion, but it even included a cute little background tune which was a rarity in 2600 games. It appears that CPK was simply a victim of the collapsing game market, and by the time the final version was ready in September of 1984, Coleco had stopped its 2600 operations.</plot>

        <plot>You must catch pastries from six conveyor belts before they fall on the floor. Each pastry caught is boxed and put behind you. Sometimes, a knife and fork come down the conveyor belt. If you are hit by the utensils or miss a pastry, the janitor has to clean it up. If he has to clean up too many times, he gets upset and storms out and game over.[CR]You can push the button to stop a conveyor belt for about four seconds but if you stop a second one, the first belt starts right back up. On games with belt speed up, you can push right on the joystick to speed up the belt you are in front of.[CR]At the end of each level, you will have a cup of coffee come down the belt, but not fall off the end. When you grab the cup, you get and extra clean-up (life) and the next level begins.[CR]Difficulty switches[CR]Set the left switch to A to start at level five. Set to B to start at level one. The right switch is not used.[CR]The are game variations that force the baker to pause when transferring boxes, making it harder, variations that allow belt speedup, variations with fast moving bakers and variations with all gingerbread men.</plot>

        <plot>The conveyors are spinning out of control! A torrent of cakes and pies pours from the ovens. The besieged Baker must snatch the pastries before they fall off the end, but avoid the deadly silverware. If that's not enough, there's a dancing gingerbread man that tries to out-fox the Baker and a surly janitor to sweep up the mistakes. Good reflexes alone aren't enough to avoid disaster. As the pace increases, planning time and margin of error vanish until the bad-tempered janitor won't clean up another spill. Can you catch all the pastries and keep the Bakery going until the next coffee break? Test your speed, skill, and decisiveness in CAKEWALK, the latest video challenge from CommaVid.</plot>

        <plot>The game concept in Care Bears revolves around grabbing the "Tummy Icon" from each of the Care Bears as they slowly fell down the screen. Once all the icons were collected the player would have to arrange them in a certain order before time ran out. Although this may sound rather easy, one has to keep in mind that the game was geared toward young children, so things had to be kept simplistic.[CR]Care Bears made it to the beta testing stage before the marketing department decided to stop work on the game citing that the market for childrens games was diminishing, and the gameplay was too dull. Therefore it was decided that all further development on the game was to be stopped. According to programmer Laura Nikolich, part of the reason Care Bears was killed off, was that the marketing department really didn't know what they wanted. The Care Bears product line was aimed at the 8 and under age group, but marketing wanted a more action oriented game designed for older kids. Although Nikolich described the game as being almost finished, the only known prototype to surface is nothing more than a graphics demo.</plot>

While it was never commercially released by UA Ltd., it did appear on a European multi-cart under the name Cat N Mouse. It's unknown why this game (and the other UA prototypes) were never released commercially.[CR]Cat Trax is available in cartridge form from the AtariAge Store and includes a professionally printed box, manual and label, with artwork created by Dave Exton.</plot>

        <plot>This is a doubled-ended cartridge with Philly Flasher on one end and Cathouse Blues on the other.[CR]Philly Flasher is a graphically altered version of Beat 'Em and Eat 'Em with guys (or a guy) doing the catching and what they are catching looks to be milk from a witch's tit. The game plays just like Beat 'Em and Eat 'Em otherwise except the guy(s) masturbate after each round.[CR]In Cathouse Blues, you are a horny guy who has to memorize which 7 houses the ladies of ill repute wander into. Grab some cash from the teller, and visit each woman. A visit will cost $20, at which time you'll find yourself in her bed. Score with her as many times as you can before you're forced to leave for the next. The cops are in pursuit as well as a mugger who wants your money. Visiting a wrong house will cause you to be temporarily immobilized (a sitting duck for the cops) as you figure out what to do next. The roles of the men and women are switched in Gigolo.</plot>

You'll find family and friends ganging up on the computer to try to beat him. It's challenging, thrilling, and hours of fun!</plot>

        <plot>You're piloting a helicopter gunship, flying cover for a truck convoy of medical supplies through enemy territory. Suddenly, your long-range scanner shows squadrons of enemy aircraft closing in on your position. You throw the control stick forward and your chopper shoots skyward, barely avoiding a cluster of multi-warhead missiles. Your response is swift, as you pivot your gunship 180 degrees, unleashing a lightning barrage of laser rockets. The action: furious. The concentration: intense. You are engaged in one of the most demanding video battles ever conceived. You must rely on your long-range scanner, your wits, and your reflexes. Because it's your responsibility to see that those supplies get through. So, take charge - you're at the controls, with Chopper Command, by Activision!</plot>

        <plot>The year is 2037. Mankind has finally tired of fighting massive wars with millions senselessly slaughtered. All this has been replaced by a new kind of warfare: the Combat Duels. Any time diplomacy between two nations fails, they resolve the conflict via the Duels, where two individuals battle head-to-head for their country's honor. These individuals are called Combatants, and they've trained hard and fought thousands of test duels to earn the right to be the champions for their nations. Combat Two will put you in the role of such a Combatant, a mighty hero of the virtual battlefield. Prove to your country that you are worthy of fighting in the Combat Duels and lead them to victory!</plot>

        <plot>Early, unreleased version of Video Chess. Video Chess is the game that led Atari to first invent bank-switched ROMs for the Atari 2600, even though the shipping version of the game wouldn't use the technique and was only 4K in size.[CR]This is an early home chess game. The standard U. S. chess rules are used in this game. To move a piece, place the X on the board onto the piece to be moved then press the red button. Next, move the X to where you want the piece to go and press the button again. If the move is illegal, the 2600 will give a warning sound and not make the move.[CR]To castle your king, the king and rook must not have been moved. You move your king two squares in the direction of the rook to castle with. The 2600 will then automatically move your rook around your king, completing the move. You cannot castle out of check and you cannot castle to the king's side if any squares between the king and rook are threatened.[CR]Another maneuver is called en passant. This move is used to counteract the enemy pawn's initial double move on a adjacent square. To carry out the en passant, you must advance your pawn to the fifth rank. Your opponent then has the option of moving his or her pawn one square (where it would be under attack) or two squares. If you opponent elects to move two squares, the en passant move allows you to take that pawn by diagonally moving your pawn to the square that was skipped over.[CR]Skill levels[CR]These determine how long the computer will think on its move. These times are approximate and may vary slightly, depending on what move you did.[CR]Level 1=15 seconds[CR]Level 2=30 seconds[CR]Level 3=45 seconds[CR]Level 4=2 minutes, 45 seconds[CR]Level 5=3 minutes, 15 seconds[CR]Level 6=12 minutes[CR]Level 7=10 hours[CR]Level 8=10 seconds[CR]Level 8 is a beginner level.</plot>

        <plot>Confrontation is a strange strategy game which was never commercially released, but was available directly from Answer for a short time. Only people who saw it on display at the 1983 CES show would have know about it and ordered it so while it's not technically a prototype, it's close enough. I've racked my brain on how to best describe the gameplay of this game, and after much searching I've determined the best description is in Leonard Herman's "ABC's to the VCS" (pick up a copy today!). Since Confrontation uses a programming trick to display so many objects on the screen at once, screenshots will only show one players pieces at a time. Take my word for it, they're really all there.</plot>

        <plot>The immense WAYPOINT interstellar trade depot floats with its tiny crew at a distant crossroads between the stars. It should be a quiet place to command. But beware -- a dormant colony of giant, alien, mineral-eating termites hidden in ore holding section seven have awakened! The Termites invade the main power-conversion chamber and begin assembling a haphazard nest. Your crew is working feverishly, opening the crates of tiny remote-controlled planetary-probe ships. It's up to you to pilot a fragile probe ship into the power chamber and clear out the invaders before they jam it totally. By docking with your refueling ship when necessary, and by energizing the nest blocks so your probe ship's fire can destroy them, you may be able to prevail against the invaders and save WAYPOINT.</plot>

        <plot>This game was developed concurrently for the Atari 2600 and 7800, but only the 7800 version was released. The 2600 version only has three levels as opposed to six on the 7800, but those three levels are well utilized considering the limitations of the 2600.[CR]As an Ornithologist, you must protect the eggs of the South American Hornbill that are nested in your tree. Various predators attempt to steal the eggs from under your nose. Using your slingshot, you must defend the eggs until the timer runs out. If a predator steals an egg you still have a chance to save it, but you risk losing other eggs from the tree while you are distracted.[CR]Next you must protect the Hornbills that have chosen to nest in the sewers, where the gameplay is the same as the tree level. Finally you move onto a bonus round at the Rooster Ranch, here you must shoot roosters that pop out of windows.[CR]This version of Crack'ed was released at the 2002 Classic Gaming Expo, complete with a unique label, box and instructions.</plot>

Let six of the buggers in, and you've had it. C'mon. Show 'em you're madder than mad, and you're not gonna take it anymore. Get yourself up to the roof to pelt these pests with petunias. This swarm is just itching to eat you out of house and home...</plot>

Move the tiles on the big square (5x5) one at a time, and try to form the pattern shown on one of the little squares (3x3) within the middle 9 tiles of the big square. The game is set up with two big squares for grueling two-player competition.[CR]Cubicolor was designed by Rob Fulop of Imagic fame. Supposedly, only 50 were produced, and each cartridge is numbered. The rarity and legend of this game make it potentially the most sought-after 2600 game in existence.</plot>

        <plot>Planned as a pack-in cassette title for Amiga's never released Power Module peripheral and described as 'the first machine-interactive video game', offering head-to-head play, with one player the submarine commander and the other the destroyer captain. Each player would have had their own screen display and set of commands. The Power Module was dropped in favor of the Power Play Arcade carts, and the game’s development only went as far as this version. Catalog description: 'You know he's down there. But where? Your sonar is picking up indiscriminate blips. Then a pattern emerges. You've found him. You launch a round of depth charges over the side, and the explosions rock the ship. You smile confidently and check the scanner: completely blank. Suddenly, there's a blip. And another. Or... You know he's up there. But where...'[CR]The cart, box and manual are reproductions from 2010 with permission of Jerry Lawson.</plot>

        <plot>Desert Falcon is an arcade style shooter. Many of the Pharaoh's great treasures are lost throughout the desert, and your goal is to steal as many as you can to earn points. The game features a scrolling, isometric point of view as you control your falcon through the various desert landscapes. The treasures you are after are guarded of course. Many desert creatures including vultures, warriors, flying fish, sphinxes and more will all attempt to stop you from succeeding in your task. Also, at the end of each level you will need to face a large, howling sphinx before you can continue on. Your falcon isn't completely unarmed, and has the ability to fire darts which can be used to destroy the assorted enemies and the sphinx. In the sand, you will occasionally come across some hieroglyphs. Several different superpowers can be gained by landing and hopping over three of these hieroglyphs. Depending on which hieroglyphs are collected, you may become invincible, warp to the end of the level, earn free points, trick enemies into attacking a decoy instead of you, or even get an air bomb which destroys all airborne enemies.</plot>

        <plot>Donald has entered the Duckburg boat race and has taken to the sea with his speedboat. The objective is to steer the boat away from the obstacles along the way to the finish line and do so as fast as possible without losing pressure on the throttle. The game takes place across multiple screens which each presents its own obstacle patterns and challenges.[CR]Donald Duck's Speedboat was ready for release before being cancelled for reasons unknown. It was cancelled so late in fact that a prototype box and several screenshots had already been shown in European Atari 2600 catalogs. Speculation is that the Children's line-up wasn't selling as well as Atari had hoped, and they pulled the plug on the whole operation.</plot>

        <plot>Remember in Donkey Kong how Mario fought Papa Donkey Kong? Well, Mario won. Now he has Papa locked up like an animal in a cage. Only you, Donkey Kong Junior, can save Papa. You have to reach a special key to unlock the cage. But Mario has other ideas. As you nimbly climb trees and gracefully swing across vines towards your goal, Mario sends jaw-snapping creatures after you. You earn extra points by plucking fruit to bonk them. When you have won your first challenge, another scene appears with even greater obstacles. And the third level is the most difficult of all. You can do it! After all, you're a chimp off the old block!</plot>

        <plot>Dukes of Hazzard is a driving game with an overhead perspective, based on the popular television series of the same name. Players take on the role of the Duke boys driving the infamous "General Lee," while trying to avoid the police and rescue their sister Daisy from Boss Hogg. While development of this game was reportedly complete, it was not commercially released (and thus it never recieved a packaging design, official instruction manual, etc).[CR]Dukes of Hazzard is not really a prototype. The game was actually burned onto regular ROM chips that were just about to be put into carts and shipped when Atari abruptly decided to cancel the game. According to the programmer Mark Hahn the game was still being worked on, so it is a mystery as to why Atari would go through the expense of manufacturing ROM chips. It appears that Dukes of Hazzard may have been the victim of internal Atari territoriality. According to Hahn he and his group were stationed in New York, while the bulk of Atari's programming staff was located in California. Apparently the California group didn't give the New York group much help or guidance and they were sort of forced to wing it.[CR]Interestingly, this wasn't Atari's first attempt at a Dukes of Hazzard game. Atari had previously attempted to rework the graphics in the unreleased game Stunt Cycle into a Dukes of Hazzard type game. It's unknown why Atari abandoned the Stunt Cycle version, but it may be because it was too outdated by the time it was ready for release. This may explain why Atari was so eager to get this Dukes of Hazzard game out the door as quickly as possible (or perhaps Atari's use of the license was about to expire). Either way, the game was never released.</plot>

        <plot>Dumbo's Flying Circus was scheduled to be part of Atari's children's series (which included characters from Peanuts, Sesame Street, Disney, Muppets, and Garfield), but for one reason or another it never saw the light of day. Atari advertised Dumbo in European Atari catalogs and even had a prototype box made, so the decision to shelve it must have been made quite late. Even though Dumbo was developed as a children's game, the gameplay is quite difficult which may be the reason why it was never released.[CR]The object of the game is to guide Dumbo around the screen and catch or shoot balloons before they reach the top of the screen (sort of like Kaboom in reverse). Some balloons have bombs attached to them and are deadly to the touch, so they must be shot down using peanuts from your trunk. Every now and then you will see a balloon with a clown riding it, you must shoot these balloons and catch the falling clown before he hits the bottom. If the clown makes it to the top of the screen he'll stay up there and begin to drop things on you. Every time three balloons reach the top of the screen the ceiling gets slightly lower, this gives you less and less room to grab the incoming balloons. The ceiling can be raised a bit by safely catching clowns or by winning the bonus round.[CR]Scoring exactly 10,000 points (or multiples of) causes the balloons to turn into the initials PcN (for Peter C. Niday).</plot>

        <plot>Based off the 1984 movie, Dune was to be an action/adventure game along the same lines the classic 2600 game Adventure. Dune was originally started by veteran programmers Bruce Poehlman and Gary Stark before they began working on the 5200 game "The Last Starfighter" (which also went unreleased). Unfortunately Gary and Bruce had only gone through the brainstorming process when work was stopped. However it appears that another programmer may have been assigned to pick up and continue work on Dune. Unfortunately only preliminary coding had been started before Jack Tramiel shut down 2600 game development and fired most of the staff.</plot>

        <plot>A strangely colored, feathered fowl is bent on bombing your bedeviled blue bear with dozens of even stranger colored eggs. Your only defense is catching those falling orbs in your hat before they break and cause a real mess! If you succeed in catching an entire wave, you get the delightful opportunity to get even and fire them back at that turkey! You'll be dazzled by his reaction. So go after that bird - if you can 'bear' the pressure. Otherwise, the yolks on you!</plot>

        <plot>A sequel to Adventure? Yes it appears that Warren was tinkering with a sequel to his smash hit Adventure in his spare time while working at The Learning Company which he founded in 1980 after leaving Atari. It’s unknown if Atari actually ordered a sequel or if Warren was doing this on his own and hoping to sell it to Atari. However since Atari was considering calling SwordQuest: Earthworld Adventure II (and Fireworld Adventure III) the later scenario sounds more plausible. Either way, this prototype has an air of mystery about it.</plot>

        <plot>This game was designed to help teach children addition, subtraction and counting. Eli needs to return to his spaceship. You move him up the ladder by solving addition or subtraction problems. A problem appears with four answer choices below. Move the joystick left or right to select your answer then press the button. After 20 questions, Eli reaches his ship. If you got 18 or more answers correct, Eli will jump for joy and there will be a flashing word WOW.[CR]The child always uses the right joystick. In two player settings, the left joystick is used by the parent to advance to the next problem, start the game and count apples. In one player, you advance automatically.[CR]The left difficulty switch is used to select one or two player. The right difficulty switch is used to select addition or subtraction. These must be selected at the main menu before you begin your game. The game select switch returns you to the main menu if you are in a game or changes the game number on the main menu. The TV Type switch switches in and out of the counting screen in a game or set the speed of the pacer (timer) on the main menu.[CR]There are three types of games, each with up to ten difficulty levels. In game type one, called Practice, there is no time limit. The child can take as long as needed to answer the problem. In game type two, called Pacer, there will be a plus or minus sign at the bottom that moves from left to right. If it reaches the right side barrier, the problem is marked as wrong then it is on to the next problem. You can set the pacer speed from the main menu with the TY Type switch. If your difficulty level allows for counting, when you switch to the counting apples screen, the timer stops and when you return, it resets. In game type three, called Phantom, in addition to having a time limit, the only answer selection that shows is the one that the arrow is under.[CR]This is one of the rarest Atari 2600 games and apparently saw fairly limited distribution.</plot>

        <plot>Silly name aside, Elk Attack is really a Pac-Man type game but without a maze. You control a Yo-Yo type machine, which must use its string to latch onto and destroy all the colored blocks on the screen. Along the way you'll encounter strange worm like creatures (sorry no elks), which will attempt to disrupt your Yo-Yo. To help you fight the worms there are power squares scattered around the board which when grabbed will render your Yo-Yo temporarily invincible and increase your speed. However unlike Pac-Man touching a worm while invincible will only net you points, and will not destroy of them. Because of this its best to just go about your business and clear the maze instead of hunting down the worms.[CR]Elk Attack is a port of the obscure Taito arcade game Electric Yo-Yo! Programmer Mark Hahn named the game Elk Attack as a joke, and probably would have changed the name had it been published. The game was left in its current state.[CR]The following is hidden in the code: ELK ATTACK (c) 1987 Mark R. Hahn</plot>

On hairpin turns to Tennessee, to the zero-visibility of a New England fog. And back. There is no finish line. Driver Qualifications: You never fear, never sleep. Your only goal in life is to break your own last record, rev that extra RPM, race that extra mile. Spend most of your time in fast lanes. Usually see competitors in your rear-view mirror. You are your own idol. The race is set. Are you?</plot>

        <plot>The Entity is an unreleased 20th Century Fox game based on a horror movie sharing the same name. It's odd that Fox decided to go forward with this project, given the movie's disturbing adult theme where a young woman is raped by a ghost. This could very well be why Fox didn't release the game, although the game itself has little in common with the movie's subject matter. The Entity was programmed by Mark Kline, who was responsible for two other unreleased Fox games, Pick Up and Look Ahead.[CR]The cart, box and manual are reproductions from 2003 with permission of programmer Mark Klein.</plot>

I found myself in a time and place unknown to me. The planet is inhabited by giant bug-like creatures. The inhabitants explained that they are part of a culture originally insect-like but now almost entirely mechanical. A group of the inhabitants started programming themselves to survive at the expense of others in the society. After the complete metamorphosis to computer controlled minds, these bugs began attacking the good creatures. The good bugs have asked for my help. I have been put in command of the best machine bug on their planet. My task of saving the good bugs should prove extremely difficult since the bad bugs have created creature machines programmed solely for the purpose of stopping me.</plot>

        <plot>Talk about a game with convoluted history! It was once thought that Spinning Fireball, along with Pizza Chef, Immies and Aggies, and A Mysterious Thief, were all original games developed by a PAL company called Suntek. However after much research it has been determined that these are in fact original NTSC games released by two different companies called Zimag and Vidco, which may have been related somehow. So why were these games developed for the NTSC market but never released? Read on to find out.[CR]Spinning Fireball is a half hearted attempt at a 3D target shooting game. This is probably something that shouldn't have ever been attempted on the 2600, but Vidco decided to try it anyway. The result is a game that looks decent, but plays horribly. The goal of the game is to have your wizard create and shoot a fireball at the catapult that movies across the top of the screen.[CR]The controls for Spinning Fireball are bit difficult to master, which is just as well as you probably won't want to play this game very long. To create your fireball, simply push and hold the joystick forward. Once the fireball starts to spin (hence the name Spinning Fireball), press the fire button to shoot it. The direction the fireball flies is based on the direction it was spinning when the button was pressed (sort of like the hammer throw in Track and Field). If you are facing right the fireball will rotate clockwise, otherwise if you left the fireball will rotate counterclockwise. If your shot actually manages to hit the catapult (and good luck with that), then you will be taken to the second level. [CR]While Spinning Fireball may be short on thrills, there are some dangers you will face during your fire slinging exploits. If your fireball hits the sides of the screen it will bounce back at you. Likewise if you shoot your fireball straight up, it will come back down (run!). If you manage to get hit by your wayward fireball, you will lose a life. Also, the catapult at the top of the screen will occasionally shoot a fireball at you, as you may have guessed, being hit by this fireball will also result in losing a life. You also have a limited amount of time to finish each level, if the timer hits zero you will (say it with me now) lose a life. The timer starts a five minutes for the first level, and decreases one minute for each successive level (down to two minutes starting on level four).[CR]While it won't win any awards for good graphics or gameplay, Spinning Fireball is an interesting attempt to breathe some innovation into the tired old shooter formula. Unfortunately the result was a game that needs more variety and polish before it could be considered fun to play. The frustrating control scheme makes hitting the catapult more a matter of luck than skill. There's a reason these games never made it to the US.</plot>

        <plot>Something must be done! Another American space ship has been reported missing. Far too many of our explorers have disappeared near the mysterious Spider City for this to be merely a coincidence. A rescue ship must be dispatched immediately! But who would volunteer for such a mission? Who would have the courage to descend into the tunnels of that awful city and battle with the wicked Spider Warriors? Who would risk being trapped by a dreadful Disruptor? There is only one person who could measure up to such a challenge - Flash Gordon to the rescue!</plot>

        <plot>This game is not as 'simple' as it looks! Select any one of eight traffic patterns inspired by the most treacherous traffic you'll ever encounter on the nation's highways. Traffic flow varies from a few slow-moving autos to frantic rush hour intensity, complete with blaring horns and roaring engines - everything except exhaust! Test your agility, cunning and courage by helping your 'daredevil chicken' across the freeway. You get a point for each crossing, but you'll need quick reflexes and great timing to make it across without getting hit. Freeway by Activision is unlike any video game you've ever seen. It's fast, tricky and traffic-jammed with fun!</plot>

        <plot>Frog Pond is a games that Atari never officially released to the public. 2 different versions exist with this - one with a "rainbow" title screen, and one with a detailed graphics screen (most likely the final version). An even earlier (work-in-progress) version was shown at the Summer 1982 CES show. Prototypes (and possibly copies) have been available for some time now. Best Electronics had it for $12 at one time. [CR]The game has nice, clean graphics. The game features nice, clean graphics, with 1 or 2 frogs on a lily pad. Each frog even has its own realistic "ribbet" sound. The object is to leap and catch as many insects as you can with your frog's tongue. Pressing the fire button shoots your frog's tongue out. The difficulty switches affect the length of your tongue (a little longer when set to B). There are four game variations: 1 and 3 are one-player versions; 2 and 4 are two-player versions. You are allowed so many misses-an insect will fly away if you fail to get it after a certain time limit. Games 3 and 4 allow more misses, but less time to get the insects. There are five types of insects. [CR]The game subject and total lack of difficulty shows this game was going to be aimed at small children, much like Nick Tuner's previous game Demons to Diamonds. This and the fact that it looked almost identical to Mattel's Frogs and Flies could have been the reason it was eventually not released.[CR]The cart, (green) box and manual are reproductions from 2004.</plot>

It was programmed by UA Ltd., the same company that programmed all the games for the Emerson Arcadia 2001. It's unknown why this game (and the other UA prototypes) was never released commercially.[CR]Trivia[CR]Development and release[CR]UA Limited created Pleiades, Funky Fish and Cat Trax, among others, for the Arcadia 2001. They ported these three to the Atari 2600 but decided against releasing them. The ROMs were discovered in the early 90s and have been released on cartridge by AtariAge.com.</plot>

        <plot>Garfield is a side-scrolling platform video game for the Atari 2600 that Atari planned, but cancelled because of the videogame crash of 1983.[CR]1984 wasn't a good year for Atari (or the video game industry in general). Because of this Atari decided to stop developing games that it didn't think would sell in large numbers. Once Atari was sold to the Tramiels, they took a look at Garfield and decided they didn't want to pay the high royalties to Jim Davis and Steve Woita, so the game was canceled. When Woita heard this, he didn't take the news very well, but he had little time to protest as most of Atari's staff was laid off. To make a long story short, Garfield was never finished. According to Woita, Garfield still needed about 2 to 3 months of work before it would be complete. The final game was to have hundreds of screens and probably would have been the largest 2600 game to date. Garfield finally turned up when Jim Davis finally gave Woita permission to distribute the rom</plot>

        <plot>This is a version of Scrabble for the Atari 2600.The letters on the top row are shuffled and then you use them to make words on the bottom row. If the bottom row shows all spaces in pink or red, then the points for the word are doubled or tripled, respectively. If there is a light blue or blue line under a space, then the points for that letter are doubled or tripled, respectively. After you create a word, move down to the E button and press the red joystick button one time. This stops the timer so you can confirm the word is acceptable. If the word is acceptable, press the button again to collect points and go to the next round. If not, move to the P button to pass on the word and go to the next round. In a two player game, after you press the E button once, the other player then must press the button again to enter the word. Play continues until you have 14 rounds in a one player game or 7 each in a two player game.Difficulty switchesUse the left switch to set the number of players; B for one player, A for two.Game variationsThere are five games, each with five skill levels.The skill levels differ by the amount of time you have to make words.Skill levels for one player games-Skill level 1=unlimited time (no clock)Skill level 2=132 secondsSkill level 3=39 secondsSkill level 4=26 secondsSkill level 5=random timesFor two player games, the times are half of what they are in one player.The games are-Game 1 (Billboard)- After each round, all the letters are reshuffled, so you get a whole new set of seven letters. Any letters that were not used go back into the mix.Game 2 (Skill Builder)- Only the letters you used to make the word are replaced. Any unused letters stay on the top spaces.Game 3 (Times Up)- You are given seven letters only. You must use these seven to make as many words as you can.Game 4 (Encore)- The letters on the top row all shift to the right, with the last letter disappearing and a new letter plopping into the first spot. You must grab you letters and place them quickly. Any letters the you don't use will reappear randomly again.Game 5 (Over the Edge)- Same as game 4 but letters that disappear never return.</plot>

        <description>Good Luck, Charlie Brown (USA) (Proto)</description>
        <rom name="No_Intro_Sept_2016/No_Intro_A1.zip/Good%20Luck%2C%20Charlie%20Brown%20%28USA%29%20%28Proto%29.zip" size="3178"/>
        <plot>Good Luck Charlie Brown should have been the last of the Children's Work Shop releases, but never saw the light of day. Although the game was found a long time ago, the rom had not been dumped until quite recently so the game is still a bit of a mystery. The only known version is very incomplete with little gameplay implemented, but rumors persist of a far more complete version in existence. [CR]The game only consists of one screen in which you control Charlie Brown as he flies his kite around the screen. At the bottom of the screen there's a wind gauge which shows the speed and direction of the wind. There's also a timer a the bottom of the screen which slowly counts up which may be part of the scoring system (based on total time instead of score). You goal is to fly your kite as long as possible while avoiding birds, balloons, rockets, and of course the deadly Kite Eating Tree. According to the catalog description, if Charlie Brown lost his kite he would have to earn another chance by raking leaves (what fun!). Obviously this part of the game was not implemented yet.[CR]Pushing the joystick left and right moves Charlie Brown around the screen. Pushing up and down will let out or pull in the kite string, thus making the kite move up and down. If the kite hits an obstacle the game will freeze for a moment and Charlie Brown will have to start again, but if the kite hits the Kite Eating Tree, Charlie Brown will actually flip over and all the balloons will turn black due to the fact that they share a color pallet with Charlie Brown and gets glitched up when he flips over. Occasionally what appears to be lightning will flash in the background, but doesn't seem to have any adverse effects other than scaring the player (I actually jumped the first time this happened). The lightning only appears if you move your kite into the clouds and it increases if you move into the higher layer of clouds. [CR]Interestingly it appears that by using the second joystick the player has some limited control the rom of balloons. This could be the start of an unfinished two player variation of the game (code hints at four possible variations), but it is very preliminary in this prototype. There are no sounds or music in this version of the game, but this isn't surprising since sounds and music were usually one of the last things to finished. The graphics appear to be top notch, but are slightly glitchy. For example, the clouds appear to randomly disappear and reappear at various times during the game. The row of birds also appears to suffer from this, but not to the same degree as the clouds. This is obviously a sign that the game was still early in development.. [CR]According to the catalogs Good Luck Charlie Brown was supposed to be to released Summer of 83, and since this prototype is dated April of 84 we can assume development was taking longer than expected. By 1984 Atari had canceled the Children's series so Good Luck Charlie Brown would have been canceled with it. It's a shame though, because what was finished looks rather interesting.</plot>

        <plot>Gophers have launched a merciless assault on your carrot patch. Grab your shovel and fill those holes before they tunnel out and eat your choice carrots. With no time to run back to the barn for more seeds to plant, it's a good thing that crazy duck keeps flying by dropping them. But it's awfully tricky to catch a seed, plant it, and still keep those persistent Gophers away. Just when you think everything's under control, they get faster and hungrier! Take a deep breath, and let the battle begin.</plot>

You fire by holding down the button and moving the joystick in the direction you want to shoot. You can shoot from the front of your ship, from the back or from either side.[CR]As you move forward, you can increase to four speeds. You must avoid or shoot the meteorites, shoot the aliens (but be warned: they shoot back), and always run from the super alien.[CR]On the screen, at the top is your score, just below that is the short range scanner. This shows you, the aliens, the meteorites and, if you run into it, the super alien. On the bottom left is the remaining ships (lives) On the bottom right is the velocity indicator. On the bottom center is the long range scanner. This shows you, the aliens and the super alien, but not the meteorites.[CR]As the super alien approaches, there will be an alarm sound. If the super alien catches you, you will be unable to move or fire and will lose a life. The game ends if you lose all your lives or get 999,999 points.</plot>

It's unknown why the game got canned, but it may be due to Atari pulling the plug on the 2600 Children's series after its less than stellar performance.

Hero to my associates), President and Chief Executive Officer of H.E.R.O., Inc., inviting you to join me in tackling a tricky maze of mine shafts rife with the kind of danger we daring types only dream of. Until now, that is! Think of it: miners trapped in a mountain bubbling with lava rivers and magma deposits; mine shafts crawling with vile vermin, all lethal to the touch. Oh, it's just too awful - and too exciting! Did I mention the terrible tentacles that loom up out of lava? Or the massive walls that can crush me? What about the raft I ride on? Oh, never mind.

        <rom name="No_Intro_Sept_2016/No_Intro_A1.zip/Hard-Head%20%28USA%29%20%28Proto%29.zip" size="3413"/>
        <plot>Along with UAG#1 this mysterious prototype was found in a salvage yard in 1998 by Ben Liashenko. For many years we did not know the name of this game since the label that once existed had long since fallen off. However in 2017 another copy of this game appeared on Ebay UK complete with a label. We now know that the game is called Hard Head.[CR]Hard Head plays somewhat like Atari's Save Mary. However this time instead of building a tower by dropping bricks from the top of the screen, you must bump blocks from the bottom of the screen. Before you start screaming about Activision copying Atari's idea, keep in mind that this game was programmed about seven years before Save Mary. I'm sure the similarity of the concepts is just a coincidence.[CR]In Hard Head you control a little Space Invader guy who must use the blocks at the bottom of the screen to build a tower and escape. As the blocks come rolling down the conveyor belt, you must jump up and bump them so they land somewhere on the screen (the blocks don't count if they go off the edge of the screen). The movement scheme in this prototype is a bit unusual as the longer you hold the joystick in a direction, the faster your little guy will run. Although this is very realistic, it is a bit odd for a 2600 game and may take some time to get used to. Once you have constructed a nice little tower, you must carefully jump on the conveyor belt and them climb the tower. Be extra careful on the conveyor belt, as touching the blocks will cause your little guy to be flattened. [CR]Starting on the second level, you'll undoubtedly notice that some blocks will flash yellow or blue. These colored blocks are actually part of an elaborate timing/bonus system. The yellow block (which I call the Bump block) moves up the tower at the rate of once block a second, while the blue block (which I call the Bonus block) moves up the tower one block every time the yellow block reaches the top of the screen. If your character happen to be on the tower when the yellow block touches him, you will be knocked down one level (slowing your decent up the tower). However if your character touches the blue 'Bonus' block, you will gain bonus points as long as he remains on the block. However greed can be a dangerous thing as the tower will collapse after a certain amount of time (determined by the difficulty level). When the warning alarm sounds, you have exactly 10 seconds to hightail it up the tower or you'll be crushed under the debris.[CR]Starting on the third level, strange aliens creatures will begin to fly around the screen. You can destroy them by hitting them with a flying block. Smashing aliens is worth 180 points, while simply bumping a block will net you 5 points. If you let the octopus alien reach the bottom of the screen he'll start breeding and clog the area. However since you can simply knock the extra aliens out of the way so he's not a really big problem. If you're really tricky you can use the blocks to fence in the alien and keep him form reaching the bottom, but this is more trouble than it's worth. Starting on the fourth level a squat looking alien with two legs will rapidly move down the screen and try to catch your guy at the bottom of the screen. When this happens you'll need to jump on the conveyer belt temporarily to escape until he disappears. Unfortunately this alien is immune to the blocks so all you can do is avoid him. If you manage to score 100,000 points the score counter will reset to zero and you will be rewarded with an extra life.[CR]Unlike most Activision games, Hard Head has no game variations. However since this is still a WIP, game variations may have been planned later on. The left difficulty switch controls the game difficulty (A=Easy, B=Hard), while the right switch appears to control how your character climbs the blocks. When the right difficulty switch is in the 'B' position you cannot touch the center of the tower, as doing so will result in a block smashing your character. Instead you must build the tower in a staircase-like fashion and climb up the edges of the blocks. Naturally this is much more difficult to set up than a simple tower of blocks, so this variation is recommended for experts only. When the right switch is in the 'A' position, your character can climb up the center of the blocks making things much easier. Although this prototype appears to be nearly complete, there are still a few bugs in the game. Glitches include such things as your character getting stuck in the walls, and the screen becoming unstable when being bumped by the yellow block or when avoiding the leg alien.[CR]The graphics and sounds for this title are top notch; it's obvious that a lot of work went into this game. Everything from the smooth animation of your character to the cute "Can-Can" sequence at the start of the game screams quality. So why was this game never released? Unfortunately no one but the programmer knows the answer to this, but one possibility is that they may have left Activision before the game was completed. However since the real name of this game has now been discovered, we may yet be able to find the programmer and discover the history behind this interesting game.[CR]Special thanks to Mitch and bjk7382 for figuring out how to play the game in the 'A' position.</plot>

        <plot>At the start, there's sniper machine gun fire from the bushes. When the shooter stops briefly to reload, you can run past. To reach the 2nd woman, you have to jump over the lake. Run until the last moment (your heel is on the edge), then press the button to jump. If you jump too soon, you fall into the water. After the woman on the island, you move to the level above, where you have to run by a fire-breathing dragon. You have to time it right to run by when he pauses blowing fire. You can only make it to the hole in the ground. Push the button to drop in, and a woman appears. If you get too greedy here, she turns into a snake and... Ow! Time leaving the pit to avoid the dragon, and run off the screen to the left. You will then be on the top level, where you have to chase a woman. Meanwhile, gargoyles appear in random positions and drop molten lava. If a gargoyle appears over you when you are "scoring points" with her (listen for the warning sound), you must push the button to release her and run. You can catch her again, and continue indefinitely, except that the gargoyles speed up each time you catch her. When you get to 69 points you get another life (you start out with 3).</plot>

        <plot>Hole Hunter is a whack-a-mole-style game for the Atari 2600. You control a man with a hammer, who seems to be in the desert, and is surrounded by holes. Periodically the holes will light up and then some sort of rodent appears popping out of it and you need to smash him back down his burrow. If you don’t hit him in time then he will escape and run around the screen trying to bit you. Hitting a rodent gives you 100 points and if he touches you then you will lose points. You also have to be careful not to fall down a hole as you run around the screen, if you do then you will lose one of your 3 lives. You are given 20 minutes to get the highest score possible. When the times runs out or you lose all 3 lives it’s game over.</plot>

        <plot>Each round consists of twenty-five moles. When a mole pops out of his hole, press the corresponding button on the Kid's Controller to whack it. The faster you hit him, the more points you'll get. If the King Mole pops up, whack him for even higher points. Beware of the acorn. If it pops up, don't whack it as it will cost you points. You must score at least three hundred points by the time the mole count reaches zero. If you reach or exceed three hundred points in one round, any points beyond three hundred will be added to your score as a bonus. If you fail to score three hundred points in one round, the game is over.[CR]Holey Moley is an unreleased prototype written by Bob Polaro. The game was originally programmed back in 1983, but was never commercially released due to ownership changes at Atari. This game requires the use of the Kid's Controller, although the keyboard and touch pad controllers work fine with it also.[CR]A version of Holey Moley complete with a cartridge, manual, box and Kid's Controller overlay was sold at the 2002 Classic Gaming Expo. You can purchase a copy of Holey Moley by visiting Atari2600.com.[CR]Holey Moley is a port of a rare 1982 arcade game by Tai. According to Bob Polaro, the game was shelved due to the change in management at Atari. Whatever the reason for its cancellation, Holey Moley appears to be complete and fully playable.[CR]The cart, box and manual are reproductions from 2002 with permission of programmer Bob Polaro.</plot>

Now if the little guy can just make it up a couple of big mountains, he'll get a big bear hug. A game especially for children - but the graphics are anything but kid's stuff.</plot>

        <plot>Immies and Aggies is an odd shooting game that involves marbles (yes marbles). For you see, Immies and Aggies are actually types of marbles (Aggies are agates, while Immies are glass imitations of agates), although from the game graphics you really can't tell. In fact the graphics consist mostly of squares that appear to be randomly placed around the screen. If you squint and stare really hard at the screen you can almost imagine that those squares are anything (marbles, alien bases, E.T. carts, etc.). However the poor graphics really don't distract much from the poor gameplay. There's a reason these things weren't released in the US...[CR]Other Versions:[CR] Immies and Aggies [CCE][CR]Spectracube Invasion [Suntek][CR]Spectracube [Unknown]</plot>

        <plot>Ixion is a port of the unreleased 1983 Sega coin-op of the same name, Ixion is an interesting game that doesn't seem to play like anything else in the 2600 library. Your goal in Ixion is to grab the five white squares scattered across the screen and spell the word Ixion before your time runs out. At the start of each level only certain squares are visible, and to get around more easily you must first reveal the missing squares. To reveal the missing squares, the player must move a brown sphere over an empty square. This sphere is normally stationary, but it can be moved by shooting or ramming into it. This sends the sphere bouncing around the screen, revealing squares and destroying enemies in its travels. After a short time of bouncing around the sphere will stop, requiring the player to move it again to reveal more squares. Learning how to move the sphere where you want is the key to mastering Ixion. Also moving around the game grid are enemy drones, which will attempt to destroy your ship. Unfortunately, their shots destroy tiles, making your path much more difficult to traverse. Enemy drones only take one shot to defeat, but will take out the tile they are on when they explode.[CR]It is unknown why Ixion was never released by SEGA, but it was around this time that SEGA Enterprises (the American arm of SEGA) was sold to Bally. After this sale, all of SEGA's 2600 titles were Bally/Midway arcade games (Tapper, Spy Hunter, and Up 'n Down). It may have been felt that only well known arcade game would sell well enough in the overly competitive 2600 market, or perhaps Ixion simply got lost in the transition shuffle.</plot>

        <plot>In Knight on the Town, you play a knight who needs to get across the moat to save a buxom princess, but the only way across is for the knight to build a drawbridge, piece by piece. While building the bridge, the knight must dodge a dragon's fire, an alligator swimming in the moat and a little gremlin with a big mouth to bite the knight's penis off. To make matters worse, the gremlin moves faster for every piece of bridge placed. The goal of this game is to get across a completed drawbridge and climb to the top of the tower to get the princess in the least amount of time. For Lady in Wading, a studly prince is abducted and an Amazon takes the knight's place.</plot>

        <plot>The basic gameplay of Kabobber is very simple; you must hop on the enemy before he hops on you. To help you gang up on the enemy you are given command of an army of Buvskies. Your Buvskies troops appear in each of the squares immediately surrounding your character. When first summoned your Buvskies are only babies who must first conquer an enemy Kabobber to be promoted to full strength. Baby Buvskies can only conquer the green Guvskies and are crushed by all other enemies, so you must protect them until they reach full strength. You are given a limited number of baby Buvskies (displayed at the bottom of the screen), although you can gain extra Buvskies by conquering enemy troops (you are limited to nine reserve Buvskies). Your army moves with you in a square formation, so the more troops you have on the screen the bigger the target you are. However the more troops you have the more enemies you can crush, and you'll have a less chance of being totally annihilated by a rampaging enemy mob.[CR]Kabobber was never advertised or mentioned in any Activision catalog. No instruction manual was ever made for it and the game was never released. Only one prototype is known to exist, assumably from programmer Rex Bradford himself. According to Bradford: 'What happened was that I "finished" the game in the standard 4K cartridge size, then Activision said they liked the game and would like me to expand it to an 8K cartridge and keep working on it. I had basically run out of ideas for the game at that point, and resisted. Anyway, I didn't feel like working on it more, and Activision didn't want to publish it as is (and was probably a little miffed at my attitude, though they never said so), and that was that.'</plot>

        <plot>There was no mention of Kamikaze Saucers on any game list, but Syncro did take out full page ads for the game so they must have been close to releasing it. Eventually, Syncro made the decision in staying out of the crumbling video game market.[CR]Kamikaze Saucers was a little known 2600 game that most people assumed was never even started. However after the programmer gave the rom image to Atari Age to be distributed to the gaming community, the game proved to be very much real. There was no mention of Kamikaze Saucers on any game list, but Syncro did take out full page ads for the game so they must have been close to releasing it. All these things make this prototype all the more interesting, and makes one wonder what other games Syncro may have had in the works.[CR]Kamikaze Saucers is your average shooter along the lines of Atlantis or Demon Attack. You must shoot down the saucers that buzz across the screen using your oversized phallic looking ship. If if fail to shoot the saucers down in a timely manner they will go Kamikaze on you big time! Three large ships will come at you from the top of the screen, and if you can't destroy them before they crash into you you'll lose a life.</plot>

        <plot>Klax features a conveyor belt at the top of the screen. It constantly rolls toward the playing area, delivering a steady supply of blocks. The player controls a small device which sits at the interface between the conveyor belt and the playing area, and can be moved left and right to catch the blocks and either deposit them in the playing area or push them back up the conveyor belt. The device can hold up to five blocks. A block which is not caught and placed in the playing area or pushed back up the belt is considered a drop. The blocks are solid colours, but there is also a flashing block which can be used as a wildcard on any colour.[CR]According to AtariProtos.com, this was the last game released for the Atari 2600 by Atari. Although it was ported to the NTSC format, it was never released in that format. [CR]Making a big ‘X’ will warp you far ahead in the game. These secret warps are not mentioned in the game.[CR]Completing the game (wave 100) will show a celebratory screen with fireworks.</plot>

        <plot>Klax features a conveyor belt at the top of the screen. It constantly rolls toward the playing area, delivering a steady supply of blocks. The player controls a small device which sits at the interface between the conveyor belt and the playing area, and can be moved left and right to catch the blocks and either deposit them in the playing area or push them back up the conveyor belt. The device can hold up to five blocks. A block which is not caught and placed in the playing area or pushed back up the belt is considered a drop. The blocks are solid colours, but there is also a flashing block which can be used as a wildcard on any colour.[CR]According to AtariProtos.com, this was the last game released for the Atari 2600 by Atari. Although it was ported to the NTSC format, it was never released in that format. [CR]Making a big ‘X’ will warp you far ahead in the game. These secret warps are not mentioned in the game.[CR]Completing the game (wave 100) will show a celebratory screen with fireworks.</plot>

        <plot>Over the years Apollo has released some strange games. From the airline luggage simulator Lost Luggage to the egg throwing antics of Wabbit, Apollo was never afraid to release something different. Therefore it's no surprise that when a new unknown Apollo prototype surfaced, it featured some interesting gameplay. However Kyphus may be the strangest game from Apollo yet...[CR]Looking a little like a cross between Racquetball and Space Cavern, Kyphus is an odd game in which the player must maneuver a dumpy looking guy through a pseudo-3D maze of rooms avoiding what appears to be a glowing cloud that shoots lasers, while being followed by a multi-colored robot that just might be a monkey in disguise. Like I said, this game is weird!.[CR]Unfortunately, this prototype is very incomplete. There appears to be no collision detection, few sounds, and almost no gameplay. The only thing one can really do in this prototype is to move run from room to room, although with no collision detection implemented there is no threat from the robot or cloud. Each room of the maze appears to have a different color, and has three to four exits (two on the sides and one at the top and bottom). The maze is made up of 64 rooms, but doesn't appear to have a set pattern.[CR]As you move through maze, you may notice the score and life counters start displaying odd letters and numbers. These number and letters are actually variable values in hex decimal notation. The programmer used these numbers to help determine the values of various game variables while developing the game. The counters at the top of the screen display the players position coordinates, the left two digits in the score are a timer of some sort that is continually counting down, while the right two digits appear to be the room number. It is unusual to see these in game unless it is very early in the development cycle.[CR]Although the prototype isn't very playable, by taking a look in the game itself we can puzzle out some planned gameplay. Hidden in the code are three words: Protect, Destroy, and Invoke. It is thought that these are commands the player would give the robot to make it do certain things. Also hidden in the game code are graphics for what appears to be a large monkey that would have replaced the robot. It is currently unknown how the monkey would be used in the game, and there is no way to trigger it (without hacking the code) in the current prototype.[CR]Although Kyphus is unplayble in its current state, it shows quite a bit of promise. Getting the 2600 to display anything that looks remotely like 3D is an amazing feat. It is thought that in the final version of the game the player would have a weapon of some type to shoot at the cloud and robot, but the object of the game is still unclear. Hopefully a more complete version of the game will turn up someday, but for now we can be happy in that another lost prototype has finally been found.[CR]Only one prototype of Kyphus is known to exist. It is thought that in the final version of the game the player would have a weapon of some type to shoot at the cloud and robot, but the object of the game is still unclear. A picture of the box was shown in a few Apollo advertisements. It appears to show a wizard battling evil clouds in a temple which is fairly close to the gameplay in the current prototype.[CR]Hidden in the code are three words: Protect, Destroy and Invoke. It is thought that these are commands the player would give the robot to make it do certain things. Also hidden in the game code are graphics for what appears to be a large monkey that would have replaced the robot. It is currently unknown how the monkey would be used in the game, and there is no way to trigger it in the current prototype.</plot>

        <plot>A vast automatic defense computer has gone haywire, and players man the Dante Dart, an agile spacecraft, in a last-ditch effort to disarm the computer before it self-destructs. And what would an automatic defense system be without its own defenses? The player's ship must avoid making physical contact with anything else in the game, though the computer's force fields are the deadliest obstacles. The force fields can't be disabled, only avoided through careful timing. Other defenses are launched toward the player's ship constantly, and the only chance of survival is a combination of quick shooting and picking up every energy recharge pod in sight. Ultimately the Dante Dart must destroy four key components of the computer, making for some joystick-rattling boss battles.</plot>

        <plot>The first thing you're bound to notice upon booting Lasercade is how nice the graphics look. It's hard to believe that the 2600 can do a 3/4th perspective shooting game, but Lasercade is the proof. The goal of the game is to shoot all the targets in the upper section of the screen before time runs out (that's original). However, while you can just start shooting willy nilly, you should probably take a second to look at the funny little targets in the middle section of the screen. [CR]In the middle section of the the screen there are three rotating mirrors. As you may have guessed, these mirrors can play havoc with your laser if you're not careful. If you shoot a mirror while it is facing you, it will reflect the laser back at you and you will lose some time and be momentarily stunned. However if you shoot the mirror while its back is to you, you can destroy it so it won't bother you until the next round. While this may sound a bit complicated, it's often best just to ignore the mirrors and shoot at the targets themselves. The number of mirrors can be controlled with the left difficulty switch.</plot>

        <plot>Based on the obscure 1981 Venture Line coin-op of the same name. It's unknown why Looping was never released since the game seems to be finished and was even advertised. One reason may be the high difficulty of the game which really takes away most of the fun.[CR]As the game title suggests, this game involves looping. By looping I mean that your plane can only move in circles instead up the normal up, down ,left, right movement of most games. By pushing up or down, your plane will begin to arch and start its loop (pushing left and right has no effect). Normally this wouldn't be a huge problem, but your plane also moves very VERY fast, so it's quite easy to crash into the ground or another obstacle before your can complete your loop. One interesting thing to note is that if your plane hits the top of the screen it will nosedive straight down. While at first this may seem like a major inconvenience, it can be used to your advantage if you're crafty enough. [CR]The cart, box and manual are reproductions from 2003.</plot>

        <plot>The Lord of the Rings: Journey to Rivendell has been the subject of speculation for many years by Atari collectors. Now one of the most sought-after Atari 2600 prototypes is finally available. What's the story, you ask?[CR]Way back in 1983 Parker Brothers featured this game in one of their catalogs. Video game and Tolkien fans alike were excited by this announcement, but the wait would be in vain. Lord of the Rings was never released, and Parker Brothers reportedly informed people that called and asked for the game that it was sold out in an attempt to cover up for the fact that it was never published.</plot>

        <plot>Meltdown is basically a game of hide and seek that place on a 4x4 grid of atoms. At the start of each round you will see a rogue quark move about the reactor agitating the atoms. Each time the quark touches one of atoms it will strip off some of the electrons and atom will shrink. Once an atom has lost all it's electrons it will become unstable, if all the atoms destabilize the reactor will blow![CR]Why 20th Century Fox decided to cancel Meltdown is unknown, but was most likely due to the collapsing video game market. The decision to cancel the game must have been made at the last moment, as advertisements proudly boasting 'Just Released' had already been printed. Although Meltdown was displayed at the 1983 CES show, it was never seen again after the show closed. Long thought lost, Meltdown surfaced in a resale shop in 2004 where by chance it was discovered by a passing collector.</plot>

        <rom name="No_Intro_Sept_2016/No_Intro_A1.zip/Mind%20Maze%20%28USA%29.zip" size="2830"/>
        <plot>A game based on ESP? Yes you heard me right, Mind Maze is the first (and only) Atari game to be based on the unproven (yet still popular) theory of ESP (Extra Sensory Perception). It appears Atari was attempting to develop a sort of "Mind Reading" game for its new Mindlink controller. So can the 2600 really read your thoughts? Read on to find out...[CR]Mind Maze is played somewhat like those old mind reading experiments where a scientist would hold up a card and ask a person to tell him what was on the other side. Depending on the game selected, two to four cards appear on the screen each round. The player then must try and guess the "correct" card by highlighting it (using the joystick) and pressing the fire button. Unfortunately this is where the game begins to fall apart. As you've probably guessed the theory of ESP is pretty far fetched, and the odds that the player can continually guess the correct card is slim. So the player must simply sit there and randomly select cards until he by chance selects the correct one. Predictably, this gets boring very fast...[CR]After choosing a card all but one of the card pictures will disappear, and the computer will then highlight the "correct" card on the screen. If the player is playing with the "Race" option, the game will show a solid blue screen and wait for the player to press a button before continuing to the next round. This blue screen (which would have been spruced up for the final release) was probably there to allow the other player to get ready for his turn. However since there is no two player option in this version, it doesn't really serve any point. The player may also "pass" on the current set of cards by pressing the button without selecting a card. This will cause a new set of cards to appear but it will still be the players turn. There doesn't seem to be a limit on the number of times you can pass, but the game will not advance until the player picks a card.[CR]The current score is shown at the bottom of the screen. The left digit appears to be the players score, while the right digit counts the number of rounds played. When the player reaches 20 points they win the game and are returned to the main screen. By setting the right difficulty switch to B, the player can activate the "Cheat" mode. When the cheat mode is activated selecting any card will score the player points (thus making the game completely pointless). When the switch is put back in A position the scoring is set back to normal (as normal as scoring gets in this game anyway). The cheat mode was probably put in by the programmer to help the ESP challenged debug the game.[CR]As I mentioned earlier, Mind Maze appears to have several options which can be set for each game. The main screen lists four options: # of Choices (2, 3, or 4), Race/No Race, Picture/Color, and Past/Future. [CR]# of Choices - This sets the number of cards that appears on the screen. The game defaults to two choices, but can be set as high as four. Obviously the more choices there are, the harder the game becomes.[CR]Race/No Race - This option is for setting up a two player "race" game. The only visible effect this option seems to have is activating or deactivating the blue screen. Setting the game to 'Race' causes the solid blue screen to appear between rounds, while setting it to 'No Race' skips this screen.[CR]Picture/Color - This option affects the cards themselves. Selecting 'Picture' will cause the game to display a series of beautiful pictures on the cards (everything from castles to goldfish), while selecting color will replace these pictures with a block of solid color. When playing the 'Color' game, the picture actually hides behind one of the cards and is not visible to the player. Selecting one of the cards will cause the picture to be revealed and the game will proceed to the next round (after awarding the appropriate points). [CR]Past/Future - Out of all the options in the game, this one is the strangest. As the name suggests this option affects the order in which players try to predict the cards (trying to guess the card that was just played or the card about to be played). If set to Past the 2600 will select the "correct" card before the player chooses. If the option is set to Future the 2600 will select the correct card as the player chooses.[CR]Unlike more advanced games such as Motorodeo, the player cannot actually change the game options directly. Instead the player must keep selecting game numbers until the combination of rules he wants is found. Since there are four different options (one with three choices), there are a whopping 24 different game variations in this prototype (3*2*2*2). Not too shabby for a game from 1984.[CR]If you haven't already noticed by the screenshots, the graphics in Mind Maze are absolutely gorgeous. Each picture is large and well detailed (a rarity on the 2600). The graphics also have a really cool 'Fade In' effect that adds a bit of eye candy to an otherwise drab looking game. Excellent graphics in a game so early in the development cycle are rare, as the programmer usually put bland 'placeholder' graphics in until the gameplay was finished. One has to wonder what other little surprises the programmer had in store for us.[CR]Although Mind Maze is constantly listed as being a Mindlink game, this prototype doesn't appear to use or require the strange controller. However according to the programmers, Mind Maze was definitely meant to be a Mindlink game. Supposedly the headband was to read the players Alpha and Beta waves in an attempt to help predict their actions. However since the Mindlink was really just a sensor that detected muscle movements in the players forehead, this was complete bunk. The whole mind reading idea was just another angle thought up by Atari's marketing department.[CR]Although the theory behind Mind Maze was pretty far out there, it does show just how far Atari was willing to go to develop games for its new Mindlink controller. Mind Maze was ultimately scrapped due to to the limited appeal of the "game" (or perhaps the marketing department finally stopped smoking those funny little cigarettes). However Mind Maze would not be the last game to dabble in the paranormal, several years later another mind reading game called "Taboo: The Sixth Sense" was released for the NES. Unfortunately this game was pretty much laughed off the store shelves and faded into obscurity. It appears that Atari made the right decision after all.</plot>

        <plot>Something terrible has happened in the maze-like Mines of Minos. The smoothly running robot operation has been interrupted by an invasion of monstrous alien life forms! Aliens stalk the corridors of the mine; only a single robot survives to battle them. Desperately he struggles to find and assemble pieces of his fellow robots scattered around the mine while avoiding the pursuing aliens. If he can assemble a large enough robot army, he can battle the aliens to fight his way down to deeper levels of the mine and even destroy the alien command center at the lowest level. But if the aliens catch him he is doomed and his only weapon against them is his stock of time bombs.</plot>

        <plot>Miss Piggy's Wedding was a two-player game created in 1983 for the Atari 2600 console. The game was advertised in Atari catalogs, but never made it to final release, due to Atari's cancellation of their Children's series. A prototype of the game was discovered in the late '90s by a private collector.[CR]The object of the game was for one player to maneuver Kermit through the church and outside to a waiting taxi, without getting caught by Miss Piggy (controlled by the second player), who insisted that they be married.[CR]The obstacles to Kermit were the wedding guests (represented by blocks in the picture), who try to impede his progress through the maze. He also must touch a key in order to open the doors and escape, although if Miss Piggy touches the key, the doors close again.[CR]The most complete version currently known for this game was never finished, so the consequences of Kermit escaping or being caught by Miss Piggy are unknown. Additionally, Gonzo appears at the top of the screen as the minister, yet he has no purpose in the game prototype.</plot>

        <plot>Missile Control is a Missile Command-style game. The player has to defend their cities from incoming bombs fire by alien spaceships.[CR]The player controls a cursor on the screen which indicates the direction of fire for the defense missiles. Once launched, they travel in a straight line from the launcher through the point the player specified until they hit an object. Each level is won by destroying all alien spaceships. The player loses once all their cities are destroyed. Bonus cities can be obtained by destroying a sufficient number of alien spacecraft.[CR]The game gets progressively harder, for example bombs will fall faster and energy barriers might protect the aliens from the player's attacks. To get around the barriers, players can deflect their shots from large defense missiles launched at the sides of the screen.[CR]Other versions with a different title:[CR]Laaser[CR]Raketen-Angriff[CR] Star Force[CR]Select game 6, start the game, and let the game end. When it does, select the TV Type switch to pause the game, make sure the Right Difficulty is set to B, and press FIRE+UP. The initials LAV will appear where the 3 cities on the left stood.</plot>

        <plot>It’s well known that Atari wasn’t afraid to take risks when it came to developing new games. Some ideas were just too far out there to be marketable (such as Mindlink and Mind Maze), while others were just to niche to sell well enough (such as Mark of the Mole). Morse Code Tutor falls squarely into the latter category. Although I’m sure that there were indeed Morse Code enthusiasts who owned Atari 2600’s, they probably didn’t make up a large enough group to bother with. [CR]Little is known about the origins of this prototype or if Morse Code Tutor is even its real name. Found in a box of miscellaneous items from a former programmer, Morse Code Tutor is just what it sounds like: a program for helping the user learn to send and receive messages in Morse Code. It’s hard to believe that there would have been any market for something like this, but a similar program was released for the Videopac (Odyssey^2) system in Europe so there is some precedence. [CR]From the main screen you can select the Word Speed (5-72), Character Speed (5-72), and Pitch. Word Speed affects how fast the words you need to send appear, while Character Speed affects how fast the individual characters in the words appear. Pitch allows you to change the tone of the ‘beep’ that occurs each time you tap out a character. Pressing the button on the screen will produce a tone so you can test out your pitch level. [CR]After you’ve selected your options the only way to move on with the game is to move the left difficulty switch to the B position. This will produce a screen with some letters on it for you to try and signal. Moving the switch back to A will bring you back to the options screen. Pressing the reset button when on the Letters Screen will produce different combinations of letters, numbers, and eventually punctuation. The order is: 5 screens of letters (always in the same order), the entire alphabet, 3 screens of numbers (1-5, 6-0, then all the numbers), the entire alphabet with all the numbers, 3 screens of punctuation characters, then a screen with all the letters, numbers, and punctuation. This final screen is a bit different as it has a flashing cursor thst you can move and make letters disappear and reappear by pressing the button, but the use of this is unknown. After this screen pressing reset once more will bring up the word SEND, after that it will repeat back to the screens of letters. [CR]The prototype itself doesn’t seem to be complete, so there may be more functionality hidden in the code. Due to the small rom size (only 2K) and bare bones nature of the program, this would have been a very early release (1980 or earlier). It’s unknown if Atari was really planning on releasing Morse Code Tutor or if this was simply a toy created by a programmer playing around in his spare time. Either way Morse Code Tutor is one of the more unique programs in the 2600 library.</plot>

You sit proudly behind the wheel of your shiny blue rig, confident that you will roll right over that hotshot in the red truck. You'll make him wish he had never challenged you to this duel. A quick practice run shows you what to expect. There are death-defying jumps, cars to crush, walls to knock down, mud to plow through, and a variety of other obstacles, each as bad as the last. To be King of the Road, you will have to outscore your challenger in the most dangerous obstacle course ever devised. Only the best and bravest will win.</plot>

        <plot>Motocross is a motorcycle racing game viewed from a top-down perspective. The player rides a bike against an endless number of opponents on a straight road, trying to avoid running into them. In addition, the player has to watch the amount of gas left in the tank. The fuel gauge can be restored by driving over fuel cans. The goal of the game is to overtake a specified amount of bikes. Once this is accomplished, a new "scene" starts, and the difficulty is increased.[CR]Other versions with a different title:[CR]Around the World[CR]Moto Cross[CR]Moto Crosss [CR]Motor Cross[CR]Motor Cycle[CR]Motorcross</plot>

        <plot>Bone-jarring off-road motorcycle racing in three events. You first must qualify in the Desert Scramble where you race across the desert avoiding the prickly cactus, desert creatures, rocks, etc., in a race of speed and time. Hit an object and your dirt bike slows down. Hit too many and you won't qualify for the next race. The Hill Climb is a torturous race up a switchback mountain full of obstacles. Speed is important but control is vital or you'll be out of the race. Qualify with a fast time and you're in the Beach Sprint against other qualifiers in an all-out dash for the championship.</plot>

        <plot>Deep in the heart of a mysterious mountain lies a rare golden crown enshrined within an ancient Temple. Guarded by the ominous Skull Spirit, only those who possess the power of the Flame Spirit may gain entrance. To release the elusive Flame Spirit, pluck over 1,000 diamonds from the cavern walls as you descend deeper and deeper into the abyss. It's eerie music and ghostly flashes lure you. Grab it and race to the Temple! At last - you're inside! Seize the crown and speed to the mountaintop before the rampaging Cave Bats steal back your treasure! Simple, right? Wait. Cave Bats can also steal back the Flame Spirit. And lurking within the depths of the mountain is a Giant Spider waiting to trap you in its web. Armed with only a flashlight and a thirst for adventure, you'll need nerves of granite to become Mountain King. C'mon - you're going down under!</plot>

There's a persistent shark who thinks that the treasure belongs to him, and he is after you! As if that were not enough to contend with, there's a big old octopus sitting right above your trove who keeps reaching down to check things out. There you are, shooting at the shark, fighting off the octopus tentacles, and you realize your oxygen supply is running low.

        <plot>Off Your Rocker is a simple game for one to four players. And it's a lot of fun. The objective is to repeat the color and sound patterns - using Joyboard or Joystick - that Rockin' Rollie creates on the screen.[CR]Off Your Rocker can also be played using a Joystick instead of the Joyboard.[CR]Use the Game Select level to choose the number of players (number will appear in upper left-hand score box.) Pressing the Joystick's "fire" button will tell Rockin' Rollie that you're ready to play. When he presents a pattern, you can take as long as you like to study it and make your first move. But once you have started, you only have five seconds between each following move. There are two ways to play:[CR]1. When the Left Difficulty Switch is in the A/Novice position, each player remains on The Joyboard or uses the Joystick until they fail to complete the pattern (at which point Rockin' Rollie will get a little on-screen surprise). The score is noted and the next player can take a turn on The Joyboard or the Joystick and a completely new pattern will begin.[CR]2. When the Left Difficulty Switch is in the B/Expert position, Off Your Rocker is played as a round-robin game. The first player gets on The Joyboard or uses the Joystick and repeats the pattern. The next player then takes their turn. Any player who is unsuccessful will be removed from the rotation. The score will flash to indicate whose turn it is.[CR]The Right Difficulty Switch does not affect game play. In either mode, after the 7th round, the patterns will get faster.[CR]Rockin' Rollie's pattern sequenced can be up to 99 color changes in length. If you somehow manage to complete the entire sequence of 99 (or get even close to it), you will probably have worked up quite a sweat. You might want to consider a shower before you start bragging about how well you've done.[CR]Before leaving the VCS arena, Amiga had sent its second game Off Your Rocker off to a company to have labels applied. Unfortunately, since Amiga had pulled the plug on its 2600 division, they didn't have the money to pay for labels, so the carts were kept by the label company. Years later the company sold the cartridges off as scrap to a company in Ohio called Pleasant Valley Video who slapped on a homemade, handwritten label and sold them to the 2600 community.</plot>

        <plot>Some say that the legend of grand master Kung Fu Lu is centuries old. It begins soon after the Great Wall of China was erected. Near the new wall stood an old, ugly wall in which spirits lived. The people wanted to tear the evil wall down, but were afraid. Kung Fu Lu was a young lad then who had been granted five lives. One day a mystical dragon appeared on the old wall and threw a ball directly at him. Lu swung his walking stick and smashed the ball back. Bricks shattered and magical objects bearing good fortune and special powers fell from the Wall. Kung Fu Lu tried to catch as many as he could. Lu discovered that the battle for wealth and fortune has a very costly price. If he missed the ball with his stick, he lost one of his lives. And guarding the Wall was a cunning blackbird whose task was to prevent Kung Fu Lu from smashing the bricks. Patient Lu tried again and again to shatter the bricks. Persistence pays and eventually he became skillful in destroying the brick wall. He moved through all four difficult challenges to gain the honorable position of Master. The legend tells us only those who have fortitude and determination can ever match the brilliance of Grand Master Kung Fu Lu.Are you one of the chosen?</plot>

        <plot>Once upon a time there were no video games. People actually read fairy tales for kicks. Well, the biggest hit around was the one aboutthree little piggies who were into building houses. Unfortunately, an unsavory character named Bigelow B. Wolf was into blowing them down. It was a real drag. Until now. Because, lo and behold, today we've got Oink! A video game that lets you lend those little guys a hand. It's wacky, it's wily. It's one heck of a way to block that bully's every breath. Why, it's so exciting, even if you hate oinkers, you'll still love Oink! Because in this game you can also be (heh heh) the Wolf!</plot>

        <plot>Panda Chase is a strange game where, controlling a panda, you must go through the different levels of the game looking for bamboo to recover its energy, which is lost every second.[CR]When the game starts, the panda will be in an open area, with several places to explore. As soon as you enter somewhere, you will appear in a new environment, be it a cave, forest or open field. Your objective will be to go through the obstacles and dodge the enemies to get your bamboo.[CR]When picking up a bamboo, the player will recover his energy and receive points. If you run out of points or lose your three lives, the game will be over.[CR]Apparently Panda Chase is not a prototype, the game was finished and marketed, which does not justify the graphics and various bugs that happen in the game.</plot>

        <plot>Parachute (aka Von Himmel durch die Hoelle) is a video game released in 1983 by Homevision for the Atari 2600. The game puts the player in the role of parachutist who is falling gently from the sky.[CR]In order to land safely, the player must evade aeroplanes, helicopters, birds and hot air balloons. After successfully navigating several screens that progressively increase in speed, the parachutist finally emerges near ground level. In order to achieve a safe landing, the player must simultaneously avoid touching the pacing guard at the bottom while positioning the parachuter on the ground. A higher point bonus is awarded if the parachuter lands near the center of the screen. After landing, the game begins again at an increased difficulty level.[CR]Parachute is one of a few Atari 2600 games to employ in-game background music. The main theme loops throughout the game while occasionally changing pitch. [CR]Other versions with a different title:[CR]Sky Drive[CR]Skydiver[CR]Vom Himmel durch die Hölle</plot>

The game clock starts at 8-00 and the game ends when the clock reaches 5-00. In a two player game, each player controls a pair of workers. The package will pass from one worker to the other automatically. In a four player game, each player controls one worker apiece and must use the fire button to pass the package as well place it on the conveyor belt.Handcar- A race to the finish line using railway handcars.

        <plot>Since Peek-A-Boo was intended for very young children the gameplay is very simple. The main character of this game (a cat named Smart Seymour) moves in and out from behind a square. Depending on the game selected the various elements of the game change slightly. The square may be a single block, a rectangle, or four colored squares. The cat may move far away from the square, or he may barely move half his body out. The cat may move rapidly in and out from behind the square, or he may stay behind the square. There are eight different types of games, each with a slightly different objective.</plot>

It offers relative protection with the building walls. The second phase has the enemy tanks crossing two bridges over a river, but there's practically no cover. In the third and final phase, it's an all-out battle with the phantom tanks aggressively charging in on the player's base and no obstacles to stop them.</plot>

        <plot>Pick 'n Pile is a Tetris-style puzzle game. On each level there are a variety of symbols arranged in columns on the screen. By moving the symbols around, you need to create columns which contain identical symbols; once all the symbols in a column are the same, that column disappears. Your goal is to earn points and complete the levels by making all of the symbols on the screen disappear. Occasionally, you may become stuck with a symbol that doesn't match anything onscreen; when this happens, you can call for an additional symbol to drop onto the screen. However, as the symbol which appears is random you may need to create quite a few symbols before the one you need appears. Each level has a time limit in which it needs to be completed; run out of time and you lose a life; lose all lives and the game is over.[CR]In addition to the regular symbols, there are also some special objects on the screen which may help or hinder your progress. These include bombs which destroy several symbols at once, blocks which may get in the way or be arranged to help out, death heads which diminish time more quickly, and flower pots which can't be moved.</plot>

You simply take a freshly baked cake from the oven and drop it on a platter which is moving on a conveyor belt. Top that with a cherry, and you will be rewarded for your artistic endeavors. You must stack them correctly however, or - splat! As your skill progresses, so does the conveyor speed, so keep your cool and try not to earn the dubious title of 'butterfingers.'</plot>

        <plot>This game is really three smaller games. You select what to play to choosing which character you want.[CR]For Captain Link Hogthrob, it is Chickenvaders. A Pigs in Space take in Atari's Atari 2600 version of Space Invaders. While exploring the planet Cluck, our intrepid hero was set upon by space chickens. Captain Link must destroy them before they make their way all the way to the planet. He does this by firing link sausages up at the chickens. But the chickens are not helpless. They are dropping space chicken eggs. If one hits Link, he will be turned into...a chicken! You also lose a life. From time to time, Gonzo flies across the screen top in his saucer. You can hit him for points also.[CR]Scoring[CR]Hitting a chicken on...[CR]Row one=10 points[CR]Row two=20 points[CR]Row three=50 points[CR]Row four=70 points[CR]Row five=100 points[CR]Hitting Gonzo=300 points[CR]Destroying all the chickens=1000 point bonus[CR]If you select First Mate Piggy, you play Pastaroids. Somehow, Piggy has been ejected from the Swinetrek into a pastaroid storm. You must guide Piggy from the bottom of the screen to the top and board the Swinetrek before it leaves. If you touch a flying meatball or spaghetti strand, you will lose ground, and thus time. You can press fire to give a meat ball a karate chop for points but don't dawdle.[CR]Scoring[CR]Karate-chopping a meat ball=100 points[CR]Boarding the Swinetrek=1000 points[CR]If you select Dr. Strangepork, you play Escape from Planet of the Gonzoids. The Swinetrek has gotten trapped in an abandoned pizza mine still being guarded by robotic Gonzoids, created by Gonzo. The Gonzoids are standing on ledges, throwing pizzas across the mine, You have a weapon called the Boomeray. When you fire, it goes up then curves to the side, hopefully landing on a Gonzoid. The direction it curves depends on which way you move before you fire. If you are hit by a pizza, hit the mine walls or are hit by your dropping Boomeray shot, you lose a life.[CR]Scoring[CR]You get one point for every mile you get through the mine.[CR]Hitting a Gonzoid=100 points[CR]Escaping the mine=1000 points[CR]The difficulty switches do nothing. The only game selections are one player or two player, alternating.</plot>

        <plot>Here I am, Pitfall Harry, plummeting toward the dark thunder of rushing water below... and thinking of the night David Crane called. 'I hope you're well rested,' he had said. Too rested, I said. I was ready for action. He asked if I'd heard tales of the legendary lost caverns of Machu Picchu in Peru. Or of a roaring, uncharted underground tributary of the Urubamba River replete with waterfalls and deadly electric eels. 'Yes,' I said. He asked if I knew of the infamous, cursed Raj Diamond. Or of the recent robbery of gold bars from the U.S. Gold Bullion Depository in Fort Knox. And had I heard of vampire bats? Poisonous frogs? Albino scorpions? The dreaded Andean condor? 'Yes,' I said. And could I still run? Climb? Jump? Could I... swim? 'Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.' 'Good,' said Crane. 'Then you'll do it?' 'Of course,' I said. If only I had known...</plot>

        <plot>Let me introduce myself. I'm Pitfall Harry, veteran jungle explorer. Fortune hunting's my game, and yours, too, if you're daring enough to take this trip with me. Don't be nervous; I'll be your guide through the jungle, and I'm one of the best. Untold riches are waiting for us in there, but so are dangers a dozen times over. We'll be swinging on vines over bottomless tarpits. We'll be hopping across swamps, using crocodile heads like stepping stones. We'll be searching underground through dark passageways crawling with killer scorpions. So pack up your backpack and meet me at the jungle at dawn - and we'll be off to seek a king's ransom in gold, diamonds and lost treasures - in Pitfall Harry's Jungle Adventure.</plot>

        <plot>At its heart, Pizza Chef a memory/guessing game combined with a poorly programmed action game. The goal of the game is to correctly match up the proper kitchen utensil/food combination with the correct cooking pot before time expires. The overall concept has promise, but the execution is downright terrible. The game is separated into five different rooms: the dining room, the refrigerator, the kitchen, the storage room, and the trash room. Each room has it's own unique purpose and goal.[CR]This prototype is the only known NTSC prototype of Pizza Chef known to exist. The prototype was found with several other ZiMAG and Vidco prototypes.[CR]The carts with the handwritten stickers were sold by Pleasant Valley Video in Ohio.</plot>

        <plot>You play the role Col. George Taylor (who looks a bit like Pitfall Harry's long lost brother). Your mission is to guide Col. Taylor through a series of screens as he avoids an army of apes and makes his way towards the Forbidden Zone. There are three different kinds of apes in this game, and they all move in a straight line across the screen from right to left.[CR]For years Planet of the Apes had been misidentified as another 20th Century Fox prototype called Alligator People. This was because the first Planet of the Apes prototype was found in case labeled Alligator People and since no screenshots of either game existed, there was no reason to doubt the name on the label. However, after much research it was discovered that this game was in fact really John Marvin's lost Planet of the Apes game. It's obvious that Planet of the Apes still had some work to be done, but was finished enough to go through initial playtesting. However, before programmer John Marvin could finish it, he left 20th Century Fox to go work for Epyx. Since 20th Century Fox closed down its video game unit three months later, Planet of the Apes was never completed and released.</plot>

You can also shoot the phoenix(es) themselves for points.[CR]On the third screen, you must maneuver between parked ships, without hitting any, to dock at your spot at the top. Once you do this, the game goes to the first screen only harder.[CR]There are game selections to choose to also play only the first, second or third screens, with each wave getting harder.</plot>

        <plot>Description: 'Adam, Leader of the Lords, and Shaya, Queen of Power, are extra-terrestrial warriors who battle deadly aliens on the mystical Volcan Rock. Using lasers to fight the alien space serpent, the Power Lords can gain entry into the rock and search its endless chambers for the glowing touchstone that activates powerful anti-alien weapons and devices.'[CR]Power Lords was based on the 1983 toy line of the same name. North American Phillips (NAP) must have thought that it was going to be a huge hit, because games were developed for the Atari 2600, Colecovision and Odyssey 2. Of these games only the Odyssey 2 version was released and is considered to be the rarest US released game for the system. All three versions play similarly, but the Atari 2600 and Colecovision versions have an additional stage which makes the game slightly more interesting. Like the other versions, the 2600 version of Power Lords is not all that fun to play and the overall difficulty of the game is also rather high. Had Power Lords been released, it probably would have ended up in the bargain bin faster than the action figures did.</plot>

        <plot>Pursuit of the Pink Panther was based off the famous cartoon series and inspired by the Pink Panther movies starring Peter Sellers as inspector Clouseau. This game actually started out life as Trail of the Pink Panther by U.S. Games (based on the then current movie), but when U.S. Games went out of business they sold the rights to North American Phillips (NAP) who decided to release their own version of the game through their Probe 2000 division. It is unknown if any work was already done on the U.S. Games version or if any of those ideas were used in the Probe 2000 version of the game. Although Pursuit of the Pink Panther was heavily marketed at the June 1983 CES, it was never released, most probably because the special RAM/ROM chip that NAP used to squeeze all the graphics and gameplay elements into the game couldn't be reliably manufactured. When the first batch of chips came back defective from the manufacturer NAP decided to cancel the game rather than try and find a new source for the chips. The crumbling game market at the time was also a big factor in choosing not to go forward.[CR]Description: 'Players control the Pink Panther as he sneakily makes his way through several screens, attempting to outwit the Inspector. For his final challenge, he must dangle from a swinging rope, steal the famous Pink Panther diamond and escape unnoticed.'</plot>

However Roklan generally did not publish games under their own name, so most never knew they existed. However for some strange reason, they did publish their 8-bit titles under the Roklan name, which is where most people will recognize the name from (that and from their famous fading labels).[CR]Getting back to the 2600, Roklan developed at least four games for the Atari 2600 but two were never published. You've probably played Crazy Climber and Gorf, and maybe you've played the unreleased RealSports Basketball, but there was a fourth title that people didn't know existed until now.[CR]Racer was Roklan's first title for the Atari 2600, and as such, is a rather simple game. The player controls an strangely phallic shaped car which they must maneuver around the screen and avoid crashing into the walls. The screen scrolls downward, so you are constantly moving forward. As such there is no gas button, nor is there a brake button. All you can do as hang on and dodge those walls![CR]At the start of the game, the walls move rather slowly. In fact it is almost impossible to crash into a wall unless you're trying to do it on purpose. However about every 30 seconds the game will speed up, and the walls will come faster and faster until they become unavoidable to anyone who isn't a Jedi. This usually happens around the fifth speed up.[CR]Each player starts with three lives, with extra lives being awarded every 30 points. There are ten different game variations, each one changing the number of players and the speed at which the game starts. The last two variations are a sort of 'Children's Mode' where the game starts at the slowest speed and never speeds up.[CR]Although the one player version of Racer is rather ho-hum, the game really shines in the two player modes. Unlike most Atari 2600 games, Racer offers two player simultaneous play. In the two player variations you and a friend square off against one another in an attempt to get the highest score. Each player can stay on their side of the screen and try to beat the other player purely based on skill, but why would you want to do that? The best part of Racer is that you can bang and crash into the other player, forcing them into the oncoming walls. Of course the other player can do the exact same thing back to you, so be careful. Careful strategy is needed when deciding what the right time is to ram you car into the other player.[CR]While Racer is an alright game, it lacks long term playability. The one player game is too simple and ends too quickly, and the two player game isn't much more interesting. It was probably for this reason that Atari declined to pick up Racer, and Roklan didn't try and put it out themselves. Racer has potential, but it needs more variation to make it interesting (different wall layouts, an enemy car , power ups, etc.). Still, Racer is a rare and interesting glimpse into the secret lives of third party developers.</plot>

Uh-oh, here comes that blitzing linebacker. Do you run or pass? Quick, decide! Ah, there, your receiver is free. Hurry, the clock's running out.</plot>

Mining dangers plus security needed to safeguard crystal shipments required the creation of the most complex computer-controlled robotics system ever devised. This system had been doing a tremendous job. But... something is wrong. Crystal shipments have stopped, and returning crystal freighters have been destroyed by Terra I's own planetary defense system...</plot>

        <plot>Perhaps it was a form of protest against bottled ketchup, or maybe they were provoked by acid rain. Previously harmless garden tomatoes started turning into cold-blooded killers. Big beefsteak tomatoes started flying about rudely splattering innocent bystanders. No weapon known to man could prevent those vicious veggies from multiplying. Just when all seemed hopeless, someone suggested that since the plants could not be destroyed, they should just be trapped behind brick walls. Now the question is, can enough walls be built in time to stop the tomatoes from taking over the world? Find out before it's too late!</plot>

        <plot>Robin Hood is an action game where you need to rescue Maid Marian who is being held by the Sheriff of Nottingham in a castle (and while you're at it, steal some gold to give to the poor)! Gameplay takes place on several different screens which have different objectives. First you will need to make your way through Sherwood Forest; numerous henchman are hiding here, so use your arrows to shoot them. Surviving the forest, the next section takes place outside of the castle; naturally, numerous henchman guard the castle gate. While dodging incoming arrows, you need to shoot enough of the henchman to cause the gate to open. Once it opens, you can enter the castle for the final scene. Inside the castle you will be able to find Maid Marian behind one of the many doors, and gold behind another. The rest of the doors have henchman hiding behind them, but if you can find the Maid Marian or the gold then you win this round and the game repeats at a tougher skill level.</plot>

        <plot>Our nation's defense system has become computer controlled by robotic regulation. Human intervention and interference have been reduced to a scant minimum. It has proven to be a brilliant concept with a fail-safe design. But, suddenly, something has gone haywire. At one of the Western test sites, a division of armed tanks, the ROBOT TANKS, has stopped obeying commands from Computer Central and is now on the rampage. Thundering over western terrain, blistering everything in sight, they are moving closer to downtown Santa Clara. You must command your own sophisticated Robot Tanks from a remote station and STOP this nonsense. It'll require plenty of stamina, razor-sharp wits and strategic flexibility. Your control panel will monitor the damage to your machines, but you'll have to battle alone. Alone, against the robots.</plot>

        <rom name="No_Intro_Sept_2016/No_Intro_A1.zip/Rocky%20%26%20Bullwinkle%20%28USA%29%20%28Proto%29.zip" size="3303"/>
        <plot>According to the catalog entry: "Rocky and Bullwinkle must stop the evil Boris and Natasha from robbing a train full of priceless valuables. While Boris uses "Upsidasium" to float the valuables up to Natasha's waiting helicopter, Rocky must fly around and intercept them. When Rocky catches the valuables, he gives them to Bullwinkle for safe keeping." Now I know the show didn't exactly make sense most of the time, but what heck were the guys over at Mattel smoking when they came up with this plot? [CR]Twisted plot aside, Rocky and Bullwinkle is an interesting action game in which you must fly Rocky around the screen grabbing all the valuables before they float up to Natasha. R&amp;B; sort of plays like Kaboom in reverse, and resembles Dumbo's Flying Circus in some respects. Treasures can be snagged by flying Rocky over them and pressing the button, but since Rocky has puny little rodent muscles he can only hold two valuables at once. While you can give any treasure to Bullwinkle for points, there is a special combination that is displayed on the screen, these are the two that actually count. If you give these two treasures to Bullwinkle the screen will flash a bit and the timer will reset to 75, giving you more time to look for the next combination. However there's another timer which constantly counts down no matter what you do. When this timer runs out, the game ends. This timer can be extended by selecting different game variations. [CR]While you're zipping around the screen Natasha will occasionally drop something out of her plane which looks like a row of brown dots (bullets?) which will cause you to fly out of control for a few seconds if they hit out. Other than Natasha there's really nothing in this game that can harm you, but since this was a kiddie game it wasn't exactly supposed to be violent. Bullwinkle will occasionally drop a brown box of some sort which allows Rocky to carry six treasures instead of 2. The left difficulty switch affects how many treasures you need to give to Bullwinkle (one or two), while the select button changes Rocky's control scheme. Normally Rocky simply moves left, right, up, and down with the joystick as you would expect, but by pressing the select button you can put him in loop mode (indicated by the arrows at the bottom of the screen). While Rocky is in loop mode pressing up or right will cause him to do a right loop (the long you hold it down the further he goes into the loop), and pressing left or down will cause Rocky to do a left loop. While this control scheme may sound difficult, it becomes second nature after a few minutes. [CR]As if the game wasn't strange enough, you can change the shapes into numbers and mathematical symbols by putting the TV Type switch to B&amp;W.; This makes the game a bit more challenging because now the player must add or subtract the numbers they catch to equal the number Bullwinkle is displaying (ack! edutainment!). In this mode the left difficulty switch controls the difficulty of the numbers (1 or 2 digits). As with the treasure variation, you can give other numbers to Bullwinkle for points, but they don't count towards the solution. This variation also lacks the 'storage box' that is present in the treasure variation. [CR]The amazing thing about this prototype isn't the gameplay, it's the graphics. It's simply amazing how many items are moving on the screen at one time with absolutely no flicker. The train circles the bottom of the screen puffing smoke, Bullwinkle circles around the sky in his plane, Natasha moves back and forth in the helicopter (shooting at Rocky), and tons of valuables constantly move up the screen. All of this action actually makes it the screen a bit busy, which has to be a first for any 2600 game. [CR]The 2600 version of Rocky and Bullwinkle was actually designed before the Intellivision version, instead of the other way around as was usually the case. Even though Rocky and Bullwinkle was complete and passed quality assurance, it was canceled for unknown reasons. The Intellivision version was still on schedule to be released, but Mattel closed their doors before it could be completed. The rom file for this game exists, but has never been publicly distributed due to copyright reasons.</plot>

        <rom name="No_Intro_Sept_2016/No_Intro_A1.zip/Rush%20Hour%20%28USA%29%20%28Proto%29.zip" size="3092"/>
        <plot>Ever been stuck in a traffic jam? Haven't you always wished you could just floor it and zip in and out of traffic, blowing up all the cars that were in your way? While you may not be able to do it in real life (not without a lengthy jail sentence anyway), here's one game that will let you live out your fantasy on the 2600. Rush Hour is one of the long lost Commavid games that everyone assumed existed somewhere. Not only was Rush Hour advertised in catalogs, but prototype boxes had already been produced hinting that the game was almost finished. Sadly Rush Hour, along with Underworld and Mission Omega, never made it to store shelves before Commavid folded. [CR]Rush Hour is a driving/action game similar to Spy Hunter, but turned on its side. Your goal is to zip in and out of traffic on a five lane highway, and destroy the five car carriers that are causing the traffic jam. Your car comes equipped with two laser headlights (they come standard with the deluxe package), which you can use to shoot any cars that get in your way. However once a car is destroyed it will turn into a deadly pile of debris which cannot be destroyed. You can avoid the debris by changing lanes, but since this is rush hour finding an open space can be difficult. Alternatively you can also burn cars to a crisp with your red-hot exhaust (I'm sure the environmentalists just love your car), this is useful for those pesky cars that like to sneak up behind you. Also on the road you'll also see what appear to be oil slicks, but in this prototype the code to handle them is not present. [CR]As you zip in and out of traffic you'll undoubtedly get hit at least once. Thankfully your car is alot tougher than it looks and won't be instantly destroyed. However depending on the severity of the crash, your car will take some damage which will affect how it functions. The damage will be repaired over time, but you can also repair this damage by stopping on the top of the bottom of the road. However in the time it takes to repair your car, you may risk letting the carriers get away (as shown on the radar at the bottom of the screen). Interestingly there's a bug in the code that causes your car to get repaired past the normal limit (this was due to the programmer confusing hexadecimal with decimal notation). [CR]Once you've reached the carriers you must carefully watch and shoot each one as it unloads its car. Before a carrier unloads a car it will turn orange and flash briefly, it's during this time you must shoot. As you're shooting the carriers be careful to avoid the cars that are unloaded as crashing into one will almost certainly result in your untimely demise. Also take note that you only have one life in Rush Hour, lose it and it's game over. [CR]Although Rush Hour is playable, the prototype still has a bunch of bugs that needed to fixed before it was released. The most serious of these bugs is in the display routine, which will cause the screen to jump unexpectedly from time to time (especially when you reach the carriers). Other bugs include slight graphic and sound glitches, nonfunctional oil slicks, and inaccuracies in the radar. It seems the game was in the process of being debugged when the programmer was involved in a serious car accident (how's that for irony?). Due to this accident, Rush Hour was delayed and never completely finished. [CR]Commavid was always known for their interesting games, and Rush Hour is no exception. Rush Hour was one of the first games Commavid not programmed in-house; instead it was contracted out to an independent programmer. It appears that Commavid was finally starting to make some headway towards becoming a larger player on the 2600 scene; unfortunately the market crash put an end to those dreams.</plot>

        <plot>Both a NTSC and PAL prototype version have been found and the game appears to be complete. It was originally planned to be a cassette game for the Power Module peripheral, and is one of the games designed for use with The Joyboard controller. It was later planned to be one of four games on the fifth Power Play Arcade cart. According to a press kit, this was to be a first person flying simulation with a true 'through the cockpit' viewpoint and featuring both land and sea game variations. Catalog description: 'You're guiding your plane through a routine surveillance mission when suddenly, you're surrounded by enemy bombers and fighters. But they've seen you first. And you'd better think fast. You squeeze off a few rounds, just to let them know it isn't going to be easy. You pull back hard on the stick, and head straight for the sky. It's not going to be easy for you either...'</plot>

        <plot>Save Mary is an Atari 2600 action game that revolves around creating platforms to save Mary, the damsel in distress. The character is a humble construction worker who must pick up crates to use as platforms to get Mary to climb up, eventually leading to the top of the valley. The villain of the story is a mustachioed fiend who keeps Mary at the bottom of the valley for his own perverse pleasure.[CR]The player controls a crane at the top of the valley that moves picks up crates when the button is pressed. Bonus items can be picked up for extra points. The level can be restarted in the following ways:[CR] - The water reaches above Mary's head[CR] - A crate is knocked into/dropped on Mary[CR] - Mary is dropped from a high place.[CR]There is no definite ending, since once all the levels are completed, the game starts over. Therefore, the game loops on into eternity. Save Mary was in production for over 2 years, longer than any other Atari 2600 game.</plot>

        <plot>After much rumor and speculation about its existence, a prototype for this game was finally found in early 2002. Save the Whales had long been rumored to have been playable on the short-lived Gameline network, although nobody could actually remember playing the game. Was it worth the wait? Did it live up to expectations? Not really.[CR]You control a submarine that must "Save the Whales" by shooting the harpoons or nets thrown by the ship at the top of the screen. You can choose between harpoons or nets by changing the difficulty switch, harpoons are smaller and faster than the nets so they're harder to hit. If a harpoon or net hits your sub you'll have some damage, if you take five hits it's game over and all the whales die!</plot>

        <plot>Put on your swim fins and get ready to dive into adventure! But be careful because your search for the treasure of the sunken Spanish galleon is filled with danger. Man-eating fish and vicious sea monsters infest the waters where you must dive! And you have only 60 seconds worth of oxygen for every dive! You can use your harpoon gun to destroy the man-eating fish so you can enter the sunken ship and recover the 3 treasure chests filled with gold dubloons and pieces of eight. But watch out for the hungry sea monsters that guard the treasure. They are pledged to destroy all strangers who dare to enter their watery domain. And be very, very careful not to get close to the sticky walls of the treasure ship - or you may remain forever a prisoner of that watery hold!</plot>

        <plot>Shooting Arcade is one of only two 2600 games to use the light gun (Sentinel was the other), but was never released. This is a shame because Shooting Arcade is a creative light gun target game similar to the Point Blank series, and would have been unique among 2600 games. Interestingly it appears that Shooting Arcade was not developed in the US, but rather in Mexico by a company called Heuristica. How Axlon was invovled is unknown, but they may have simply sub-contracted the game out to Heuristica instead of doing it themselves.[CR]Shooting Arcade is really made up of six different scenes that are put together in different orders depending on the level you've selected. Each scene has its own unique theme, rules, and objective, making Shooting Arcade essentially six games in one. Depending on which skill level you choose, the scene's attributes change to make it more or less difficult and the timer at the bottom of the screen counts down more or less quickly. The status bar at the top of the screen shows the number of shots you have left, your current difficulty level, and the number of targets left. You start each level out with a limited amount of ammunition depending on the difficulty level (40, 10, 5, 2, or 1). You can continue from the last screen you completed an infinite amount of times by simply pressing the reset button. This is a handy feature as the game get very hard at the later levels...</plot>

        <plot>An unreleased prototype of the classic arcade title.[CR]The player pilots a lone spacecraft, and must create "Sinibombs" by shooting at drifting planetoids and catching the crystals that are thereby released. Sinibombs are needed to defeat the game boss, Sinistar, an animated spacecraft with a demonic skull face. Sinistar does not exist at the start of the game, and is continuously under construction by enemy worker ships. Though time is crucial, attempting to mine too quickly will destroy a planetoid without releasing any crystals. At the same time, enemy worker ships are also gathering crystals (often stealing them from the player) which they use to construct the Sinistar. Meanwhile, enemy warrior ships can also directly attack the player's ship. The player is given a head-start before the enemy ships have enough crystals to begin construction. Game ends when the player's ships are all destroyed.</plot>

        <plot>A damsel in distress is being held in a castle by a fire breathing dragon! As Sir Lancelot, you need to ride your winged horse Pegasus to the rescue. Each level in this action game consists of two screens. First you are outside the castle which is guarded by numerous flying creatures. You need to fly around the screen and destroy all of the creatures by hitting them with your lance (careful, if they hit you instead you'll lose a life). After all of the creatures are gone, you enter the second screen which is inside the castle. Here there is a large pit of lava and a flying dragon. To destroy the dragon you need to hit it's stomach with your lance. If you are hit by one of the dragon's fireballs you'll be temporarily stunned and unable to fly. If you end up falling into the lava, you'll lose a life. If you can defeat the dragon, the game repeats at a higher difficulty level. The game ends when you lose all of your lives.</plot>

        <plot>Programmer Jim Collas confirmed that this game was called Heart Like a Wheel and was based on the 1983 movie of the same name. 20th Century Fox had contracted a company called Micro Computer Technologies to create a game to tie in with the movie. Unfortunately the movie didn't do so good and the game was cancelled.[CR]Heart Like a Wheel was never completely finished before being cancelled. While the core gameplay is there, the prototype is missing some finishing touches such as correct level progression, the races starting automatically, and more tracks. Although Collas never went on to develop any more VCS games, he had a long and successful career in the computer industry including becoming President of Amiga during Gateway’s ownership of the brand.</plot>

        <plot>One of the first skateboarding-based video games, you have five minutes to get from your front steps to the steps of the school.[CR]The player must locate and successfully negotiate thirty hidden tricks in the form of ramps and pipes within a time limit. To save time it is possible to skitch on the back of moving vehicles. The fire button makes the player jump, which is necessary for remounting the skateboard after falling off. Jumping can also be used to get past hurdles. Continuing to hold the fire button results in a crouch, needed for passing through pipes.[CR]Additional challenges include finding the most efficient route through the maze and avoiding various obstacles that slow the player down.</plot>

        <plot>Sky Diver is an action game for two players. The goal is to score the most points by jumping from a plane, opening your parachute, and guiding your sky diver safely to a landing pad. The longer you wait to open your parachute, the more points you earn for a successful landing, but don't wait too long or your chute won't open at all! For each jump, there will be varying wind conditions which blow your sky diver off course. A wind sock at the bottom of the screen will help you determine the wind speed and direction so you can compensate. There are nine jumps total, and the player with the most points at the end wins.</plot>

        <plot>Sneak 'n Peek is a 1 or 2 player hide and seek game, with 4 variations of the basic game and 2 levels of difficulty to increase your enjoyment and test your skill. Sneak 'n Peek is played in and around a spooky old house with a large yard and 3 weird rooms. Each room, including the yard, is a separate scene, and contains up to 5 hiding places. Some of them are in really strange places, and some of the locations can change depending on the game you select. The game always begins in the living room with player 1 standing in the corner and covering his eyes. Player 2 may sneak to any of the 5 hiding places in the living room or exit through the door to another scene. A timer keeps track of how long it takes the player to hide. If a friend isn't available to play, the computer will be happy to hide from you. It knows all of the hiding places and is very sneaky.</plot>

        <plot>You left Planet Earth just moments ago for routine moon-based primary-satellite scout duty. You are commanding a squadron consisting of 3 heavily-armed Mark 16 Starcruisers. Suddenly you are attacked by alien enemy raiders energizing from the ether... obviously molecularly energized from a distant galaxy. They fire neutron missiles which will destroy your Starcruiser upon impact. Your mission is to destroy the alien enemy ships until reinforcements can arrive from Planet Earth. These arrive at the approximate rate of one Starcruiser every 10,000 points. The enemy's arsenal also consists of Lazer-Directed Heat-Seeking Proton Missiles which are fired sparingly.</plot>

Then you walk or climb through the Ice Cap, dodging avalanches and the Abominable Snowman. Finally, you walk to the peak and plant your flag.[CR]Along the way, you score points by reaching higher altitudes, collecting gold and ice diamonds, and killing the Snowman with your ice pick. Getting hit by rocks or avalanches can take away points. Every hundred thousand points, you get an extra life, for a maximum of three.</plot>

        <plot>Fireball is an arcade action game similar to Breakout. The player controls a juggler who needs to keep multiple fireballs within the play field. The juggler can hold on to two fireballs at a time, so be careful because if he tries to catch a third it will fall off the screen. The goal is to destroy the bricks at the top of the screen by hitting them with the fireballs. When all the bricks are destroyed, the player moves on to the next round and is given one additional fireball to keep in play. Five different game variations are included:[CR] Firetrap: Two additional fireballs are trapped within brick walls. Once a hole forms in the walls, the player will also need to keep these additional fireballs in play.[CR] Marching Blocks: In this game, each time the player catches a fireball, the rows of blocks will drop down one level. From time to time, a mystery fireball may also appear.[CR] Knock-A-Block: This is the most basic game variation. There is a solid wall of blocks at the top of the screen that the player needs to destroy.[CR] Migrating Blocks: In this game, the rows of blocks move. Every few seconds each row of blocks will rotate either to the left or to the right.[CR] Cascade: There are five additional fireballs trapped within the block formation. When the player destroys enough blocks to release an extra fireball, it too will need to be kept in play.</plot>

Your mission is to shoot down enemy planes, shoot enemy ammo dumps (they look like little black houses) and enemy anti-aircraft guns (they kinda look like sundials). If you fly down too long, you will get a low altitude warning. If you don't correct, you will crash. You can also be shot down by anti-aircraft guns and enemy planes. Push left and right to go those directions but push up to go down and down to go up. Push the fire button to fire machine guns.</plot>

        <plot>Space-security approaches the abandoned asteroid Stronghold, activating a volley of defense drones. Skillfully you must pilot your attack ship through the explosive space-waste; a single scrape will pierce the skin of your fragile ship. Without warning the bleak surface of the heavily-fortified Stronghold is energized by three moving force shields that protect a lethal asteroid crawler. The automatic systems of the seemingly derelict Stronghold are functioning perfectly, heat sensor interceptors launch to track and destroy your spacecraft. Survival depends on blasting through the whirling force shields and devastating the crawling command center as it fires repeatedly trying to eliminate your frail ship.</plot>

Enemy submarines, that have embarked on a suicide mission that will deal a death blow to our fleet. And only the Captain of one destroyer can stop them now. With an eye on the radar screen and a finger on the trigger, you frantically steam back and forth across the surface, laying down one depth charge pattern after another. The ping of the sonar fills the night. The sound of exploding depth charges fills the ocean, as you pick off one submarine after another, hoping you've picked the perfect moment to sink the glowing nuclear subs.</plot>

        <plot>You're a helicopter gunship pilot on a daring and dangerous mission: air surveillance of enemy territory. Success depends on how far you can penetrate enemy airspace. Can you handle the pressure? Because the further you go, the more difficult the mission becomes. Show that you've got what it takes by maneuvering your chopper around craggy mountain peaks, through deep dark tunnels, and over tall city buildings. All while you face enemy tanks and missiles and weird sky-flying weapons. But you can fight back with high-flying, quick-thinking, fast-reaction moves. Good luck and good flying!</plot>

When you're playing against another person, he can pick his own defensive plays. After four downs, he calls the play and you, 'hold that line', or rush the quarterback.

        <plot>Surf's Up was the third and last game to make use of Amiga's JoyBoard controller. The JoyBoard was a quirky device that you would stand on and lean in the direction you wanted your character to move. An interesting concept, but it didn't work overly well and only one officially released game (Mogul Maniac) made use of it. While Amiga's second game Off Your Rocker was sold in limited quantities through Happy Valley Video, Surf's Up was never sold in stores.</plot>

        <plot>In [I]Surfer's Paradise[/I], the player's objective is to stay on top of a wave as long as possible. From time to time, a shark will approach the player who can in turn jump to try to avoid the shark. If they fail or if they don't manage to stay on top of the wave, they will drop into the water.[CR]The underwater sequence makes up the second part of the game. Here, the player has to get from the left side of the screen to the right side and back onto their surf board. However, there's a sunken galleon in their way. The player has to navigate a maze of walls in a limited amount of time while also avoiding oncoming jellyfish.[CR]Once the player reaches the top of the board, a new and more difficult round starts. Scoring is achieved by staying on top of the wave as long as possible. Extra lives are awarded for every 1000 points.</plot>

        <plot>Sweat! was to be Starpath's version of Activision's Decathlon for the Supercharger. Given the fact that the Supercharger allowed for more memory and larger games, Sweat! probably would have been an amazing game had it been completed. Of course this never happened as the video game market was crumbling rapidly and people weren't spending money on regular video games, much less games that required special hardware. It was around this time that the financially troubled Starpath merged with Epyx. Most of Starpath's programmers transferred over to Epyx and used Sweat!'s game concept to create Summer Games.</plot>

Wave after wave of laser-firing Ahmins, against your five starfighters of Bravo Squadron. The glare of laser cannons pierces the darkness of space as your squadron shrieks overhead in tight formation at 24 times the speed of sound. Your ships can fire almost 300 rounds a minute. But only lightning reflexes and a sharpshooter's eye can save you as the Ahmins fly faster and faster. But a word of caution. Don't miss the enemy's shimmering mother ships.

        <plot>Telepathy is one of two known prototype games that were developed for Atari's failed Mindlink controller. The Mindlink was a headband that player wore on his head and plugged into the joystick port. The idea was that the Mindlink's sensors would pick up any facial movements or muscle twitches the player would make. Atari actually said that the Mindlink read the player's thoughts (sure it did...). The problem was that the Mindlink didn't work very well in initial test runs, and even when it did work players would complain of headaches and dizziness from twitching their face all day. After disappointing test results, the Mindlink controller was wisely canceled.[CR]Fortunately, this game is playable using a regular joystick controller.</plot>

        <plot>99 Hyperspatial Wireways have long been crucial to man's ability to travel quickly through space. Thus, when aliens invade them, it becomes necessary to fly into and clear them.[CR]Tempest is a shooter using wire-frame graphics. Each Wireway is taken on in turn, and has a network of lines guiding the movement paths of both yourself and the aliens. You remain on the outside and keep shooting as the aliens move towards you. Any that reach the outside are fatal to touch, thus limiting your range of movement greatly if 2 or more achieve this. Some aliens move sideways - in dealing with these, plan ahead allowing for the time your shots to take to travel.</plot>

        <plot>Thwocker was one of the long lost Activision prototypes that finally surfaced in 2001 when it was found a thrift shop along with some other prototypes. Like most other unreleased Activision games, Thwocker was never mentioned in any catalogs or announced at any gaming expos. Apparently Activision liked to keep their games secret until they were sure it was going to be released. Not a bad policy. [CR]In Thwocker, the object is to gather the musical notes in the correct order as indicated in the status area, while also avoiding the flying musical instruments. To control your bouncing character, move the joystick left or right for direction, and move it up to increase the height of your bounce. Be sure to push up just when you bounce, don't press up continuously. Press and hold the fire button to decrease the height of your bounce (push the joystick down at the same time to decrease height even faster). Once you have collected the proper musical notes, grab the large note at the top of the level. At that point, a tune will begin playing and you can now grab all the remaining musical notes, as well as the musical instruments.</plot>

        <plot>Prepare for fierce aerial combat with aircraft that span the years since the dawn of aviation. Your timeship's first encounter is with ancient 1910 biplanes; you're outnumbered, but your weapons are superior. Eliminate the entire air fleet; then knock out a mighty zeppelin and you'll progress to the next stage: 1940 monoplanes. These World War II fighters present a tougher challenge, and if you can defeat them, you'll move on to 1970 helicopters. Down the choppers and warp ahead to meet 1983 super jets. If you find a way to beat them, you'll cross the final barrier and head into the future for a deep-space duel with deadly flying saucers from the year 2001!</plot>

There were several home versions of the original; the ZX Spectrum and Amstrad CPC versions were only released as part of the Game, Set and Match II compilation in 1988, and are poorly regarded by fans.</plot>

        <plot>As the name implies the Venetian Blinds demo isn't a game, but a demo that simulates a pair of Venetian blinds! The joystick can be used to raise and lower the blinds by pushing up or down. When the blinds are raised a nicely done sunset is visible out the window. [CR]The story behind the Venetian Blind demo is rather interesting. As most people know, Activision was founded by several ex-Atari employees who had left due to Atari's policies on programmer recognition (or the lack thereof). One of these employees was Bob Whitehead, creator of the "Venetian Blinds" technique, which was first used in Atari's Video Chess to display eight objects in a row instead of the normal six. Even though Activision had never used the Venetian Blinds technique in any of their games, that didn't stop Atari from threatening to sue Activision for "stealing" the technique along with other various proprietary information. [CR]Since Activision knew that they hadn't stolen anything from Atari, they decided to play a little joke on Atari. According to David Crane, when the Atari's lawyers questioned them about the "stolen" Venetian Blinds technique David showed them this demo and said "Is this what you guys are referring to?". Apparently Atari wasn’t in a laughing mood, and they went through with the lawsuit. In the end Atari ended up losing the case and Activision went on to become the most successful of the 2600 third party companies. [CR]Although Activision never made a game out of this demo it didn't go completely to waste. The sunset was later used in the background of Barnstorming.</plot>

        <plot>When you are ready to start exercising, step on the FOOT CRAZ ACTIVITY PAD GREEN dot. It starts the pace symbols moving around each track. [CR]There are two tracks displayed on the screen. To start moving the jogger figure, jog alternately on the ORANGE and SLUE dots on the FOOT CRAZ ACTIVITY PAD. The faster you jog, the faster the jogger figure moves around the track. Lap count, time and score are displayed on the bottom of the screen. Once around the track is equal to approximately thirty-five yards. [CR]To add variety and greater challenge to JOGGER, you may at any time, switch the jogger figure to the lower, faster track by stepping on the RED dot of the FOOT CRAZ ACTIVITY PAD, and back again to the upper, slower track by stepping on the YELLOW dot. [CR]JOGGER is more effective at the slower pace. The length of time jogging is more beneficial to your fitness than moving at sprint speed. [CR]Track laps are counted, giving JOGGER a competitive feature for increased family pleasure. After 2,000 points are accumulated, the pace syrnbol speed increases and challenges you to jog faster. [CR]Five minutes into your run, a second pace symbol appears on each track, making JOGGER even more spirited among participants. [CR]Bonus points may be earned by passing the pace symbol when it is GREEN. If you pass when it is RED, you lose a "life." JOGGER gives you three "lives" before the sequence needs to be repeated. There are four levels of difficulty. [CR]When you exercise on JOGGER, it is beneficial to remember that you are running in place. Maintain an erect posture and you will get more out of your workout. Make certain that you jog on the BLUE and ORANGE dots. [CR]JOGGER is an excellent trainer for those who want to begin a jogging program, or trim off pounds.</plot>

It affords you the opportunity to create a lifelong exercise program. Wherever you have a television set and an Atari 2600VCS, you have your own physical fitness center. Together, the entire family can enjoy the fun and fitness available through the patent-pending "FOOT CRAZ" and the lively "JOGGER" and "REFLEX" programs. [CR]There are five squares displayed on the screen, each with a different color. When you see a "bug" appear on one of the colored squares, you have a limited [CR]time (one to three seconds, depending on the level) to step on the corresponding colored dot of the FOOT CRAZ ACTIVITY PAD. To train your reflexes further, a "bug" can appear on more than one colored square at the same time. You get a point for each correct hit. The level of difficulty increases every twenty points. There are eight "lives" per program. A life is lost each time you step on the wrong color or delay too long in hitting the dot. You should not Step on a colored square when a BUTTERFLY appears, If do, it takes one of your "lives:' REFLEX is the ideal trainer for those participating in aerobics, jazzercise, tennis, soccer, football, track and field, and snow and water skiing.</plot>

        <plot>Wing War is a rather unique game that was only available in Europe, even though it was announced for the US market and is the only Imagic title that was not released in the US. The gameplay is a little like the classic arcade game Joust, except it's a bit more complex and involves a lot of exploration. A mystical dragon sets out to find crystals of fire, air, and water, in order to gain special powers, and eggs which will hatch into new dragons. The dragon must defeat enemies by shooting fireballs, which is accomplished by pushing the joystick upwards and in the direction the player wishes to shoot in. Some enemies can be killed with one shot, others with two, and some take more and more fireballs to be killed as the game progresses. What is truly unique about this game is that the fire and water crystals must never be dropped off consecutively, or else they will destroy one another. An air crystal must separate the two. Also, players must learn to conserve fireballs, otherwise they will find they have no way of defending themselves against their enemies. Wing War is a very unique game, and a shame it was never released in the United States.</plot>

        <plot>Wings is an unreleased game developed by CBS Electronics and programmed by Stuart Ross. Wings is an air combat simulation that uses a control scheme of two joysticks. The first joystick controls your plane and the second controls access to your weapons. It was originally assumed the game would use the CBS Booster Grip controller, due to a prototype box that shows Wings packaged with the controller. Wings features a fairly sophisticated control panel (for a 2600 game), containing seven different gauges that let you keep tabs on your fuel, power, airspeed, altitude, radar, horizon, and compass. [CR]Two different versions of the prototype binary exist, one NTSC and one PAL. The NTSC version of the game is dated four months earlier than the PAL version, and is noticeably different. The NTSC version is playable, but is missing the enemy planes and has numerous bugs. The PAL version is more complete, featuring a nice Wings logo and enemy planes, but also contains a bug that causes the game to crash if you continually pull back on the joystick while taking off. In addition, some of the gauges in the PAL version are not function.</plot>

        <plot>Wizard is a video game created in 1980 for the Atari Video Computer System (later renamed the Atari 2600) by Chris Crawford while working for Atari, Inc. The game was not advertised or released by Atari. Wizard uses a 2K ROM, the last Atari 2600 game developed by Atari with less than 4K. Wizard was eventually released as part of the Atari Flashback 2 package in 2005.[CR]The player is a wizard from Irata (Atari spelled backwards) and battles imps in a maze. It's not a symmetric battle: the player is faster than the enemy, but the enemy can go through walls and fire faster than the player can. There is no need to aim, as the angle of the player's fire is automatically sent in the direction of the enemy. The enemy remains invisible when it is behind a wall. It also has heart beat audio, which becomes louder as the player gets closer to the enemy.[CR]The production of Wizard is detailed extensively in the book Chris Crawford on Game Design. Crawford wanted to write software for the new Atari home computers, but Atari management required developers for the system to create an Atari VCS game first.[CR]Wizard was never released for the Atari VCS. It was first released on the Atari Flashback 2, 25 years after it was written. Its developer, Chris Crawford, was not even told about Wizard's eventual release on the Flashback 2, and learned about it in an email from a fan. Crawford's original prototype did not contain a two-player mode, but the game released with the Atari Flashback 2 does.</plot>

        <plot>A band of hostile aliens has infested your planet's nine space stations. The security of the entire solar system is at stake. It's up to you and your elite security force to destroy the alien pests and regain control of the space stations. If you fail to save a station, you can still destroy the aliens by blowing up the space station. Just find the secret code and take it to the destruct console. Then hightail it out of there! Each space station contains as many as 5 levels. Search each level for abandoned equipment and food. Swap your Phaser for more powerful weapons to help you blow away more alien fiends!</plot>
