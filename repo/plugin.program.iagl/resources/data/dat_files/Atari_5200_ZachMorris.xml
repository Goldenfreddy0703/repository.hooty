		<emu_comment>The Atari 5200 SuperSystem, commonly known as the Atari 5200, is a video game console that was introduced in 1982 by Atari Inc. as a higher end complementary console for the popular Atari 2600. The 5200 was created to compete with the Intellivision, but wound up more directly competing with the ColecoVision shortly after its release. The 5200 was based on Atari Inc.'s existing 400/800 computers and the internal hardware was almost identical, although software was not directly compatible between the two systems. The 5200's controllers feature an analog joystick and a numeric keypad along with start, pause and reset buttons. The 360-degree non-centering joystick was touted as offering more control than the four-position joystick controller offered with the Atari 2600.[CR]Developer:  Atari[CR]Manufacturer:  Atari[CR]CPU:  MOS 6502C[CR]Memory:  16 KB[CR]Graphics:  Alphanumeric Television Interface Controller[CR]Sound:  Pot Keyboard Integrated Circuit[CR]Display:  320x192[CR]Media:  Cartridge[CR]Max Controllers:  2</emu_comment>

        <plot>A port of the classic computer game, A.E. (Which stands for Anti Environmental) is a most unusual 5200 prototype. It was never announced by Atari nor was it mentioned in any internal documents. A.E. is an arcade style shooting game in which you have to shoot down waves of evil flying mechanical stingrays in order to save your planet.[CR]The Atari 5200 version only has four levels as opposed to ten that the computer versions boast. The loading times for the levels are also longer due to hardware constraints of the Atari 5200.</plot>

        <plot>Trapped in space somewhere between the planets Ortanus and Earth, your ship is suddenly surrounded by a field of massive asteroids. And, as if that weren't enough excitement for one day, a group of alien saucers stage a surprise attack. Quickly you take over the controls to save your ship from imminent doom. You must thrust away from the path of the oncoming asteroids. Put up shields to protect the ship. Hyperspace into thin air. Flip over and get the asteroids attacking from behind. It's all in your hands now. Good luck![CR]Thought to have been planned to be a launch title for the Atari 5200 system due to the catalog number of CX5201. However it was never officially released but the prototype was found eventually. It's very similar to the Atari 8-Bit version of the game but unfortunately the controls are pretty poor with the 5200 joystick. There was an official controller that was planned to be released along with the game but sadly this was not to be.[CR]This is a homebrew port of the 8-bit computer series and was never officially released on the Atari 5200 platform.</plot>

        <plot>Barroom Baseball is an interesting prototype in that it was never intended for home use. As the name suggests Barroom Baseball was a special version of Realsports Baseball modified for use in 5200 arcade units. These special 5200's were modified to run off of a coin operated timer and were intended for use in bars and in Latin American countries where such machines were popular. It is unknown if any of these units were actually produced, but according to internal company memos at least one may have been field tested. To date no other specially modified games have been found.</plot>

        <plot>An unreleased port of the arcade game Battlezone for Atari 5200. Like the arcade game you drive a tank around and shoot enemy tanks while trying to avoid their fire in a 3d environment. It was unfortunately never released and only exists in prototype form. The prototype seems mostly finished but the hit detection seems off at times and not perfected. It also replaces some of the vector based graphics of the arcade with raster likely due to limitations of the Atari 5200. You can also play this with two joysticks which is said to help with controlling the game versus single if you get used to it.</plot>

        <plot>Blaster developed by Vid Kidz for Williams was released for the arcades and is quite obscure. What is interesting however is that the Atari 5200 version that was not released was actually made before the arcade game.[CR]An unofficial sequel to Robotron 2084 (As it takes place in 2085) Blaster is a 3d style shooter with impressive graphics for the time. In it the player takes the view from a spaceship cockpit so moving in the different directions shifts the entire screen. There are four levels you will play through avoiding obstacles, saving humans, and defeating alien enemies. Upon beating the four levels the game loops but will be more difficult.</plot>

        <plot>As the name implies, Boogie is not a game but a music demo. This prototype displays the 5200 splash screen while continuously playing a "boogie" tune. The music is somewhat interesting, and shows off the 5200's music abilities fairly well. It's unknown whether this prototype was made simply as a learning tool, or if some kind of music game was being planned.[CR]Additional info: Boogie Demo, Atari, Music, 1982. Boogie demo was coded by Atari for internal use as a demonstration of the audio capabilities of the Atari 5200. The cartridge plays an impressive little boogie, then repeats. There is no game or graphics here, just the title screen and the musical score</plot>

        <plot>Castle Blast is shoot'em up based on the 5th screen of Atari's 2600 Phoenix where you take on the mothership. Castle Blast is Ronen Habot's first foray into programming the Atari 5200. Ronen used this experience as a means to write a tutorial on Atari 5200 programming to assist others who might want to write games for the system.[CR]Castle Blast made its debut at the 2002 Classic Gaming Expo, where it was sold with a box, manual and cart. AtariAge held a Castle Blast Label Contest in April, 2002. Castle Blast may be ordered directly from the author, Ronen Habot, by visiting the Castle Blast Development Page.[CR]The object of this game is to destroy the Castle on the Mothership. You fire Vertical Trajectory Missiles, or VTMs, at the shield on the bottom of the Mothership. When you penetrate the shield, then blast the Castle. To score extra points, you can also shoot the enemy spaceships flying overhead.[CR]If you destroy the Castle, you advance to the next level, where you will need to contend with Focused Energy Beams, or FEBs, fired from the Mothership. There will also be stars appearing in the sky, making it harder to target the spaceships.[CR]If you manage to obliterate the Castle again, you will proceed to the next level, which adds ground-based tanks assaulting you. You have Horizontal Trajectory Missiles, or HTMs, to deal with this new enemy but do not lose sight of your primary goal.[CR]Your joystick moves you left or right. The lower button fires VTMs, the upper button fires HTMs.</plot>

        <plot>This is a battle on three fronts. You are the captain of the ship Legacy. Your ultimate goal is to destroy the Warmongers' missile bases but you must also protect your cities.[CR]You begin the game in command mode. You select your other modes with the joystick. Up for navigation, down for torpedo, left for sea-to-air and right for sea-to-land.[CR]Navigation[CR]In navigation mode, you will see an overhead map of the world. You will note that there is a black dot in a black circle. This is you and the circle represents your effective range. You move the circle about the screen to target ships or known missile bases or to refuel at a city. You use fuel only when you are in navigation mode. When you are within range, or if an enemy ships comes within your range, press the space bar to return to the command mode then change to the desired mode.[CR]Torpedo[CR]If you are within range of an enemy ship, switch to torpedo mode. In this mode, you will use the scanner at the bottom to line up your target. Move out of line to avoid a direct hit. Beware of war ship as they will chase you and have the most firepower. Hunter ships will also chase you. While their firepower is not as high as war ships, it is still fairly good. Intelligence ships have the weakest firepower and will not chase you. They can be found on the right side of the screen. If one is destroyed and there are any hidden missile bases, there is a eighty percent chance a hidden base will be revealed.[CR]Sea-to-land[CR]If you want to destroy a missile base or refuel, enter sea-to-land mode. To refuel, get near a city then enter this mode. When you are in sea-to-land mode, you will know you are within range if you see "Dock for refueling" on the screen. You then place the cross hairs on the base of the city and wait for refueling to complete, unless you or a city are under attack. Do not use the fire button to exit or you will fire on your city. To destroy a missile base, position your cross hairs using the scanner on the screen until you are on a missile launcher then fire. Be advised that when you fire on a missile base, they will shoot missiles at a city.[CR]Sea-to-air[CR]If a city is under attach, switch to this mode. You will control a weapons satellite. Use you joystick, or the trak-ball , if you plugged one into port 2, to aim at an incoming missile and press fire to blast it. If it gets past you but has not reached your city, you get a "Refocusing" message and the view switches to a short range view where you will get one more try.[CR]Be warned that ships can attack you no matter what mode you are in. On the easiest level, there are no hidden bases nor do you use fuel.[CR]The Atari 5200 version of this game was never released but is however mostly identical to the Atari 8-Bit version that was released.</plot>

        <plot>A prototype game that was never officially released for the Atari 5200, Frisky Tom is a port of the obscure Nichibutsu coin-op of the same name in which you play a plumber who must climb up and fix broken pipes to keep a steady stream of water flowing from the tank at the top of the screen to the reservoir at the bottom. Unfortunately this house is infested with mice which roam the screen, gnawing through pipes and generally causing problems for our man Tom.[CR]Once a mouse gnaws through a pipe, you'll see the flow of water stop and a pipe piece will fall to the ground. To repair the pipe Tom must pick up the fallen piece (you can hold two pieces a time), and put it back into the hole. To get to where the holes are, Tom must carefully climb up and navigate the maze of pipes. Although Tom can cross short gaps in the pipes, he'll need to go around the larger ones. While climbing around on the pipes, Tom will run across several different kinds of mice. Each mouse has its own color and purpose.[CR]When the flow of water is interrupted, the timer in the reservoir will begin to count downward from 5000 at the rate of 100 points per second. The only way to stop this countdown is to restore the water flow by fixing the pipes. If the timer reaches zero, Tom will lose a life and play the current level over again. If Tom is able to get enough water into the reservoir (keeping the timer above 1500), he'll be rewarded with a bonus intermission showing a woman taking a shower.[CR]- Excerpt from www.atariprotos.com</plot>

        <plot>Jr.Pac-Man was never released for the Atari 5200, however a prototype does exist. In this Pac-man spin off you now take control of junior who has to contend with much more than his parents did! The mazes are so large now they require the screen to scroll. On top of that the items that appear will cause the dots to enlarge. This gives Junior more points when he eats them but also slows him down a bit making it difficult to avoid the ghosts. What's worse is if they hit a power pellet they will destroy it![CR]Like other Pac-Man games intermissions are shown between levels. They mainly have to do with Junior and a ghost girl falling in love despite their parents disapproval.</plot>

        <plot>Koffi is a little kopter so when the emergencies came, the big kopters wouldn't let him go. But now he has heard that Pyro the thundercloud is using lightning to start fires in the forest. The fire needs to be put out, the animals need saving. Koffi wasn't allowed to help the big kopters but he can't just ignore this until they return.[CR]You, as Koffi, must gather water from the raindrops or snowflakes and destroy Pyro. You destroy him by bumping into him but watch out for his lightning. After Pyro is gone, you must hover close to the fire then press your button to release water to put out. If you don't have enough water, grab more raindrops or snowflakes but don't delay or the fire will rage out of control. You can get bonus points by shoving the animal under the trees off the screen. The forest areas are mountain valley, coniferous forest and windy vines, where you have to watch that you are not blown into lightning. After you clear the three forest areas, you must face Pyro's mom, and she is not happy that you beat up on her son. You kill her the same way as her son but she throws longer and faster lightning and there is an angry cloud moving up and down and slowly towards you. Once she is dead, you restart mountain valley at a harder level.</plot>

Yes, you've been recruited to help the Star League destroy Xur and his forces once and for all. To accomplish this, you'll have to travel to the Procyon system and destroy the Ko-Dan in their own galaxy. However, while you're off playing cowboy in a distant galaxy, the Ko-Dan armada are planning their own attack on your home system of Celos IV. So not only must you defeat the whole Ko-Dan empire single handed, you must also defend your galaxy at the same time. Accomplishing both tasks at once is all about strategy, sharp shooting, and a little luck. [CR]The Last Starfighter is based on the 80s movie. Unfortunately despite being finished it wasn't released for the Atari 5200. However it does exist in prototype form and was eventually officially released for the Atari XE/XL as Star Raiders II with some minor changes. Also an arcade version was supposed to be released but was canned as well. On top of all that this game wasn't even originally The Last Starfighter and instead was originally called Orbiter that was retooled. Quite a history for a prototype!</plot>

There is an early build available of the shooter as well.[CR]You are a warrior named Meebzork who can practice or play through 6 different levels (not including another level that was going to be after you completed a board and would allow you to choose a next one). All 6 levels are different in what they require. While unfinished and unpolished you can see a lot of potential.</plot>

        <plot>An unreleased prototype game created by Steve Baker. Originally released for the Apple II he decided to port it to the Atari 5200 since it had a similar high resolution mode. Which only allowed it to be black and white. Luckily this is perfect for Backgammon!</plot>

        <plot>An prototype conversion of the arcade game Millipede. It was completed in 1984 but never released due to Atari abandoning the 5200 near it's completion. A homebrew version was released in 2017 by Atariage. [CR]The goal is to survive wave after wave of various insects while trying to destroy a Millipede that makes its way down the screen towards your player. While very similar to Centipede it adds quite a few new quirks such as new insects to contend with and DDT bombs that when shot will destroy what is around them.</plot>

        <plot>Unreleased prototype game by Steve Baker for the Atari 5200. However it was completed and is fully playable. Due to the Hi-Res mode used the game has some odd choices for colors but other than that is quite well done and simulates Miniature Golf very well. [CR]Control is handled entirely by the keypad, so the non-centering 5200 joystick doesn't hinder the gameplay. Pushing the # and * keys changes the direction the ball will be hit (represented by an arrow) and the 1-9 keys are used to indicate the power of the swing (1=lowest and 9=highest).</plot>

        <plot>Let me introduce myself. I'm Pitfall Harry, veteran jungle explorer. Fortune hunting's my game, and yours, too, if you're daring enough to take this trip with me. Don't be nervous; I'll be your guide through the jungle, and I'm one of the best. Untold riches are waiting for us in there, but so are dangers a dozen times over. We'll be swinging on vines over bottomless tarpits. We'll be hopping across swamps, using crocodile heads like stepping stones. We'll be searching underground through dark passageways crawling with killer scorpions. So pack up your backpack and meet me at the jungle at dawn - and we'll be off to seek a king's ransom in gold, diamonds and lost treasures - in Pitfall Harry's Jungle Adventure.</plot>

        <plot>An unreleased prototype game staring the popular Road Runner cartoon character. Thought to have been based on perhaps a port of the arcade game Locomotion before being re skinned with Roadrunner and Wiley E Coyote.[CR]At the start of each level a birdseed truck will weave its way through the maze dropping off piles of birdseed as it goes. The goal of Roadrunner is to move the tiles around so Wiley Coyote eats as much birdseed as he can before the Roadrunner gets it. Each tile contains a portion of the road which Wiley and the Roadrunner walk on, by sliding the tiles around you can make paths leading to the piles of birdseed or to the tunnels on the side of the board. The tunnels connect one side of the screen to the other, and can be useful for warping across the screen. Unfortunately some of these tunnel entrances are really just painted on, so if Wiley attempts to enter one he'll knock himself out. The only way to tell if a tunnel is real is to watch the Roadrunner and see which tunnels he takes.[CR]Wiley can die if he either runs off the end of the tile or runs into a false tunnel. The Roadrunner appears to be able to back up from dead end track pieces and tunnels so he is impossible to kill, but you can trap him on two dead end pieces and complete the level at your leisure. Once all the birdseed is gone the game moves to the next level. If you happen to run into the Roadrunner you will score 10 points, and you the Roadrunner will be transported back to your starting points. Wiley also scores 35 points for each tile he crosses, and 50 points for each pile of birdseed he collects.[CR]- Excerpt from AtariProtos.com</plot>

        <plot>An unreleased prototype for the Atari 5200. You take control of goofy as he competes in two events, the Marathon Dive and the Pogo Pop.[CR]The Marathon Dive is a game in which you must guide Goofy up a series of platforms so he can reach the diving platform and jump off before the timer runs out. As Goofy climbs up the platforms he must avoid little armored tanks, which will chase Goofy around. Thankfully these tanks can't jump, reverse direction, or use the ladders, so they can be avoided by jumping over them or leading them into a hole (which will cause them to fall down to the next level). Also hindering Goofy's progress are large gaps in the platforms which must be carefully jumped over. If Goofy falls through a hole he'll fall down one level but is otherwise unharmed, however if he is hit by a tank he'll loose a life.[CR] [CR]If Goofy makes it to the top of the platform he will run off the end, making it about halfway across the screen before realizing that he's running in mid-air. Now Goofy will begin to fall, and you must guide him down to the little floating platform below. However the floating platform is constantly moving in an erratic fashion, so hitting it can be tough. If you successfully reach the platform, Goofy will smash into it and have his parachute open a second too late (in typical cartoon fashion). If you miss the platform Goofy will fall into the water and drown (I guess he doesn't know how to swim). As the levels progress the tanks will begin to move faster and faster, the diving platform has more holes in it, and the floating platform moves more erratically. Eventually the difficulty will wrap around however, and the game will get very easy again.[CR]Pogo Pop takes place on a series of squares where Goofy bounces up and down on a pogo stick in an effort to touch every tile. This may sound easy but there's a catch, every time you jump one of the tiles disappears, so the tile that was below you may not be there when you land. As the levels progress the frequency of the tiles disappearing increases, making it harder and harder not to fall through the floor. [CR] [CR]While you're jumping on tiles you can attempt to pop the Mickey Mouse balloons floating above you for extra points. The balloons come in several different colors and are worth a varying amount of points.</plot>

        <plot>You're at the controls of LUKE's X-WING FIGHTER, heading straight for the DEATH STAR. Your mission: to destroy it before the EMPIRE seeks its revenge on the REBEL base. Lock your sights on attacking TIE FIGHTERS and blast them with your proton torpedoes. Race along the DEATH STAR's surface, firing on giant towers. Finally, dive full throttle into the DEATH STAR's equatorial trench. You'll need split-second timing to avoid all the obstacles as you streak through the trench in search of the main reactor. Hit it and you've blown the DEATH STAR out of existence! MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU.</plot>

        <plot>In a very good unreleased adaptation of one of the lesser-known Pac-Man sequels, Super Pac-Man for the Atari 5200 speeds up the action -- and drastically shortens the effectiveness of the power pills and super power pills gobbled up by Pac-Man. If you think you've mastered the original arcade version -- either with the benefit of a lot of quarters or Namco Museum -- this version of Super Pac-Man may yet humble you with its faster pace. Graphically, this is a better translation of its source material than the original Pac-Man for the 5200 was, and the sound is almost a dead-ringer for the arcade game.</plot>

        <plot>Tempest is a shooter using wire-frame graphics. Each Wireway is taken on in turn, and has a network of lines guiding the movement paths of both yourself and the aliens. You remain on the outside and keep shooting as the aliens move towards you. Any that reach the outside are fatal to touch, thus limiting your range of movement greatly if 2 or more achieve this. Some aliens move sideways - in dealing with these, plan ahead allowing for the time your shots to take to travel.[CR]Tempest was not officially released for the Atari 5200 platform. But an initial prototype was finished by Tempest's original programmer Keithen Hayenga and released by AtariAge in 2009.</plot>

Players take part in 6 events.[CR]100 Meter Dash â€“ Running by quickly alternating button presses.[CR]Long jump â€“ Running by alternating button press and correct timing for jump. Hold jump button to set angle (42 degrees is optimal).[CR]Javelin throw â€“ Running by alternating button presses and then using action button correct timing for angle (43 degrees is optimal).[CR]110 Meter Hurdles â€“ Running by alternating button presses and using action button to time hurdles[CR]Hammer throw â€“ Spinning initiated by pressing a run button once and then correctly timed press of action button to choose angle (45 is optimal).[CR]High jump â€“ Running (speed set by computer) and then action button must be held down to determine angle of jump. Once in the air, the run button can be rapidly pressed for additional height.[CR]Gameplay screenshot of the long jump event.[CR]In each event, there is a qualifying time or level that the player must achieve to advance to the next event; failing to qualify (in one heat for running events or three tries in the other events) will reduce the player's number of lives by one, but if none are present in his/her disposal, the game will end.</plot>

        <plot>Never officially released for the Atari 5200 platform. However, a more complete prototype version with track ball support was discovered and released by AtariAge.[CR]Your goal is to destroy all the Xari's that come out of the well in the center of the screen before they can destroy all your blocks. You can use the joystick or the trackball controller.[CR] [CR]Each player resembles a hollow paddle (like a capsule), which you can move around your side of the screen. Your paddle can catch and hold up to three fireballs (the little star looking things that the Xari's shoot), and each stored fireball allows you to destroy one Xari by running into it. If you hit a Xari without any fireballs stored in your paddle, it is temporarily stunned and you cannot catch or deflect any shots for a few seconds. If you already have three fireballs stored up, your paddle will start reflecting the fireballs back at the Xari's (a great tactic for those hard to reach guys that won't come near you) and at your partner (which is not so good). You can choose to reflect shots even if you don't have three fireballs stored up by pressing the bottom controller button.[CR] [CR]If things start to get out of control you can activate your fire extinguisher (using the top controller button) to temporarily protect your blocks. The fire extinguisher coats your blocks with foam and will destroy any shots that touch it. the foam moves quickly down your blocks and only lasts for a few seconds so you have to use it wisely (like when fireballs get behind your blocks). You get one new fire extinguisher each level, which can be stored for later use.</plot>

        <plot>An unreleased prototype based on the popular Namco shooting game.[CR]It's a nightmare, but it's true. Scientific research has determined that we are the actual aliens on Earth and the evil Xevions are the original inhabitants. Now the Xevions want Earth back. minus the humans! Earth's last hope is an experimental fighter plane known as the Solvalou. The mission is dangerous, success isn't guaranteed, and odds are this is a one-way trip. But at this point it's do or die![CR]As Earth's last hope, you must successfully defeat the Xevion assault fleet before they reclaim earth. However this won't be an easy task, the Xevions have had over a millennia to develop the biggest, nastiest, and most destructive ships Earth has ever seen. Thankfully the Solvalou is armed with the latest in weapons technology which will cut through the Xevion hordes like a hot knife through butter. The Solvalou has two main weapons, a laser blaster for taking out air targets, and a photon bomber for destroying ground targets. Over the course of the game you'll run into numerous enemy types which can only be destroyed using the appropriate weapon, so mastering the dual shot (air and ground) technique is vital.</plot>

        <plot>Over 30 seperate zones of indescribable danger. Pitting you against a devastatingly evil minefield of destruction. Not to mention countless horrible enemies. Strike them and they only multiply.Detonate the deadly mines that litter your cosmos or you'll be sorry. Find an elusive, mysterious superportal and you'll get even. It's intense multiscreen action. Which loosely translated, simply means, it's awesome fun.</plot>
