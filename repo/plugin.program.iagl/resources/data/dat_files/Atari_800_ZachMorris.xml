		<emu_comment>The Atari 8-bit family is a series of 8-bit home computers introduced by Atari, Inc. in 1979 and manufactured until 1992. All are based on the MOS Technology 6502 CPU running at 1.79 MHz, roughly twice that of similar designs, and were the first home computers designed with custom co-processor chips. This architecture allowed the Atari designs to offer graphics and sound capabilities that were more advanced than contemporary machines like the Apple II or Commodore PET, and gaming on the platform was a major draw; Star Raiders is widely considered the platform's killer app. Machines with similar performance would not appear until the BBC Micro in late 1981 and the Commodore 64 in 1982.[CR]Developer:  Atari[CR]Manufacturer  Atari[CR]CPU:  MOS Technology 6502B[CR]Memory:  8KB[CR]Graphics:  384x256[CR]Sound:  4x oscillators with noise mixing, or 2x AM digital[CR]Media:  Floppy or Cartrige[CR]Max Controllers:  2 or 4</emu_comment>

		<plot>[B]Andrew Bernstein, 18/09/2006[/B][CR]An excellent remake of Burger Time on the beloved Atari 8-Bit. The programmer made a conscious effort to reproduce typical early 1980s Video Game graphics... and it shows ! A great "retro" game.</plot>

		<plot>[B]Siegfried, 27/08/2012[/B][CR]I fondly remember playing this on a friend's computer. It took ages (and as far as I remember a swap of the cassette) to load and we tried to BREAK and analyse the code. It would really beg for a remake on a SimCity type map. Just reading through the funny instruction booklet is nice![CR][B]The Great Annoyer, 11/05/2010[/B][CR]This is a lovely game - and in basic to boot. Screaming for a remake! I spent many hours playing it with a childhood friend, seeing who could build a monster that could last longer than the other. Took a while to load off the tape drive, if I remember. I think that in itself led to the fond nostalgia (and commitment to) some of these older quirky games.[CR][B]Kirk, 12/06/2007[/B][CR]I LOVED that game! I just wish I could play it again and I have only a windowsxp pc now. Please help if possable.</plot>

		<plot>[B]Lockett, 31/05/2008[/B][CR]I see. Thanks for the information![CR][B]Pierre André, 30/05/2008[/B][CR]Hi Lockett. As you know, the game originated on the Spectrum platform but XXL ported the BBC Micro version onto the Atari 8-Bit. In other words, the source code used (before being ported) is the one from the BBC Micro.[CR][B]Lockett, 30/05/2008[/B][CR]It's funny that this page says that it was converted from the BBC Micro, when it was in fact a Spectrum game.[CR][B]xxl, 30/05/2008[/B][CR]there is new version of KL (v1.2) please update. http://atari.pl/knightlore.obx [CR][B]sikor, 01/02/2008[/B][CR]from atari.online.pl you can download english inctruction, map of game (in both Polish and English language) and music from game in sap format. Directly link: http://atari.online.pl/pliki/knight_lore_mapy_sap.7z[CR][B]Pierre André, 01/02/2008[/B][CR]See... I never had the chance of playing Knight Lore until now (my upgraded Atari 600XL Computer was my only system as a child). Logically, want to wholeheartedly thank XXL (+ Emkay and String) for this conversion as, otherwise, I would have never stumbled upon this gem. :-)</plot>

		<plot>[B]Hayley, 03/07/2011[/B][CR]Great game- remember Jammy Jim always getting the 180's? I believe to finish the game you had to do all "180" shots- and the speaker would cry out "one hundred and Eighty!!"[CR][B]Robert Parker, 01/04/2011[/B][CR]Very high in playability. With a little practice you can win the final. Do not understand why this has an exclamation mark in the title - my copy of the game and the site scans do not show this!![CR][B]Auntie Pastie, 21/03/2008[/B][CR]Was pleased when this came out for the Atari, as my friend had it for the ZX Spectrum and I'd been suitably impressed.[CR]Fun game with well-executed dartboard graphics (although the cut-scenes on this Atari version aren't that great, and lack the dog weeing against the bar!) Music is also nice and jaunty if a bit repetitive.[CR]Also a shame it's so easy, but this was still great fun, and another cracking value game from Mastertronic.</plot>

		<plot>[B]Ben Combee, 24/01/2008[/B][CR]Since this was a port from the Apple II, it used artifacting to generate the colors. In graphics 8 mode, the pixels were too small for NTSC, so depending on how they were placed, you'd see white, red, or blue. Most Apple games used this to get color in high-res mode, and it was common for Apple to Atari ports to use the same mode.[CR][B]Jim Kuchera, 30/12/2006[/B][CR]Some games are more 'art' than 'game'. Such it is with A.E. The first time I saw this game I was stunned by the hires graphics, which I thought were impossible on the Atari. Then the game play, much like the later game Satan's Hollow, really drew me in. What I found really fascinating was that you have to flip your disk to side 2 to play the game. It's a huge loader, and takes a significant amount of time to load each level. But there is nothing like A.E., and one of my friends tells me he believes it's the most unique game every written for the 8-Bit. He might be right!</plot>

		<plot>[B]Jonny EOL, 11/11/2006[/B][CR]A great idea for a game and very funny at times, but ultimately flawed with a difficult parser and bugs. Having parked my car and found the mall entrance, I then couldn't ENTER the mall by any means - some fiddling with the data files on the disk helped me get inside, but yet more bugs finally led me to admit defeat. If a walk through exists, I'd like to see it, just so I can experience the rest of the game.</plot>

		<plot>[B]Auntie Pastie, 29/09/2008[/B][CR]Alex; let me guess... you had the tape version- I had that too! It was a *horribly* slow multiload made all the worse by the Atari's painfully slow tape drives.[CR]I'm guessing that this was originally written and intended as a disk-based game, since it was developed by an American company (AFAIK the U.S. market was mainly disk-based by the mid-late 80s). I'd also guess that the tape version was an afterthought, possibly only commissioned by U.S. Gold for the UK release.[CR]Here's the annoying thing- although quite a lot of UK Atari owners had disk drives (because the Dixons chain sold 800XL/1050 bundles at a very low price in the mid-1980s), the UK 8-bit market as a whole was still fairly tape-driven. The "Budget" computer games market (originals and cut-price reissues of full-price games) in particular was built around cassettes, and they were almost never available on disk. So even us disk-owning Atari users ended up with lots of stuff on tape and suffering slow loading and "Load Error" messages. That's why I had this game on tape. Aaaaaargh! Wish I'd known how good "Transdisk" was much sooner.[CR][B]Alex, 23/11/2006[/B][CR]Ha ha ha, damn i remember this, the first thin was it took an eternity to load, and when the game started i was in some sort of cockpit before being shot down by something ( less than 1 minute into playing)and then it said something bout loading the game over...[CR]Absolute long thing</plot>

		<plot>[B]Greg B., 17/02/2011[/B][CR]"I love the simple graphics, the dark screens and the SILENCE...very mysterious atmosphere."[CR]EXACTLY. Well put, sir.[CR][B]Jim H., 19/03/2010[/B][CR]I absolutely love this game (still play it regularly on my 800.) I love the simple graphics, the dark screens and the SILENCE...very mysterious atmosphere. To Muffy St. Bernard...the secret to playing "Speedy Little Devils" is, first, before entering, aim your gun for a left hand shot, then enter, move straight up a bit then STOP...the speedies will line up with you...two quick side to side shots, then move up a little bit more and stop again, etc until you have the prize, then repeat the procedure in reverse.[CR][B]Muffy St. Bernard, 30/03/2008[/B][CR]All that said, I think that "Speedy Little Devils" on Level 3 is too difficult.[CR][B]Greg B., 21/10/2007[/B][CR]This is among the first few games I ever owned (on cassette) for my Atari 800. The game is loosely based on the Venture coin-op but it's more of a puzzle game than an arcade contest, which is most welcome. And as someone else said, it was definitely worth waiting for the tape to load![CR]I logged many hours on this game back in '82, and to me, it represented what having a computer at home was all about. Instead of a simple shooter (which the arcades well full of), this game made you take the time to think your way through it. At the time, this was a new concept for a video game, especially for one that you could play at home! Pretty mind-blowing stuff, at the time...I wonder how many games of today were influenced by this title.[CR]In sum, this still stands as a classic early piece of Atari 8-bit software.[CR]And yes, the 2 sequels (Ghost Encounters and Journey to the Planets) are even better![CR][B]Muffy St. Bernard, 30/04/2007[/B][CR]A lot of creativity went into this game, which probably explains why I still enjoy it today. The puzzles are clever without being too frustrating, and it has just enough visual flair to hold your attention. Back when I only had a cassette storage device, this game was WORTH waiting for.[CR][B]Norm Thomas, 06/01/2007[/B][CR]An entertaining, novel game. An excellent introduction and the first of a loose trilogy. A little less difficult than Ghost Encounters, the 2nd installment. Action Quest is nicely paced. The graphics are adequate. The sound is good with nice, brief, aural rewards for solving a puzzle. More importantly, the puzzles are logical and solveable. Sometimes, a room does not seem to contain a puzzle. It does. Throughout the trilogy the puzzles are consistent in that some have more than one solution, and that they are not usually sequential or linked. All are timed, and fairly. Some puzzles require a bit of dexterity and all require a bit of thought.[CR]Are you going to shoot those bats, or see what they do when you light a torch?[CR]Experiment, its not fatal. I mean it is, but if you have another quarter?[CR]The wife and I solved Action Quest and it was fun. [CR] </plot>

Even though most of the character interaction was of the "give X to the creature in order to get Y...give Y to the next creature in order to get Z..." you could still make some huge and clever adventure games. All it was missing were room names and the ability to add some text here and there.</plot>

		<plot>[B]Urmo345, 09/11/2013[/B][CR]Haha, even after 25 years it was extremely fun to beat this fuzz bomb again :)[CR]Good game![CR][B]POTA, 13/01/2013[/B][CR]Hello,[CR]if anybody interested - the remake od the "Agent USA" is under production now.[CR]Please visit: http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/738899176/path-of-the-agent?ref=live[CR]and wish us luck:)[CR][B]Mad, 03/03/2008[/B][CR]My most favourite game for atari800. Fantastic feel of freedom, almost 'real time':) and feeling that 'something is spreading' and it could come by train into any city. Spent many sundays with school atlas and this game. Atlas useful in cities with no info booth:)[CR]Nice city panoramas, beautiful day color changes, freedom and TRAINS:)[CR][B]Ashman, 30/01/2008[/B][CR]I could never figure out how to finish the game, Now I know 20 years later lol. Played this for hours upon hours, most of the time as a fuzzbomb[CR][B]Muffy St. Bernard, 14/10/2007[/B][CR]Brush up your geography! Seems like it could be repetitious...you've got to ride A LOT of trains. But fun and attractive, love the sound effects, love the thinly-veiled TV paranoia.[CR][B]Byte, 07/08/2006[/B][CR]This game couldn't be "won", in the sense that once you destroyed the FuzzBomb, it would have a congratulations screen and then it would start all over again.[CR][B]Atari_E477, 29/12/2005[/B][CR]The spooky part of this game was where AgentUSA himself would get "fuzzed" leaving you to watch him travel in a zombie like state hoping to get un-fuzzed. I remember playing this game for hours but don't ever remember winning it. Interesting sound effects.[CR][B]Dave, 26/11/2005[/B][CR]This is one of my favorites, incredible replayability.</plot>

		<plot>[B]Greg B., 21/10/2007[/B][CR]COULD have been an excellent game except for 2 things:[CR]1. It's damn near impossible.[CR]2. You have to use the SPACE BAR to drop bombs! This completely kills the game for me...I'm still not sure how this game got so popular but it's very over-rated, in my opinion.[CR][B]Atari_E477, 29/12/2005[/B][CR]This early (1982) Scramble™ replica was able to mimic the two-tone w/outline appearance of Scramble's terrain map, and utilized the Atari 800's fine scrolling technology. It is actually more playable than the screenshots would lead you to believe.[CR] </plot>

		<plot>[B]GADZombie, 27/04/2014[/B][CR]I made a video from this game. If you wish to watch it, here's the address: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mt1Bn1SYiYA[CR][B]GADZombie, 27/04/2014[/B][CR]Incredibly good old game from 1984 for Atari XL/XE! This is real RTS, many years before Warcraft and Dune 2. You must give commands to your robot army to beat the enemy army. You can help them with your chopper, but they need to fight as well. Many game modes in this one game makes it great for many hours of play. Very underrated game.[CR][B]Gwobby, 26/03/2009[/B][CR]Nice Game... give it a try. Not too involved cross between arcade and simulation game, quite satisfying to play. A game takes about 10-15mins or so. Found a set of instructions on this link: http://www.atariage.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=140769[CR][B]Gwobby, 07/03/2009[/B][CR]Had a couple of goes but don't know how to pick-up troops? Has anyone got the instructions for this game? Thanks.[CR][B]Atari_E477, 29/12/2005[/B][CR]This game is a lot of fun and offers a real-time strategic element beyond what you'd see in a shoot-em-up. Pick up troops with your helicopter and transport them to the battle's hot spots. This is one of the few action games that combines keyboard and joystick effectively.</plot>

		<plot>[B]Christa, 08/12/2012[/B][CR]And that sound whomp whomp whomp celegorm has tipped his toes to the daisies or something Like that. It's been a long time. I always got stuck with the centipede roller ball controller so I'd hit the wall. So frustrating. Lol[CR][B]Gideon Marcus, 05/08/2008[/B][CR]I found this game after I'd played Heracles, and I enjoyed it, but not as much as its younger sibling largely because of the inability to speed up combat[CR]AIIIIIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE![CR][B]Bob aka Dragos, 06/03/2007[/B][CR]This was probably my favorite computer game of all time because it was best enjoyed in a large group. You didn't need to know anything about computers. You just needed to know how to have fun with other people. We always played with 6 or more people and the fact that you could attack other players made it all the more enjoyable. I remember my wifes family coming over one night. They had never even seen a computer before or played a role plaer game. It wasn't long before we were all howling and having fun until the wee hors of the morning. I finally figured out how to beat the game without striking one single blow. It was something to beat the game in this totally passive way. I went back and did it again while videoing it. It was really cool. Good memories[CR][B]Jim Kuchera, 16/12/2006[/B][CR]My sons, and their best friend, grew up together playing this game as a team. I always wanted Haroud el Large. I don't know why it's so much fun because the graphics suck, it takes forevvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvverf to make each move, and did I say, "The graphics suck!" Yet, the guys always wanted to get together for a round of Ali. Sometimes things are great fun together for reasons unknown. This game is one of those 'things'. Warning: Ali Baba is not much fun played alone. It's rare to see this game offered anymore. Too bad.[CR][B]greggman, 08/07/2006[/B][CR]This game supported 17 players at once (not just 4). As well it was one of the first games to reward the player for not killing enemies. Upon finishing the game once a screen appears saying something to the effect of "try playing again but this time without harming a single enemy and you'll receive a personal congradulations from the programmer". Sure enough, there was a way through each room without encountering an enemy.[CR][B]Atari_E477, 29/12/2005[/B][CR]An adventure game with a great sense of mystery and moments of spooky silence. I agree with the other comments that the simple graphics belie the fun-factor, especially entertaining when played cooperatively with at least two players. A must-have for any library of multi player turn-based Atari games.[CR][B]Malcolm, 11/02/2005[/B][CR]The simple graphics at first put me off this game. Everything else about the game is great, especially with at least 2 players. I liked this game so much I completed it when it first came out on my Atari 400, then finished it again on my PC 20 years later. A classic. Also see Return of Heracles by the same programmer - its even better.[CR][B]kris, 28/09/2004[/B][CR]Many many hours were spent on this game. One of the first role-playing games to offer a 4-player option, it was always good fun when someone accidentally attacked another player.</plot>

		<plot>[B]Jimm, 17/08/2011[/B][CR]Great variation on the Galaxians/ Space Invaders theme. Very addictive, I seem to recall as a 12 yr old![CR]The spinny thing on the end of the "eye" would eventually fly off and try to hit you, I recall- it would get extremely frenetic by this point![CR][B]Vaughan, 10/07/2011[/B][CR]This is a seriously good game, with a genius scoring system. The aim isn't to protect your ship, but to protect you energy reserves. Graphics are great - time of writing, my high score is 46,000.[CR][B]Muffy St. Bernard, 14/07/2007[/B][CR]More tips: you can carry five ammo units at a time, but only carry two (so if you die, you don't lose the ones you're carrying). And to shoot the annoying "darts," the best way is to wait until they're very close, shoot, then immediately move away; they have less time to dodge at close range. Finally, you get one ammo point for every 100 points you score. Eventually the eye-line grows a spinning thing on its tail, but I always die before I see what it does.[CR][B]Muffy St. Bernard, 14/07/2007[/B][CR]In case you're wondering: push the joystick up to pick up more ammo; you get more points for shooting two aliens together, or for shooting the "eyes." If you die, the remaining ammo is counted up (not including any you are currently holding), then five ammo points are taken away; if you reach zero, game over. When you destroy aliens you get more ammo points; ideally you'll shoot as many as possible, use up all your ammo, and not die. In later levels, annoying "darts" spawn if you shoot the red line of the "eyes." You can kill them best by firing rapidly when they're close to you, but this is dangerous...just try not to shoot the line.[CR][B]Muffy St. Bernard, 01/05/2007[/B][CR]This game is incredibly fun, and the nifty graphics don't hurt either! Shoot the aliens while trying to protect your ammo storage. Simple, but effective.</plot>

		<plot>[B]Baz, 30/09/2013[/B][CR]An absolute classic. For me, probably the greatest Atari XL game of them all because it was so diverse, had interesting game play and a wonderful sense of humour. The sleeping dogs level had a great amount of tension, the graphics were excellent and so was the sound. Terrific fun, one I always enjoyed playing.[CR]One couldn't had asked for more from a game.[CR][B]Jim H., 19/03/2010[/B][CR]What a wonderful game! Alley Cat really raised the bar on what could be accomplished in the Atari 800 arcade game world. Delightful concept and graphics, hilarious sounds and game play and some of the most unique level designs ever. This game is difficult, but also extremely playable, that perfect combo that keeps you coming back time and time again. Bravo Bill Williams and Synapse!![CR][B]Kevin, 15/03/2010[/B][CR]My all time favorite 800xl game. I still to this day play this game. I still have my working 800xl computer. I just never liked the ending level with the hearts, and the dog milk LEVEL!! argggghhh![CR][B]Greg B., 21/10/2007[/B][CR]I have to agree with everything you guys said...out of the literally thousands of Atari 8-bit games I've played over the years, this one is definitely in the top 10. Totally original concept and it's programmed so well that it was almost unimaginably good at the time. I used to have a lot of friends back then who were Apple II fanatics...then they saw this game. Most definitely a classic.[CR][B]Maggi1971, 01/01/2007[/B][CR]I still rember how much I loved this game. The sounds were amazing and crazy, very nice graphics too. The fantastic thing about this game was the idea behind it. It was (for me) the first with "games in a game". I played it with a friend of mine and we tried to discover all of the "mini-games". Hard to master, but not unfair. A true classic.[CR] [CR][B]Jonny EOL, 11/11/2006[/B][CR]This was probably the first game that convincingly emulated the look and feel of a cartoon on a home computer. Whether you're chasing birds and mice, going diving for a snack in the goldfish bowl, fighting with the dog, clawing at the laundry or trying to impress a lady cat, this game really captures the spirit of cartoon cats such as Tom, Sylvester or Top Cat. Colourful graphics, amusing sound effects and a really entertaining play. A masterpiece! [CR][B]Atari_E477, 29/12/2005[/B][CR]The screenshots cannot do justice to the incredible animation of Alley Cat. The cat is 'alive' with movement right down to the twitching tail. It's an impressive feat considering the pixel resolution used. The humor is wonderful. This is probably the cutest game ever made for the Atari 800, and a great departure for anyone fatigued by monsters exploding in space. Alley Cat is a very fun game, and is actually several different games in-one. But what really makes this game a must-have is the audio effects. From the metallic clunk of the trash can lids to the humanoid "hi-yah" when a shoe is thrown at you - to the mewls of the kitty, Alley Cat is a tour de force of Atari audio chip programming with such tighly controlled high-pass filter sweeps as to give the impression of audio samples. Maybe they are audio samples! Alley Cat is worth having just for the bubbles-under-water sound when the cat goes diving. I've never heard the Atari makes sounds like this before or since Alley Cat.[CR][B]steve, 25/02/2005[/B][CR]This is one of the few games I have ever played that has actually made me crack up laughing - such is the humour to be found in this game, with the cartoon type violence and animation. It was ahead of the pack all those years ago for its use of graphics personality and arcade type puzzles and still stands up today for those virtues. Mieoww!</plot>

		<plot>[B]maggi71, 14/01/2013[/B][CR]Best music and intro I've ever seen on the Atari 8-bit when it comes to games.[CR]I don't know what Gilbertson did with the soundchip but the music is absolutely fantastic and outstanding.[CR]Great gameplay too. It's a shame that the series could never been completed. I think Datasoft were bought up by Software Toolworks in 1988 and stopped pulling out any games or software.[CR][B]Jon, 31/08/2011[/B][CR]@MalcolmM[CR]Saying you played this game for two hours and hated it, is like saying you played chess for two hours and hated it.[CR]Idiotic.[CR][B]Andreas Koch, 14/08/2011[/B][CR]Well,[CR]the sequel has the name "Alternate Reality - The Dungeon" and exists on the 8bit Atari. The sequel was published by Datasoft in the US and by US-Gold in Europe...[CR][B]Stellar Jetman, 03/08/2011[/B][CR]@MalcolmM[CR]&gt;I heard that the sequel, which I believe never came out on the Atari 8-bit, was a bit better.[CR]Never played either of the games, so I can't speak for their quality, but the sequel actually was released on this platform.[CR][B]MalcolmM, 03/08/2011[/B][CR]Never understood why people liked this game. I bought it, played it for a few hours and hated it. Nothing much to do. I heard that the sequel, which I believe never came out on the Atari 8 bit, was a bit better.[CR]I can easily imagine the programmer claiming that this game inspired the movie the Matrix. He was always making absurd claims about how great his games were. [CR]I would nominate this game for most overated 8 bit Atari title.[CR][B]Greg B., 16/02/2011[/B][CR]Hey Murray B., get over yourself. I do feel bad for you though, as you were the only person ever in the history of computers to receive a faulty game disk. Why don't you contact Datasoft and see how your refund is working out...[CR][B]Murray B, 07/11/2009[/B][CR]Mine busted. The software came on floppy and the main disk was copy protected. The floppies were cheap and mine failed after about two hours of use. [CR]The disk was returned to the manufacturer for replacement but I am still waiting for replacement after 25 years. It is starting to look like my $80 is down the drain.[CR]Mine were not the only disks to fail and I expect this was a major factor in the demise of the series. Somehow these facts have been forgotten.[CR]Soon after that Pool of Radiance came out for the C-64 and I was one sad Atari boy with no AR and nothing that could play PoR. Life was hard without an RPG but like they say what doesn't kill you will probably scar you for life. [CR][B]Ray Wilmott, 05/11/2009[/B][CR]Best Atari 8-bit game. Even after 25 years, I still play it now and then (with the same character I started with in 1985!)[CR][B]Andre, 20/10/2009[/B][CR]Best Atari game ever![CR][B]Greg B., 21/10/2007[/B][CR]Heh - this game was so far ahead of the competition when it came out that it was almost laughable. People are still playing it and talking about; there are pages all over the net about the game. YEARS ahead of it's time...and it still holds up today. The Atari 800 version is actually the best version out there, avoid the others, even the ST version.[CR][B]Greg, 12/09/2007[/B][CR]One of my favourite games for the Atari. I was so disappointed that the series did not continue past "The Dungeon" but I did manage to get as far as possible in the two existing titles (the Dragon was the toughest encounter in the Dungeon IIRC), and found the alien chamber in the Dungeon.[CR][B]Kris, 29/04/2007[/B][CR]The simplicity and overall blandness of The City is what made it so enticing. From the despair of trudging around in an unfamiliar place in pouring rain hoping you don't get mugged, to the feeling of warmth when you happen to stumble upon an after-hours pub playing some tunes, this game really struck a sense of feeling real. I never did find the entrance to the Dungeon until the map became available on-line several years later![CR][B]Thoréandan, 03/11/2006[/B][CR]This game may well have been the inspiration for the blockbuster movie The Matrix, starring Keanu Reeves as Neo. The programmer, Phil Price, once admitted to having outlined the plot of AR to "two guys while at a restaurant in Westwood", who may well have been the Wachowski brothers. This happened some 15 years before The Matrix was released. There are a lot of similarities between the plots of AR and The Matrix. [CR]For instance, for Alternate Reality Destiny (the final chapter in the tale), Mr Price had storyboarded this little gem: "Searching further this immense ship you discover a chamber filled with metal cocoons. Using wit and knowledge gained through other locations you decipher the controls and the display. You learn that these cocoons hold bodies, the bodies of all of those captured. The machines keep the bodies physically alive and fit, but imprisoned. The minds of those entrapped are tapped and fed with images. The ships computer can even permit the images to interact with solid/material components of the ship. You are an image. What is reality?" And that was back in 1984, 16 years before the Matrix![CR]BTW, your pg.4 of the manual is missing.</plot>

		<plot>[B]Daniel Thomas MacInnes, 09/05/2011[/B][CR]It's amazing how Electronic Arts just exploded out of the gate in 1983. Archon I and II, Murder on the Zinderneuf, MULE, Seven Cities of Gold, One on One, Pinball Construction Set...How I wish EA today could capture just a fraction of that magic.[CR][B]MalcolmM, 10/02/2011[/B][CR]For fans of Archon, you should try the remake Archon Classic on the PC. It has a classic mode that is faithful to the original. It also adds multiple AI levels, and four campaigns, plus lots of other extras.[CR][B]1man, 30/01/2011[/B][CR]for those of you who are using Facebook: i created a fan page for the ol' Classic ARCHON: [CR]http://www.facebook.com/#!/pages/Classic-ARCHON/115144945167519[CR]hope to find you there, before the masters intervene, lol.[CR][B]stefan berner, 31/05/2010[/B][CR]Great Game !! Archon and MULE are my most played games on this time. Both are fantastic multiplayer titles we played this games so many night´s[CR][B]Scott Wozniak, 15/09/2008[/B][CR]MASTERPIECE. MIND-BLOWING. INFINITELY REPLAYABLE. I wonder how many hours of my life were spent on this one? Paul Reiche III made a game called "The Unholy War" in 1998 for the Playstation that is a spiritual successor to Archon. My highest recommendation. 10/10.[CR][B]Wesley Connally, 19/01/2008[/B][CR]Archon was actually available on diskette. I still own it. It still works. You do have to use Translator though.[CR][B]Greg B., 21/10/2007[/B][CR]Yep, another all-time classic. Loosely inspired by the 3d-chess game in Star Wars, Archon is a masterful combination of chess-like strategy and arcade action. And yes, once you learn how to beat the computer, only another player will do. And, like Chess, you only get better at the game when you get clobbered at it (at least in my case). Sigh...it's really apparent that this game is from another time, back when software companies weren't afraid to try something NEW. Those were the days...[CR][B]Pengwin, 23/07/2007[/B][CR]This was the first disk game I purchased, and remains to this day, one of my favourites.[CR]The idea of chess with arcade combat was genius. The computer opponent was a little easy to beat, once you'd worked out each characters strengths and weaknesses, but against a human, this game was utterly fantastic.[CR][B]Jim Kuchera, 30/12/2006[/B][CR]There is no question that this is one of the 'top ten' for the 8-bitter. It's not often that strategy plus quick eye/hand coordination are fused together with such beauty. The computer is actually easier to beat than a quick-handed flesh and blood opponent. I always hated chess, but this game showed me that chess can live effectively in a new form. [CR]A little aside: the game is available not only on disk but cartridge as well. It was 'blue boxed' and still available at a reasonable price on eBay. I still play this one on my old 800 tank, and love it.[CR][B]Jeff, 12/12/2006[/B][CR]This has to be one of the greatest games of all time, on any platform. 2 player mode is fantastic and there is no game more pure than this. 10/10[CR][B]Deathdealer, 05/10/2006[/B][CR]Great mix of strategy and action. Hard to beat a game like this.[CR][B]Thomas Smailus, 17/01/2006[/B][CR]This was one of THE classic Atari games that I played over and over again. Many afternoons, after school in the computer lab. Its sequel even pulled in my English teacher for some gameplay.</plot>

		<plot>[B]Chris Carman, 01/08/2009[/B][CR]Tough game! Not as much fun as Archon, but definitely more challenging and with a greater variety of characters. The best way to beat the computer is to build up a super-wraith by sucking up all the life of gradually larger enemies, and then finally take out all the Adepts until it causes the Apocalypse, where your castles fight (which I always thought was pretty cool). Fun game![CR][B]Brew, 12/01/2009[/B][CR]Archon II, Adept. One of the most amazing feats of the 8 bit era. Imagine chess, mixed with monopoly, with the intense arcade action of pacman, then spice it up with fantasy and magic and you have this amazing piece of software. Arizona for Archon II !!![CR][B]kris, 10/11/2007[/B][CR]I think I beat the computer once by accident somehow but could never repeat it. It really wasn't fair because he could always see your invisible wraiths - what crap! I prefer Archon I to this one.[CR][B]Andreas Koch, 23/07/2007[/B][CR]Well, I love Archon and have played it hundreds of times. But Archon 2 is heavy - has anyone finished (won against) the computer ?!? Me: Never !! So until now, the computer in Archon 2 seems unbeatable to me...</plot>

		<plot>[B]eppy2000, 19/03/2014[/B][CR]For some reason, certain, simple arcade games didn't necessarily make the smooth transition to the Atari 8-bit (c.f., Space Invaders). Without recreating the vector graphics of its arcade counterpart, this conversion of Asteroids has a bit of a different feel. And it's also very dull looking. (At least the 2600 version made up for that with a variety of colors.) The movement of the ship and graphics are also quite choppy. Still, one needs to give Atari the benefit of the doubt because in 1981 the potential of the 8-bit was not yet fully realized at this time. At least by Atari, anyway.[CR][B]Daniel Thomas MacInnes, 09/05/2011[/B][CR]How can the Atari 800 version of Asteroids have WORSE graphics than on the 2600? Seriously, Asteroids is much better on the VCS. If you really want your fix, take a look at the 5200 and 7800 versions, which have really cool multiplayer.[CR][B]vacuumnoise, 30/04/2011[/B][CR]yes very dull, and not even a good dull. Not very playable either...[CR][B]Muffy St. Bernard, 21/09/2007[/B][CR]I've never been an Asteroids fan, but the lock-step rotation in this version REALLY spoils it for me. Dull, dull, dull.[CR][B]Michael Strorm, 31/05/2007[/B][CR]This no-frills conversion of the famous arcade game loses the atmosphere which made the original special. Although the graphics here are in solid colour (not monochromatic wireframe), they're low-res, flat and lacking in personality. Ditto most other aspects of the game, down to the use of the standard typeface- it just doesn't look like a lot of effort was put into this. The extra gameplay options are fine, and this conversion isn't awful by any means; it just doesn't feel like Asteroids.</plot>

		<plot>[B]Pengwin, 21/02/2009[/B][CR]A fantastic version of Space invaders that I find myself coming back to again and again. In my opinion, one of the best conversions made.[CR][B]Atari_E477, 29/12/2005[/B][CR]Atari Invaders is a wonderfully simple, smooth, and colorful adaptation of the classic game Space Invaders. Better than many others.</plot>

		<plot>[B]Atari_E477, 29/12/2005[/B][CR]Like most Imagic games, Atlantis tends toward the repetitive yet challenging game play, with a nice color scheme. The concept of Atlantis is somewhere between Air-Sea Battle (Atari 2600) and Missile Command.</plot>

		<plot>[B]Lockett, 03/05/2009[/B][CR]This game is incredible! It really shows off the Atari's palette and scrolling, and the warping effect on the camels and player ship is one of the neatest things ever. The only problem is that the gameplay is a bit repetetive and the camels are blocky, but it's a great way to kill five minutes.[CR]It's also a million times better than the C64 version, which is slow, ugly, and dull.[CR][B]Auntie Pastie, 21/03/2008[/B][CR]Although it's bordering on sacrilege to say so, I always thought this game was overrated. Sure, the offbeat humour is fun, and the graphics (although chunky) are nice, with large well-animated camels, pretty backgrounds and parallax scrolling. But the gameplay itself is a bit too monotonous- shooting some camel's backside repeatedly until it dies, while avoiding those irritating missiles. Repeat several times to clear the level... then there's more of the same, just slightly faster.[CR]It's not even *that* original under the surface- AOTMC owes a lot to the earlier "Empire Strikes Back" game on the Atari VCS.[CR]It's still a decent game if you're into that sort of thing, but I don't think it lives up to the hype.[CR][B]Paul Westphal, 02/07/2007[/B][CR]Like all of minter's games, graphics and sound are all above par.Truly trippy, and shows off his affliction for llama's (camels,yaks).He also did the VLM for the jag, as well as NUON.[CR][B]RetroKel, 21/08/2005[/B][CR]A very fast paced game in its day! I played on this game for many hours. Like all Jeff Minter games - it's a classic! A truly excellent game!</plot>

		<plot>[B]FastRobPlus, 22/02/2013[/B][CR]A poor but not terrible game. The villain was Cosmi. In their quest for maximizing sales, they used the name and art of a fantastic C64 game on a completely different game that was not really that good. If you’d played the C64 version prior, you’d have been crushed to have paid good money for this game.[CR][B]hororus, 16/08/2009[/B][CR]Yes, there was. I'm actually bidding on on ebay;)[CR][B]Auntie Pastie, 07/06/2007[/B][CR]There are two different versions of Aztec Challenge; the original (copyright-dated 1982) and an improved rewrite (dated 1983). According to the author the original version (green man, wavy background) was originally known as "The Bonifas" and released through APX. Cosmi tweaked it and renamed it "Aztec Challenge". The rewritten version (gradient background) is still far from the best Atari game ever, but it's not that bad, and kind of fun. The Top Ten and (AFAIK) Ariola releases both feature the rewritten version. Cosmi also released a C64 "Aztec Challenge", but that appears to be a very different game that just happens to have the same name.</plot>

		<plot>[B]Gwobby, 02/10/2012[/B][CR]BMX Simulator is one of the better overhead games on the A8. Hit fire as soon as GO is shown to get a fast start, thought being ahead of the computer biker adds to the pressure. You don't need to beat him just finish each race in time. With a bit of practice you can get to race #7. [CR]Neat touches where the computer opponent makes mistakes (has a pre-programmed path). Proably missed by people is that you can play as biker #2 instead and the computer controls biker #1 - which has a different path and makes mistakes on different levels. Game also has 2 player head to head. [CR]9/10[CR]www.gwobby.webs.com[CR][B]steve, 23/08/2007[/B][CR]Good original game idea - racing your bmx bike around a track against a player, from a birds eye view. Graphics + sound are great, showing what the atari can do. However the addictive/attention curve in this game is far too abrupt.Levels 1-3 are quite easy, then things get a little tough. I never could complete it! Good game though.</plot>

The graphics are block graphics, and the little red dashes indicating roadway are really primitive. But this is the kind of game little tykes love to play with one another. And play they will! This is a hard one to drop. I like it certainly as much as Pole Position. It's the same premise.</plot>

		<plot>[B]Jim Kuchera, 11/03/2007[/B][CR]Bandits is an outstanding shooter where the alien 'little buggers' are great at dodging your best attempts to zap 'em. I love Bandits---the sound, the wonderfully smooth graphics, the premise of stealing your fruit, etc. My only beef is that every single level, like Jumpman (another of my favorites) is a pain. This great little game will surely become one of your favorites, and it was released by one of the best software houses of all time---Broderbund. At the time of release, the other great houses were OnLine, Sirius, Synapse, Infocom, Dataquest. Electronics Arts was not yet with us, but was to become The Great One along with Sierra.[CR][B]Spiff, 17/10/2005[/B][CR]This game was inspired by a mediocre arcade game of the era called "Stratovox"- but they improved it a hundredfold to make it one of the best games on the Atari. You must protect various supplies from being stolen by aliens. The sounds, colors, and graphics are spectacular.</plot>

		<plot>[B]Andreas Koch, 22/07/2007[/B][CR]Well, allthough the graphics are good, the gameplay is totally boring for me. First of all the game is extremely slow, the computer enemies are very dumb and most of the time easy to beat. Search for the computer opponent at first, shoot+destroy it, then wait until it re-materializes a few centimeters left or right of the position you just destroyed it. Shoot again... repeat this process and you easily win some levels... I was too bored to play it to the last level...</plot>

		<plot>[B]The Targ of Utarg, 25/10/2007[/B][CR]One of the best Atari cartridge games in my opinion. Shoot the alien saucers to progress to the next level, whilst avoiding (or shooting) other obstacles and craft - it’s as simple and compelling as that. Also included is alternate multiplayer and level select option which adds variety. Unfortunately the difficulty is not adjustable but the first few levels are easy enough before things become frantic. A testament to it is the fact I still occasionally play it now – twenty four years after its first release! [CR]A classic.</plot>

		<plot>[B]Jomar Machado, 07/11/2008[/B][CR]I've dreamed weeks about this game...but I was never able to finish it...;)[CR]Great Game!!! [CR][B]Jonny EOL, 12/02/2008[/B][CR]This diagonal-scrolling fighter plane shooter remains one of the finest games the 8-bit Atari ever saw. The whole thing is just so well designed, from the 'Rule Britannia' opening theme to the smooth scrolling graphics and addictive gameplay. A mixture of enemy planes and ground targets, and a raid on the enemy city for those who make it that far. I actually completed this game on the highest level once - perhaps my greatest moment of gaming?[CR][B]eppy2000, 07/10/2007[/B][CR]This game is also on my top ten list of greatest Atari 8-bit games. Synapse really cared about Atari computers. Polin took a Zaxxon concept, and made something quite original out of it. Top notch graphics and sound, smooth gameplay, and entertainment value makes this a winner all around. My favorite parts of the game is going into the inner cities and the final bombing runs. It took practice to get it done quickly and accurately! Like Star Raiders, I always wanted to play again to see if I could get a higher ranking. To date, my best is Blue Max, Class 3.[CR][B]steve, 25/07/2007[/B][CR]This has to be one of the top ten greatest games on any platform in modern history! The graphics are functional and attractive, the sound is realistic and spot on, and the gameplay well. The gameplay is beautifully curved from mastering the altitude, shooting in coming planes and landing, through to reaching the city level. [CR]Gameplay is what it is all about and Blue Max is as perfect as they come.[CR][B]ZombiE, 09/05/2007[/B][CR]One of the best games on Atari! Great playability and fast shooter.[CR]If anyone want to try my own 3D version of Blue Max, then look at: http://gad.art.pl/opis.php?i=352&amp;kat;=0&amp;od;=0&amp;srt;=1[CR]The site is in Polish, but "Wersja instalacyjna" link is a download and game is in English. This is a beta release.[CR][B]Jim Kuchera, 19/12/2006[/B][CR]As with nearly every Synapse title, this one has extreme playability to the max. What a wonderful side-angle scroller. Far more fun to play than the Zaxxon translation, this little block graphics game really draws you in. However, it does take some practice with the stick, and gauging your altitude. I remember the first time I tried to take off, I pulled back on the stick and immediately crashed. Yikes, the stick is in REVERSE. Push forward to take off. Well, small complaint aside, the one is great fun, and well worth looking for on The Net. It's out there somewhere.[CR][B]Jeff Sidlosky, 26/06/2005[/B][CR]I remember playing this game alot as a child (5 - 8 years old), it was one of the primary games I remember playing![CR]I always found it difficult to land after I completed a level, which was frusterating to say the least. [CR]It wasn't exactly my favorite game, that was probably BoulderDash. [CR][B]MIH, 06/03/2005[/B][CR]One of my private "BIG TEN" of ATARI games...:) </plot>

The author of this game must have awakened from a nightmare, ran to his hex machine and created this wacked out game. I love it!

		<plot>[B]Baz, 30/09/2013[/B][CR]A textbook example on how to create a good solid platform game. Was pretty tricky but had enough humour, challenge and gimmicks to keep one returning to it. Very entertaining. I never did complete it, but had much fun trying to![CR][B]Atari Frog, 19/06/2012[/B][CR]How about paying attention first? The Aackosoft release is definitely a "9" and you'll find the cartridge version under Big Five Software where it belongs...[CR][B]bountyBobme, 15/06/2012[/B][CR]Why is this at a 9? There are at least 2 to 4 cassettes on eBay at any one time. Cheap to. Why is Bounty Bob listed as cassette only?

BBSB is much more challenging and has more screens. Plus BBSB has the unique controlled jumping! Both exceptional games though :-)[CR][B]Retro Kel, 19/04/2009[/B][CR]This is quite possibly the second best platformer ever made for the Atari - the first best game of course being Miner 2049'er. Both games were absolutely great to play and I still enjoy playing them on the emulator now. Nowadays of course I know all the levels off by heart (Sad or what?) so I don't have to try and work out how to get to the next level.[CR]Still great games to play even now - anyone who has never played these games - GET THEM NOW!!![CR][B]Richard, 02/08/2008[/B][CR]Robert, I also bought this tape version in the Netherlands. And I also "played it to death". I always admired Bill Hogue from cramming this much fun into the old 64k 800XL! A few years later I got this game on (boot-) disk. That was quite a relief! No more "13 minutes left to load" (see screendump above).[CR][B]Robert, 08/07/2008[/B][CR]This is in my opinion the best platform game on the Atari 8-bit. I played it to death. The Dutch Aackosoft tape release was in an incredibly big box that could easily contain 8 normal tape covers. But it only contained a bare tape and a poster with instructions.[CR][B]Jonny EOL, 11/11/2006[/B][CR]A mostly outstanding platformer, with all sorts of features and surprising (it's got the best high-score table ever, bar none). Could have done with a few more 'skip previously completed levels' options - getting beyond Level 5 in sitting was an exercise in patience.[CR][B]Darry Conlan, 01/02/2006[/B][CR]There is a standalone .exe playable on Windows at http://www.bigfivesoftware.com/Emulator/emulator.htm[CR]You can play Bounty Bob and Miner on your PC!![CR][B]Thomas Smailus, 17/01/2006[/B][CR]As a fan of Miner 2049'er, I've been wanting this game since I heard of it, but as it won't run on an actual Atari for the US (PAL/NTSC differences in ROM) - so I'd LOVE to finally be able to play on an emulator.. but alas, there is no image! ARGH! I do have the floppy (PAL) - can it run on a standard emulator if you feed it the PAL ROM?</plot>

		<plot>[B]limesparks, 14/06/2011[/B][CR]Goonies had that same cooperation style with all of the Goonies characters, just as Bruce Lee has with the Green Yamo in this one...[CR][B]limesparks, 14/06/2011[/B][CR]definitely one of my faves too. Zorro, as well as Goonies, use the same engine and are as enjoyable...[CR][B]Gwobby, 12/06/2011[/B][CR]Did you try playing Zorro too ;-)[CR][B]Andreas Koch, 12/06/2011[/B][CR]Well, this is one of my favourite A8 games of all time ![CR]Its a bit sad that it has "only" 20 screens and there has never been an official second part or an addendum with more screens - especially since there are some places in the game which look like openings but which alas do never open. Maybe the game had originally been planned somewhat bigger (with more screens) but one removed them to make the game work with 32k RAM...?!? [CR]Programmers out there - how about a sequel or new screens for this game ?!? And if you do so, also make a sequel for Fort Apocalypse or better some new levels for it...[CR][B]Kevin, 17/03/2011[/B][CR]Probably my favorite Atari 8bit game. I have beaten this game probably 50+ times ATLEAST. great sound, and i am a huge bruce lee fan anyways. Actually i just beat it 3 days ago on my arcade cabinet that i built.[CR][B]steve, 04/07/2009[/B][CR]Probably the best platform on the atari. Great graphics and sound. However where this game comes into it's own is in the playabilty department....it's so addictive! Add to this the two player feature...you have a classic atari game![CR][B]James, 25/06/2009[/B][CR]This is one of my 80's favourites which wasn't an arcade converstion. I first saw it at a friends place when he got a bootleg of it for the C64. I later bought this for my Atari 8bit system and still have that original copy too! This is a game I finished early on much easier due to one screen where bonus lives could be had. I remember on one screen on the bottom in one corner you could grab a blue/red ying-yang symbol for a bonus life, you could leave the room, re-enter and it would reappear and you could get several bonus lives this way.[CR][B]Scott Wozniak, 15/09/2008[/B][CR]True story... When I was in the 7th grade, I took 2 of my classmates home during lunch break to show them this game. We never made it back to school that day and played the 2-player mode all afternoon. Man, that was great. 10/10.[CR][B]Maggi1971, 19/12/2006[/B][CR]One oft the best 8-Bit (Atari) Games ever, like most games from Datasoft.[CR]No cheats needed to see the endscreen. The playability of this game was awesome (something you can't say about several games from this decade...) [CR]The version for the Atari was as good as the one for the C64.[CR]We called the green guy "Sumo". Also one of the first games with a "real" two player-mode.[CR]The Endboss was a laugh..[CR]Even after over 20 years I still play this game 2 or 3 times a year.[CR]Still pretty addictive and a true classic!!![CR][B]Jeff, 12/12/2006[/B][CR]I'm a C64 guy and this game is awesome on either system. Somehow I find the Atari version a little harder. I like the previous comment about playing with neighbors and siblings, so true. Behold the genius...[CR][B]Alex, 23/11/2006[/B][CR]Ha ha ha im catching bare jokes on this site , anyway yeah this game was dope.[CR][B]Panemon, 26/04/2006[/B][CR]Wow, I remember playing this game as a kid, on my father's Atari 65k XE. This had to of been the best game ever made for any atari game I've ever played. Me and my sister grew up playing this game, we had the 5¼ floppy disk version of it. Me and my sister used to call the computer controlled warrior: "The Bidget." It's quite possibly the best Atari game ever made. If anyone knows of a ROM file of this, please email me immediately![CR][B]Matthew Wells, 08/09/2005[/B][CR]We had to load the game via tape deck which seems like it took an hour, although it was more likely 15-20 minutes. The Yamo-Bruce Lee fights were memorable, especially against neighbors and older brothers. You could set up the Yamo to sit underneath Bruce, who could fall repeatedly and then grab the chain rope and fall again, earning mega points and then free lives (re:Super Mario Brothers tortise shell trick), helpful for finishing the game. The problem was Bruce could not get out of the fall sequence, which would mean a tape re-boot![CR]Ah, Datasoft or current right holders I would hope could post a tidy profit redoing this kind of game with simplicity and today's modern gameplay.[CR][B]MIH, 06/03/2005[/B][CR]So...what can I add...ABSOLUTELLY BRILLANT !!![CR]I would talking about this kind of games for hours...if You want to talk as well just give me a touch by Email...[CR][B]Eric, 20/01/2005[/B][CR]The greatest Adventure/action Game of all! No game can beat this particular game not in a million years! this the most ultimate game i'd play every day and night without stopping to eat or drink no can put this unstoppable game down on the floor when theyv'e finished this , people will keep on playing this game forever un til they die! Number 1 for this game, the king of games this is!!!!!!For mee!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!![CR][B]nomad, 10/01/2005[/B][CR]Wow, my two favorites (When I'm forced to pick) are Bruce Lee and Star Raiders as well![CR]Yes, I completed this several times back in the day, and every once and a while my brother and I will get together and pull these games out.[CR]I complete this game each time... it's like riding a bike I suppose.[CR]It actually just repeats over and over once you complete it though.[CR]Excellent game in my opinion... Back when games were about fun first.[CR]The somewhat abstract level designs will always remain in my imagination.[CR]Climbing and jumping through boards that made sense some how... though I couldn't tell you what the obstacles truly are... just some partially surreal video game world created to give Bruce Lee his ultimate challenge.[CR]One of the best![CR][B]kris, 28/09/2004[/B][CR]A great action/adventure combo that seems to go on forever. The last few levels are quite a challenge. Of course, the two-player option allowing Green Yamo to annoy the heck out of Bruce Lee was what made this one memorable for me.[CR][B]martin, 20/06/2004[/B][CR]this one is a big game like the disk version of Zorro. good but tight controls ensure this platformer is a worthy game[CR][B]Ed Burns, 06/03/2004[/B][CR]This is one of my two favorite games of all time, the other being Star Raiders. Has anyone ever completed it?</plot>

		<plot>[B]vacuumnoise, 30/04/2011[/B][CR]cool seizure inducing graphics but terrible gameplay, this game gets boring very quickly too.[CR][B]Jim Kuchera, 31/01/2007[/B][CR]Sorry, but this is a terrible port from the arcade. There is nothing to recommend this game---absolutely nothing. Sadly, I was one of the unfortunate ones who bought this product. We had a users group where each month there was a drawing for "Dog of the Month". The 'winner' got the 'dog' that month. It seemed that this one was always recirculated because no one enjoyed it. What a shame because the premise of this shooter was good, and the arcade version was first rate. Keep truckin'.</plot>

Especially since, in this game, your cowboy waves his arms like a terrified schoolgirl with wet nail polish.[CR]But it just goes on and on. Dodge dodge dodge. Then you die. Like life.[CR][B]Raketbosse, 19/11/2009[/B][CR]A very simple game but incredibly addictive and fun.</plot>

		<plot>[B]Ernie Moore Jr., 24/02/2012[/B][CR]Interesting you should mention boring, because that's where I get the fun. I play games so they are interesting to watch. Games are tools for learning-and investigating limits--resource management and Thought to physical execution. For those still reading, strategizing and timing your plan implimentation...the oh sh..ucks it's not working-out, is interesting and exciting to me and at least one other. I suppose as with at least a few other things, how you deliver might matter. If you can bomb decoy holes deep and multiple tunnels to surface on the other side of the screen and it's Yawn, O.K. But I like this game at my current understanding of play.-Ernie Moore Jr.[CR][B]Tomasz Tatar, 24/09/2007[/B][CR]This game is probably the one on which I've spent the most time on my Atari 65 XE and later on emulators. It is extremely addictive. It does not become impossible (at least up to about 12th level), but needs some strategy. For example, sometimes it is better to let bucks drop from a board to complete level then to retrieve it when it is too difficult. Regards to all Buried Buck$ maniacs![CR][B]Thomas Smailus, 17/01/2006[/B][CR]Buried Bucks is one of the great classic games I played many years on my Atari 800 and still do these days, when I drag out the Atari. The game premise is simple - but the complaint that the game stinks is misplaced. The beauty in many of the simplest of games is the simplicity - that lets you focus on the game play without being overwhelmed by lots of superfluous junk. There is a lot of strategy, agility and timing in those $ and falling dirt.[CR][B]martin, 20/06/2004[/B][CR]this is so pretty and chillout like a Bill Williams game. rescue the dollars and dont get dumped on. there is a follow-up called Chopper Hunt with a few enhancements</plot>

		<plot>[B]Velcro_SP, 07/06/2009[/B][CR]Just played this, scored 38,100. I see where the previous poster said he or she completed the game, but I was thinking it just kept repeating the three levels. I completed the three levels twice and ran out of lives after that. Canyon Climber is a good platform game. It has similarities to Donkey Kong, but it is its own thing too. I like the theme and colors of being out West, blowing up bridges while eluding rams, dodging arrows shot by Indians and rocks dropped by birds. You need good motor skills and timing to jump correctly. The game keeps you on edge. The box had cool cover art.[CR][B]Dominic Trill, 22/01/2005[/B][CR]I remember my uncle buying this in October 1982 along with Bug Attack(Cavalier Computers) and Dodge Racer(Synapse) when he bought his Atari 800,many an hour spent on this one!Great platformer,still managed to complete it(after some practice) when i booted it up recently!</plot>

		<plot>[B]Atari Frog, 08/08/2011[/B][CR]Though probably a low "9", this rating is for a boxed version. Loose cartridges of this game are also uncommon but the rarity would probably be between "7" and "8".[CR][B]Stellar Jetman, 08/08/2011[/B][CR]@Robert[CR]&gt;So how rare is this?[CR]Pretty rare, if that 9 to the right is any indication.[CR][B]Robert, 19/04/2011[/B][CR]So how rare is this? I have Captain Beeble and just played it the other night. It was the favorite of my neighborhood back in the 80s when I got it. I must say the old games look superb on the new TVs. Anyone got any info on how rare?[CR][B]Spaceman Spiff, 29/03/2011[/B][CR]How many levels did this game have? I never got past the one with the moving "CPU" base. I believe it was the 5th or 6th level. Ah, memories :)[CR][B]Gray, 29/10/2008[/B][CR]One of my all-time favorites. Had a (pirated) copy when I was a kid and I still play it twenty years later! Beating all of the levels reveals a new challenge - playing through the levels again, only this time, you die upon contact with the walls! [CR][B]kris, 10/11/2007[/B][CR]Very challenging and addictive. I recall one of the later levels had numerous large boulders moving up and down at high speeds that had to be navigated through - brutal.</plot>

The sequel is great too.[CR][B]Dominic Trill, 29/10/2005[/B][CR]Just re-aquired this game,unfortunately time has taken its toll as i don't remember it being this bad!!!Still,it was 1982/3,and is still a peice of Atari history...P.S. the sequel isn't much of an improvement,sorry!</plot>

Very challenging and very tough vertical space shooter, this is definitely for the die-hard fans. I do wish Infogrames, aka Atari Interactive, would bring this game back...that is, faithfully and without completely screwing it up. I'm probably asking for too much.[CR][B]Greg B., 30/10/2007[/B][CR]A great game but probably one of the most frustrating games I've EVER played.

		<plot>[B]Auntie Pastie, 09/04/2011[/B][CR]Atari seem to have released two distinct versions of Centipede for the 400/800/XL/XE computers. [CR]In addition to the original 1982 release, there's also a noticably different- and somewhat more polished- version that appears to be an XL/XE transfer of the version written for the 5200 console.[CR]The "5200" version appears on at least one late-80s Atari compilation (and possibly elsewhere?)[CR][B]AtariKSI, 31/08/2010[/B][CR]It's not that bad. I have played both Atari 5200 and Atari 800 versions and I prefer the Atari 800 version. The graphics are much cleaner looking and obviously the digital joystick makes things a lot more accurate to move things around. Trackball makes you doubt if you are all the way at the bottom or not given the rolling nature of the ball.[CR][B]rexreed, 20/10/2009[/B][CR]Ugh. I don't understand why this version is so lousy, especially after playing the 5200 port. The centipede moves very choppy and when you die there isn't even an explosion! Just a little static.

		<plot>[B]Jeff, 26/03/2011[/B][CR]HELP! This has been driving me nuts for years. I bought this the second it was available, but it was a different version: much simpler graphics (black sky), simpler chopper, simper tanks, etc. How come I can't find that version of the rom? Was it just that I was playing on a 16k 400 and it "knew" ? PLEASE HELP, PLEASE e-me. Give me peace. :)[CR][B]Scott Wozniak, 15/09/2008[/B][CR]Yes, this version will always be the one for me. This was a milestone when it came out, and I distinctly remember being in awe when I first saw the animation in this one. Ah, those were good times. 10/10.[CR][B]eppy2000, 10/10/2007[/B][CR]A very timely game, with the memories of the Iran Hostage Crisis still fresh in everyone's minds. IIRC, Gorlin said the game was inspired by the ill-fated rescue attempt. It took me 23 years to finally complete the game with all 64 hostages intact. :) Part of the appeal of the game as been mentioned are the actions of the hostages. They wave at you, and if you are unable to take them, they salute you, as if to say, "Godspeed." It might be cruel, but I always liked the animation when the chopper crashed down in a heap of twisted metal. With the hostages aboard, of course! [CR][B]Nixon, 17/04/2006[/B][CR]One of the first games i ever played, it really had an impact on me. the waving lil buddies hoping for you to rescue em really broke my heart :) i love it too 11/10 :P[CR][B]Uselessman, 17/07/2005[/B][CR]I have this version of Choplifter, great game, great colors, great seting, i love it.</plot>

Nice to know that some of you guys are still around![CR]You have no idea how many hundreds of hours my friends and I logged on this game back then. We were all addicted to "Clowns" and "Circus" in the arcades and your Atari 800 port totally nailed the essence of these games. It's also the best paddle-controlled game ever made for the system and still holds up today. I still talk to a lot of Atari 8-bit users and believe me, many people still play this game.[CR]So, after two decades I can finally tell you personally, this is an excellent game! Very well done.[CR]Best of luck to you, I'll check back in another 25 years...[CR][B]Sascha Buchner, 01/03/2007[/B][CR]thank you Frank for your great work on the 8-Bit Ataris. Me and my brothers spend countless hours playing your games. I wish you the best for your future.[CR]Sascha[CR][B]Frank Cohen, 01/03/2007[/B][CR]Wow! This was my first game. It brings back such great memories to see the screen shots, photos of the package, and even the cheesy ads from DataSoft.[CR]The game took me about 4 months to program. The last month was bug fixing and that was really painful. I had a hundred bugs to fix. One of the minor ones was I got the text wrong for the bonus round. When the game displays "Bonus Round" it would print "Butus Crewt" on the screen. I was working with Mark Rielly, Ron Rosen, William Robinson, and others at the time. They started asking me when Butus Crewt was going to be done![CR]I was all of 21 at the time. Now I'm 45.[CR]-Frank Cohen</plot>

		<plot>[B]Muffy St. Bernard, 03/07/2010[/B][CR]This game of avoidance, building, and destruction would be better if the controls were a LITTLE less complicated. You can do so many things when you push the joystick in EXACTLY the right mode, but switching and maintaining the modes takes some of the fun out of it.[CR]Kudos for trying to create a complex game that uses only a joystick, but maybe using the spacebar to switch modes would have been a more intuitive (and ultimately faster) method.[CR]Still, this one is unique and worth checking out.</plot>

		<plot>[B]Hawthorn, 27/02/2008[/B][CR]Wow, I could agree less with the other comments. I love Conan and Robert E. Howards written (I have even used his short stories it a lit class I teach) so if anything I wanted this game to be great. I've tried several times to get involved with the game and can't. The colors are crude and the game play tedious. Bruce Lee IS a great game and on a different level than Conan.[CR][B]Dave Grieser, 02/07/2004[/B][CR]Well written game design. As with any Datasoft game. Music is awsome! Game can slow down a lot in the fourth and fifth level. If you have installed the 256 upgrade, it runs great![CR][B]Andrew Bernstein, 27/05/2004[/B][CR]In terms of graphics, this is a straight port of the Apple II release. The strongest point of the conversion is the music which has been beefed up for the Atari 8-bit release (thanks to the Pokey chip) and is nothing less than a blast ![CR]A great, very playable, early title from Datasoft which would lead the way for other comparable (genre related) games like Bruce Lee later the same year (1984) and The Goonies and Zorro in 1985.[CR]Highly recommended.</plot>

		<plot>[B]Jonny EOL, 11/11/2006[/B][CR]A quality wargame that makes a fairly good job of dealing with one of history's more 'complicated' theatres of combat. Takes a lot of work to really get the most out of it, and your margins of victory or defeat were often quite small, but certainly worth a few hours of your time.</plot>

		<plot>[B]eppy2000, 12/11/2007[/B][CR]Not much originality here, just your typical rescuing the damsel in distress from a beast. It would be a decent game, but the graphics, sound, and gameplay are mediocre at best. It's difficult to gauge what your obstacles are and where it's safe to jump. You'll find yourself losing a lot of lives before you make your way through the game.</plot>

		<plot>[B]Baz, 30/09/2013[/B][CR]1988 was a depressing year as it became ever harder to find Atari games and that sad slow realisation that it had had it's day as a commercial concern, so getting any new games was almost like a miracle. So it was I acquired this one and was horrified by it's blocky graphics for such a late entry, but I recall this being a surprisingly fun game to play so it was acceptable.[CR][B]LS, 30/08/2009[/B][CR]Blocky graphics are not the best in the world, true, but other than that I remember this game being addictive, and quite challenging.[CR][B]The Targ of Utarg, 23/10/2007[/B][CR]I remember being quite fond of this game and it was one of the first I fired up after digging my old XL out of the attic. Despite the original poor review posted here; its actually not that bad a game. You run around picking up diamonds, trying to shoot (or avoid..) ghosts and police whilst attempting to find the code for the safe [CR]-sounds inane but its actually quite addictive and I was easily able to wile an hour away playing it. [CR]However getting through the annoying intermittent lasers to gain the code did test the patience and I gave up my fond reminiscing after that. Despite that it's not a bad effort and certainly one of the better Atlantis Software offerings. [CR][B]Jonny EOL, 11/11/2006[/B][CR]This was the game that had you shooting policemen and performing jail breaks long before anyone had heard of Grand Theft Auto. Sadly, that's where the similarities end - a simple but frustrating top-down 'arcade adventure' with blocky graphics and a childish feel - not that you'd want kids to be playing this. </plot>

Does anyone out there have a copy of this awesome game for the Atari 8 bit series?[CR][B]Rob, 15/09/2006[/B][CR]Cosmic Balance I was a really great "design it and fight with it" game. I can remember trying all kinds of weird designs just to throw at the opposing player or computer.

		<plot>[B]Muffy St. Bernard, 29/10/2012[/B][CR]It's not the complex wargame that it appears to be. You're a tank in a vertically-scrolling landscape, surrounded by terrain features, turrets (which shoot at you), and orange bomb symbols. You can destroy the turrets and bombs, though the turrets fire much further than you do. Use the stick to move your tank, hold down the button and use the stick to rotate your gun. You have a time limit, though sometimes the game ends with "Press Pause" for no reason that I can figure out.</plot>

		<plot>[B]Enrique Ganem, 09/02/2008[/B][CR]I played crossfire first on an Apple II (a $1,000 US machine here on Mexico). When I tried the Atari 800 version (a machine that costed me about 100 US back then), the difference in the general appearance was enough to make a friend of mine wince (he bought the Apple). The game is simple, fast and engaging. This was my first 1-hour game. Itś good to see it still around![CR][B]Muffy St. Bernard, 30/04/2007[/B][CR]The key is to find a "sweet spot" that allows you to duck away from enemy fire; try to minimize the time you spend on the edges (where you have fewer movement options). I always start in the middle column, second row from the bottom, and concentrate on killing the aliens staggered along the left and right edges; by getting rid of them you can reduce the number of directions that the aliens come from.[CR]If getting your replacement bullets requires ANY risk, don't do it...better to wait until the coast is clear, because ships are at a premium.[CR]Since you need all the ships you can get it's essential that you score points. The aliens are worth very little, so get EVERY bonus target when they appear (if you don't grab the lower-point ones, the higher-point ones don't appear). Save the final alien and just keep firing until the final 800-point target appears...you need it.[CR]Just zone out and stare at the center of the screen most of the time.[CR][B]Jim Kuchera, 13/12/2006[/B][CR]This game is so straightforward that it's learned in thirty seconds. Ironically, you can never conquer it because it just gets tougher and tougher. I have a friend from M.I.T. who claims this is the best mind game of all time. Don't believe it. It requires the best possible rapid (make that 'intense')hand/eye coordination, and you must turn off your mind completely. In some ways it's like shooting skeet, and that makes it incredibly addictive. It's more fun than PacMan because you get to shoot something rather than having to eat a ghost close up, you get to blast 'em from a distance. </plot>

		<plot>[B]thax, 19/10/2013[/B][CR]oh how they should of made A8 games this good all along. Im not keen on camparing against other machines as they each had strengths and weaknesses. My fave thing about the ole 8 bit machines is they still work great all these years on. my 2 800xl machines are 30 years old and they work perfect. my laptop is 6 months old and its become self aware and is having panic attacks and suffers from total do what it wants when it wants randomly disorder. even my zx spectrum plus 2 outclasses it.[CR][B]MrFish, 01/08/2010[/B][CR]Monumental achievement on the A8. Excellent graphic design throughout. Cool music. Play mechanics are also done well.[CR]It does lack some of the "Mario-esque" elements that would make it a little more interesting to play (i.e.: breaking bricks, becoming super, throwing fireballs). Also, I'm puzzled why fire was not used for jumping. Perhaps they had planned to use it for some feature that never came to fruition. Maybe there will be an updated version some day (hint, hint).[CR]Regardless... hats off to the developers for producing a platformer that raises the bar for any future games of the same genre.[CR][B]Divya16, 27/07/2010[/B][CR]You people claiming C64 superseded A8 are wrong! A8 was always superior and this game is one example of why but not many people spent the time/energy to take advantage of the hardware scrolls, palette switching, 64K+ memory, hardware collisions, etc. There's no hardware scrolling on Atari ST either. This game needs to fix the flicker-- it seems like a software issue.[CR][B]holgibo, 15/07/2010[/B][CR]A great game! This plattformer has everthing: Good graphics, great sound, smooth scrolling. I'm suprised the rating is under 9/10....[CR][B]Pierre André, 15/03/2010[/B][CR]I've always been surprised at how low a rating (7.x) the final version of Crownland has been getting. Especially considering this is as close the A8 got to the C64 in the platform genre (unless there's a title I'm not aware of). Any opinion ?[CR][B]Dan, 26/10/2009[/B][CR]OK, the sprites are really flickery, but the parallax scrolling is smooth and the graphics look really good as a whole (better than anything that I've seen on the C64, at any rate). The gameplay is very Mario-like, but that's not a bad thing.[CR]If Atari games had looked like this back in the '80s, the C64 might not have superseded Atari's computers so quickly.[CR][B]Tony, 13/04/2008[/B][CR]Great Effort, but possibly shows why this genre never caught on on the Atari 8-bit. The P/M graphics often get flickery and performance slows down in places. Could never compete with the NES[CR][B]Bill Kendrick, 28/11/2007[/B][CR]This game is a tech powerhouse. I've seen demos do some incredible stuff, but it's rare to see a playable (and fun!) game. This is more than I would have ever expected a jump-and-run to do on the Atari. Incredible work, guys![CR][B]Firkraag, 13/11/2007[/B][CR]Amazing and incredible! Bravissimo![CR][B]LS, 01/11/2007[/B][CR]Awesome![CR][B]Trocero77, 12/01/2007[/B][CR]As far I can remember this game is based on a game from c-64 called Maynhem or sth like this. But still is outsatanding...Bravo![CR][B]Andrew Bernstein, 24/12/2006[/B][CR]Very Impressive ! Not only does the gameplay rock (which wasn't the strength of the earlier *Bros* by K-Soft) but the presentation is absolutely incredible. Had it been released in the eighties, this kind of title would have put the XL/XE on par with competitive platforms like the C64 and maybe even more (I don't remember early ST platformers looking as good as this one). Can't wait for the final release (and I'm ready to pay for it... ha ha !).[CR][B]fretless, 17/12/2006[/B][CR]Oh...yes!!! Great playability, smooth animotion, a lot of emotions. I wish everyone more such games for Atari 8-bit. In my opinion --- outstanding! I am looking forward to hearing about releasing the full version of this game.</plot>

		<plot>[B]Kent, 12/11/2007[/B][CR]While the market penetration sounds like it was limited, per Dan’s comments, I for one enjoyed this game immensely. This was the first strategy game that got my adrenalin pumping and in a sense was an early foray into the RTS genre. I broke many joysticks trying to get my units on the board to counter an opponents move and for anyone looking for a challenging real-time strategy game for the 8-biy Atari this is it! In every case I can recall sitting back and feeling a little exhausted after each match and just when you think you have the game mastered, the AI would always come back and kick your butt back to PacLand. Kudos on this game Dan. It is an unsung hero in the strategy game genre and like many early ground breaking games, it never got the attention it deserved.[CR]If this game ever comes up on this site I will be once again be ending the lives of many a controller.[CR][B]martin, 05/02/2006[/B][CR]It is true, you can build and command units, battle against computer or a player. Command and conquer in it's genesis stage. One friend destroyed his joystick after being beaten, I expected him to win, the moral is dont laugh at losers when they shout "wagons Ho!!" and then get chewed up by superior strategy.[CR][B]martin, 20/06/2004[/B][CR]Fancy COMMAND and CONQUER for the atari? this excellent battle sim must have inspired someone..</plot>

Second part lacked possibilities to choose.[CR]Including all campy main characters from the Southfork Ranch in red/yellow themed pictures, a stampede and a ticklish python.

		<plot>[B]Bill Angove, 03/10/2012[/B][CR]I used to load this up when I was young, and I could never get the ball to enter the field of play! On replay in the emulator, it turns out to be a good game for the time, but nothing special compared to modern games of course.[CR][B]Jim Kuchera, 16/12/2006[/B][CR]It's hard to knock a game that plays so naturally and uses the paddle buttons. This game had the look and feel of the real thing, and for an old pinball freak like yours truly, I was lost in 'cyber fantasyland'. What fun. I miss this one, and wish I could scarf up a copy that would run on the old 800! A real cutting edge game.</plot>

		<plot>[B]Muffy St. Bernard, 26/11/2009[/B][CR]Wow, I typed this game in when I was a kid, and it didn't work! Now I can finally play it.[CR]Instructions (from long-ago kid memory and looking at the BASIC listing): travel through the caves and collect as much gold as possible, then return to room 1 and type 99 (ends the game, gives rating based on gold).[CR]There are twenty rooms in each level. When you enter a level it is randomly created. A "Dropoff" is a one-way exit to the next-lower level (type -1 to take it) and a "slide" is a one-way exit to another room in the same level.[CR]Each room has 0-3 exits (sometimes exits are one-way even if they don't say so). When trapped, use your wand (99) which creates an exit, or might backfire and lower your speed/strength.[CR]Attack monsters with 0 to gain experience and release some amount of gold (maximum amount is listed before you attack). To get gold, move to another room. Return to room 1 (on any level) and type 0 to trade experience for speed and strength (1:1 relationship).[CR]If "demons" or "gas" are in the room, each turn they have a chance of hurting you. You can't hurt them. There are also random chances of tremors which either trap you or rearrange the level.[CR]On lower levels, monsters are harder, you lose stats faster, but gold rewards are higher.</plot>

		<plot>[B]jcat, 26/04/2011[/B][CR]I remember when a demo for this was circulating - it was just the 3D grid surface which back then, was considered gorgeously-amazing. Everyone was waiting to see what the actual game-play would be like. There were so many delays, we all began to worry that Synapse had a tech demo with no game concept. Well, turns out we were right. The gameplay felt slapped on. Visually awesome, but a disappointed from the greatest 3rd party company back then. Hard to believe this was done by the same developer behind Fort Apocalypse.[CR][B]Paul W, 24/03/2007[/B][CR]pretty cool 3-d shooter although is does get boring after a while. I could never seem to find the end. Try encounter! first, then try landscape for a little more action.</plot>

		<plot>[B]Hillsy_, 11/10/2013[/B][CR]Great game. A classic. Managed to get to L6, but I could never finish it. Some of the jumps were hilarious! Fond memories of this one :)[CR][B]KrazyPengwin, 21/05/2013[/B][CR]As others have said, this is the best of the home conversions... despite Kong being on the wrong side of the screen.[CR][B]misterZZzzz, 17/05/2013[/B][CR]Great conversion, best ever.[CR][B]Daniel Thomas MacInnes, 16/10/2012[/B][CR]This is the best home version of Donkey Kong, and includes all four arcade screens (something missing from even the NES version!) and sterling gameplay. One of the Atari 800's crowning achievements.[CR][B]velde10234, 07/07/2012[/B][CR]This is by far the best version of DK for home computers. Except for the arcade version but MUCH better than on Coleco, 2600, 7800, ...[CR][B]Gwobby, 27/11/2011[/B][CR]Simply awesome. For fun try jumping the oil drum on the pie factory; also jumping off the platform ends into the screen edges is neat for avoiding barrels!![CR]http://www.freewebs.com/gwobby/[CR][B]rjohnson, 01/02/2011[/B][CR]Donkey Kong for the Atari 8 bit computers was the best Donkey Kong that was made except for the arcade version.[CR]The Atari 400 Donkey Kong has all four screens. Unlike the Colecovision, NES and Atari 7800 versions. It even includes the How high can you get? intermissions.[CR]If you want a damn good Donkey Kong, buy the Atari 400 version. You can find it and the Atari 8 bit computers on Ebay.[CR][B]AtariKSI, 31/08/2010[/B][CR]I like this over the arcade version and all other versions I have tried-- C64, Atari 7800, Colecovision, Coco, etc. Excellent controls, collisions are very good, and can't be improved much unless you stretch the screen.[CR][B]Jim H., 04/03/2010[/B][CR]Hi jlw! What "that other guy" is talking about is simply personal preference. I like this game a lot and play it regularly, I just feel that Atari could have done a better job with the movement of Mario going on and off the ladders. In my estimation its a little funky. On the DK Junior cart the movement has none of this stickiness and allows for split second motions. Just my opinion, though...Cheers![CR][B]jlw, 03/03/2010[/B][CR]I don't know what that other guy is talking about. This is the most playable version of Donkey Kong ever. This is the ONLY version where the barrels bounce when they fall. This is the best home version ever.[CR][B]Jim H., 19/02/2010[/B][CR]I'm surprised that all the comments here are so positive. While the graphics and sounds are wonderful, I have always felt that Atari could have done better with the playability of this game. Most notably the transitions off the tops of ladders onto the next platform...Mario often seemed to catch or freeze slightly before being able to move side to side, and at the higher levels even the slightest delay is often the kiss of death. I always prefered their Donkey Kong Jr. to this original.[CR][B]Fres, 26/07/2009[/B][CR]I'm with Greg B. on this one. The C64 version had some good playability, but the screens are all out of order. It's like the authors never played the original coin-op.[CR][B]Lane, 23/07/2009[/B][CR]For the time, this was an excellent port; though I prefer the Ocean C64 version ( http://www.lemon64.com/games/details.php?ID=750 ) . [CR]But it did have the benefit of coming out three years later.[CR][B]Greg B., 05/11/2008[/B][CR]Simply put, this is the best home translation of a coin-op game EVER. Period.[CR][B]wazoox, 08/03/2008[/B][CR]Read the fantastic story of the code from the programmer himself on his blog :[CR]http://www.dadhacker.com/blog/?p=987[CR][B]eppy2000, 18/02/2008[/B][CR]This was excellent as most Atari home conversions were. You had all four screens of the arcade version, plus you also got to see Kong fall on his head in the second screen level. It had everything going for it: good graphics and sound with smooth, challenging game play.[CR]The only problem was that it was released one year after ColecoVision got all the publicity (and sales) for its new game machine, which came with Donkey Kong! Coleco also entered the video game market and put out a laughable rendition of the game for the 2600. So when Atari finally arrived with their own, excellent version of Donkey Kong for the 8-bit, it got lost in the shuffle. It's still a classic![CR][B]Jonny EOL, 12/02/2008[/B][CR]Possibly the best 'home' conversion of this game I've played. All four of the screens, difficulty balanced just right (5 levels to choose from) and basically a convincing run through Mario and DKs first big hit.[CR][B]Flypaper, 15/08/2007[/B][CR]This version of the classic offers four complete levels. A very satisfying gameplay situation, since there were many others released for a variety of systems that lacked all levels. The graphics are a little chunky - to be expected with the Atari 8-bit generation - but the little extras more than make up for it. Top drawer from Atari's programmers. Highly reccomended![CR][B]vsc king (qtone), 15/06/2004[/B][CR]simply the best donk i have ever played. all 4 leves are complet and very fast. better than atari 2600 or 7800, Coleco or anything else.</plot>

One of the best games for Atari.[CR][B]Muffy St. Bernard, 15/11/2009[/B][CR]A bit difficult to get into, but it looks great and the sound effects are fantastic. The best part: no matter how he dies -- hit a bird, falling too far -- his head explodes. Why? Because Draconus has a terribly unstable head, is my guess.[CR][B]Lopik, 03/02/2008[/B][CR]With Mission and Robbo its the best game for Atari 800 - great graphics, very good gameplay, excelent music.

		<plot>[B]Gwobby, 26/01/2012[/B][CR]At last there's an NTSC version of DropZone available! Details here:[CR]http://www.atariage.com/forums/topic/193247-hsc9-round-1-dropzone/[CR]:)[CR][B]steve, 04/07/2009[/B][CR]Upon seeing and playing this game for the first time(all those years ago) it seemed to of come from another planet. The crisp graphics, sharp sound and incredible speed at which this game played blew us all away. The programmer pushed the atari's potential to the limit and then some. Upon the intro screen you know this game is not kidding. Today this feat of programming is appreciated even more greatly in retrospect. Outstanding game.[CR][B]ElB, 04/10/2008[/B][CR]Archer Maclean teamed up with another British legend, snooker player Jimmy "Whirlwind" White, and they had quite a franchise going for a while with jmplementations on a range of platforms. The relevance? Jimmy White's Cueball 2 for the PC has a Dropzone arcade machine in one of the rooms. :)[CR][B]Auntie Pastie, 22/03/2008[/B][CR]Byte; "All-American Software" was in U.S. Gold's logo because they started life as a UK distributor of games by American companies (Synapse, Datasoft, etc.) They stuck with that logo for quite a long time, even though it was no longer strictly true. As for Dropzone, it was a very well-developed game that had a real, quality "arcade feel" to it. Pretty hard though![CR][B]Byte, 21/08/2007[/B][CR]After reading the quote "in 1987 or 1988, I saw a double page ad for it in a US magazine and bought a copy to run on a US machine. It didn't look or play too good because it was tuned for a European machine, and it looked real bad, almost embarrassing" it's actually quite funny is seeing U.S. Gold use the phrase "All American Software" in the logo on the tape cover.[CR][B]Pengwin, 23/07/2007[/B][CR]One of my favourite games on any platform.

Sound=A Graphics=A Gameplay=A Note: If only the C64 guys could have seen this when we were comparing systems![CR][B]Atari 4ever, 09/04/2007[/B][CR]This is best games on atari 8 bit ![CR][B]Maggi1971, 01/01/2007[/B][CR]"Squeezing the hardware in the Atari 800 to its limits and making it better than anything else then available. What was more amazing to me was the challenge of making it work on the less capable Commodore 64. It was a real nightmare implementation, but I did it."[CR]Enough said. A true classic indeed (on the Atari!). Archer Maclean is still a programmig god for me. He designed only a few games, but he always kicked the players butt.[CR][B]Jonny EOL, 11/11/2006[/B][CR]I found this one a bit hard to get going on, but once I had a feel for it, there was no going back. The sheer quality of the graphics alongside the speed of gameplay offered an experience never quite equalled. Those trailer invasions and anti-matter balls, meanwhile.....[CR][B]Roger, 13/06/2006[/B][CR]How stupid of me, I was so excited that I found info on this game that I didn't even notice I could download this game from this website. Can't wait to get home from work and spend countless hours playing it again!!!!!!!!!![CR][B]Blair, 22/05/2006[/B][CR]Dropzone is one of the best 8bit games ever. The quality and attention to detail is amazing.[CR][B]Nixon, 17/04/2006[/B][CR]completely agree on that...it's the best looking shootin game at arcade speed that i ever seen on an 8bit atari ...maybe it is the best maybe some other game is ;)[CR][B]Lewis D'Aubin, 07/04/2006[/B][CR]The author's account of writing this game for 50hz PAL systems explains why the game runs so heart stoppingly fast on a 60hz Atari! Best Atari action game EVER. When this came out, I never played Defender again!!![CR][B]Houdi, 06/08/2005[/B][CR]Quite simply the best scrolling shoot 'em up of all time. Archer MacLean's 'Defender' clone was way ahead of its time using the Atari's superior capabilities and showing exactly why it was the best 8-bit machine ever produced. [CR][B]BrunoN, 28/05/2004[/B][CR]This game fucking rules. One of the best(best?) shootem ups on small atari. Incredibly fast paced game. And check that explosions :)</plot>

Control the golem with A. Use P to toggle fire and water.[CR]This was notable at the time as a stopgap before an official Gauntlet version appeared on the Spectrum...several "Gauntlet-alikes" were released (including a radical remake of Atari's "Dandy," the ORIGINAL Gauntlet) before the official one finally came along.[CR][B]lotek style, 06/04/2010[/B][CR]Pretty amazing game. About 20 years ago I would have known about the golem thing ;) ... I think I also finished the game completely... I was addicted and later changed my nickname to DRUID aswell :)[CR][B]Huska, 10/10/2009[/B][CR]Can somebody tell me, how to activate golem? Thanks.[CR][B]Robert, 28/06/2008[/B][CR]This is a great Gauntlet clone. It is not so big as Gauntlet but in my opinion it plays much better (more responsive). </plot>

		<plot>[B]Gwobby, 17/07/2011[/B][CR]Excellent game - a fixed version of Electrician is here http://atari.fandal.cz/detail.php?files_id=1826 :-)[CR]www.gwobby.webs.com[CR][B]TVzombie, 07/12/2007[/B][CR]I wonder if this version is ok... all of those i used freeze when trying to enter last house :([CR][B]Muffy St. Bernard, 20/09/2007[/B][CR]More notes: the underground maze is random, but I'm not sure if the houses are. Always connect levels from right to left so you can catch any possible TV sets (they always walk to the left). You can jump on snakes to stomp them, but they just pop back to life again. When rats are involved, it's possible to end up in an unwinnable situation...in house 7 the rats are fast enough to chew the wires as fast as you create them (on levels with lots of ceiling connections at least). Maybe if you scout all the levels at the beginning and hook up the ones with lots of ceiling connections first. If two rats catch you with their noses, you die.[CR][B]Muffy St. Bernard, 17/09/2007[/B][CR]The instructions (best as I can tell): In the "house" levels, you must lay electrical lines between each floor and connect them to the sockets above and below the floors. Hold down the button to lay lines, pressing up or down to connect to sockets. Jump by pressing diagonally, and climb up and down the ladders. Bats will pick you up and randomly drop you (possibly killing you), sparks follow electrical lines and will kill you. Snakes, spiders, and rats crawl around and destroy your socket connections; you can walk right through snakes, spiders kill you instantly, and rats will nudge you from the front end (but you can kick them from behind). When you connect a TV set, catch the walking TV set for a free life. After connecting all floors, go to the bottom of the building and connect a key. UNDERGROUND: The status bar shows the building number your key is for and the building you are currently at. Walk through the maze, don't touch the crocodile mouths. If a crocodile walks through a wall gap while on your screen, it leaves behind an "egg." Shine your light on it...it will either turn into a deadly creature that flies at you, or into a free life.[CR][B]neube, 12/05/2006[/B][CR]Awesome little game in which You get the job of an electrician. The goal of the game is to complete two types of rounds which come one after another - house - where You have to connect all the elevations in the building to the main power cords (watching out for bats, rats, spiders...) and second type - underground, where You have to avoid the aligators and carefully choose Your path on the 5-level underground with water at bottom one [B]but there is a cute little kanoe there :-)[/B].[CR]Awesome classic.</plot>

		<plot>[B]Gwobby, 13/03/2011[/B][CR]Electraglide is an excellent game once you master it - nice to have the adjustable steering modes. Challenging but completable (well on some circuits!), after the third tunnel the game ends. Beautiful sound and graphics too. Nice forks, tunnels and objects to avoid (use the brakes here!). The light steering paradigm is best for avoiding the objects but the medium setting is perhaps best for all round play, especially if you want to stay away from the tunnel walls!!! 9/10[CR][B]Greg B., 22/02/2011[/B][CR]Here's a great example of a game not being great just because it's on the cutting edge graphically and sound-wise.

The driving style required was tricky to get to grips with, but once mastered, the game was possible to complete. A personal favourite, for sure.[CR][B]Nixon, 17/04/2006[/B][CR]Elektra Glide truly featured a breathtaking 'somehow 3D' engine at a real fast speed combined with a kick-ass BGM 10/10</plot>

I particularly loved the different types of ships you'd start seeing on later levels, each with their own AI. Ships that constant shot out a stream of missiles, others that ticked and suddenly exploded. I was never a fan of the "fly through the void" stage, but the tank portion was great.[CR][B]Michael Gardner, 26/04/2007[/B][CR]This is one of the best games of its time, i remember sitting for hours playing this game on my atari 800xl in the 1980s. the graphics moved smoothly and quickly and the whole game was a joy to play. [CR]i still have my atari 800xl and every 6 months or so i dust it down and see if it still works by loading encounter.(not bad for a 25 year old computer).[CR][B]Paul Westphal, 22/04/2007[/B][CR]This is one of the best first person shooters for it's time.The graphics may not be flashy by todays standards, but it more than makes up for it with clever AI and a smooth engine.Sometimes the enemies can be downright frustrating to defeat! great fun![CR][B]Andrew Bernstein, 26/09/2006[/B][CR]Published three years before the official Battlezone port by Atari US, Encounter puts Atari's latter efforts to shame (no offence to Ken Rose who did quite a good job with Desert Falcon later on). What Paul Woakes did with Encounter was nothing less than groundbreaking at the time. Sure, there were 3D apps before (Sirius' Capture The Flag is a great exemple) but Encounter presented non only a super smooth engine (animation and game controls were second to none) but especially broke away from linearity. In comparison, Dimension X published the same year didn't even do this ! No surprise that the US publisher of Dimension X (Synapse) eventually bought out the US distribution rights for Encounter. Bullseye !</plot>

		<plot>[B]Anna Tariuser, 29/05/2007[/B][CR]Mediocre game with three distinct stages; a multi-screen platform game (nothing special), a horizontally-scrolling shoot-'em-up/collect-and-transport-survivors type thing (better, but control a bit frustrating), and.... as soon as the third stage appeared, my ship always blew up, so I have no idea what it's about.

		<plot>[B]dominic trill, 20/04/2008[/B][CR]I agree with Thorsten, Flak is a lot more fun. This has the makings of a good game but doesn't keep your interest as it gets very repetetive very quickly. Better than some others though..[CR][B]Thorsten Günther, 01/05/2007[/B][CR]I beg to differ. If you're looking for a quality vertical scroller: choose Funsoft's "Flak". In comparison, "Espial" looks like a 2600 title.[CR][B]Jim Kuchera, 04/04/2007[/B][CR]This is a great scroller, not unlike Xevious. It's an arcade clone, and a fine one with smooth action play, and excellent music. It's certainly in the top 10% of Atari 8 bit titles, and worthy of consideration. Not to mention the fact that this game is really a lot of fun to play.</plot>

		<plot>[B]thax, 19/10/2013[/B][CR]Always thought this game was actually quite good, if you waited a few minutes on the title screen, pressed reset then the game would play with the music continuing. cracking tune, I have my 800xl rigged into a pro logic cinema amp and sounds totally brill.[CR][B]Marius1976, 28/05/2011[/B][CR]At first I had the same opinon as Dan, but now I have been playing this game the last few days, and I think it is still a cool game! [CR]After the complete 6x3 zones the game is finished, so that is a goal on it's own. [CR]As a Kid I had this game on tape. It looks good. Controls are a bit 'slow' and the shooting is sometimes not accurate. At this moment the game has 5.2/10 ... I think that is too low. I'd give this game a 7.[CR][B]Dan, 26/10/2009[/B][CR]Nice parallax scrolling! The game itself, though, is unplayable - the ship is stupidly slow and quite massive, making it nearly impossible to dodge enemy fire.[CR]The music is a rather terrible cover of the Sanxion soundtrack on the C64.[CR][B]Wes, 24/09/2008[/B][CR]Gameplay was quite dull, although the parallax scrolling was quite nicely done. But it's worth playing just for the music...!</plot>

		<plot>[B]Daniel Thomas MacInnes, 09/05/2011[/B][CR]The Microprose combat games just ROCKED. F-15 Strike Eagle was the best of the lot, by far, with all the cool options and weapons and missions. I only wish a two-player mode could have been included, like Spitfire Ace and Mig Alley Ace. The Atari 800 had a lot of solid flight sims, now that I think about it.[CR][B]gilgar, 05/06/2009[/B][CR]im not picking on it and im serious it is just the flight engine from stor riders with a blue and green BG abd im just stating that the oversaturation of games caused by lack of legal protection from companies copying one another caused the game market to crash[CR][B]Gwobby, 03/06/2009[/B][CR]This has always been one of my favourite games; used to wait for ages for a copy of this to load from tape on a mates 800XL and then find out we didn't have all of the authentication codes! Play on arcade mode to get started but then go on to one of the other modes for more fun. Especially satisfying launching missiles and diving down and bombing a target. Thought I'd stick up for F15 as the other comments are not so positive - I've played this recently and still enjoyed it. You have to resist cheating when you run out of fuel by holding down the A key to keep firing the afterburners:-D[CR][B]gilgar, 02/06/2009[/B][CR]the thing about it the atari could do a LOT more look at rescue on fractalus or eidolon or ballblazer or road race or well i could go on for ever its weird how every jack shamk went to game makin and wanted to get rich oof some poor clone of an older game and wound up wreking the videogame market this is more like 2600 starider clone with a cockpit overlay and a ble and green background[CR][B]eppy2000, 01/09/2008[/B][CR]I remember buying this game after reading a highly favorable review in Antic magazine. But I was a little disappointed, given the description that the game was developed and tested by real combat pilots. [CR]The Atari's hardware limitations restricted the game's realism. The simplified graphics and sound also took away from the fun factor. Occasionally it was disorienting to play without crashing or missing the intended targets, so I always played in "arcade" mode to make it easier.[CR][B]Hawthorn, 27/02/2008[/B][CR]I agree with Jonny EOL especially the WAS part. This WAS a great game but one which just doesn't stand the test of time--the ultimate of tests for a top 100 list. F15 adds nothing to the genre now. Too many better simulations now and too many great unique games for Atari to have this in the top 100.[CR][B]Jonny EOL, 02/07/2007[/B][CR]This was quite a neat simulation of F-15. It lacked a landing and takeoff sequence, and 8-bit micros could never handle the graphics simulations like this deserved, but it was a worthwhile simulation challenge nonetheless. </plot>

		<plot>[B]Artifice, 11/07/2012[/B][CR]Hello, i'm also looking for the solution of this game i've never finished. In english or in french, they are very closed. If you have this solution please send me an email at artifice [B]at[/B] efrei.fr, Thanks ![CR][B]grenwald, 28/09/2010[/B][CR]well[CR]You're very lucky to have such solution ![CR]In France, game have been released on 4 disk sides,but I never managed to finish the first disk.[CR]If you know where I could find a solution like yours,it would be great. I'm frenchso I don't have problems with this language (maybe I could hep to make an english translation)[CR][B]Andreas Koch, 25/09/2010[/B][CR]Well,[CR]one of the authors also created an english version of this game and sold it a) as a demo/freeware version (with 2 disksides) and b) as a fully commercial version (with 5 disksides).[CR]I do have the solution for the french version (but I don`t own the french version!) and err, if you are good in both english and french, all you have to do is translate the french solution into english and voila. Tried it with the first two or three steps and it worked that way with the english version...[CR][B]grenwald, 23/09/2010[/B][CR]I spent a lot of time on this game when I was young. A lot of puzzles and specific sense of humor.[CR]Still now, i launch the game sometimes just for the fun.[CR]Unfortunately, I never manage to finish it, so if someone have some guides to this games, it would be very great if I could have some helps.[CR]Anyway, this game is still in my favorite top list of games[CR][B]Vince, 25/09/2009[/B][CR]Game in french only but for me the funniest game ever, and my first real adventure game (next : tomb raider and resident evil).[CR]The game was very long to charge and it was a test to pass, quite difficult for a young boy, to prevent copy. If the test was failed : game over, 10 minutes to reload, an eternity.[CR]The game begins in a jail. You have to get out. The game understands words as "look at the wall" "regarde le mur" in french and it answers "i can see a brick bad scelled" so i write " take the bick out the wall" it answered "now there is only a big hole", so i said "look inside the big hole" and it said something like that : "how rude you are !!! You are fired of the game !!!" [CR]I think the progammers have laughed a lot to make this unpolitically correct game. Lot of humour and kind of british nonsense.[CR]I never managed to finish it.[CR][B]Andrew Bernstein, 26/09/2006[/B][CR]FREE has to be one of the most humorous Adventure games on the 8bit Platform. It's way above other French efforts like Akanis Ula and Chimère (both by Pressimage) and especially a *lot* of fun to resolve. For years, I heard of a sequel or spin-off but has it been ever started ? Let alone published ? Anyway, this game is quite recommended... Just make sure you have a French / English dictionary handy !</plot>

		<plot>[B]Gwobby, 02/01/2012[/B][CR]Found this info for Fire One which is an excellent game so get playing ;)[CR]Synopsis by Matthew House[CR]From the arcade and onto the Commodore 64 comes Fire One, a shooter involving two rival oceangoing fleets. In order to win, you must take control of one fleet and demolish more units than the other. Beforehand, there are some options to consider. There are two settings: Admiral and Ensign. While the Admiral setting is best suited for novices, Ensign is for seasoned veterans.[CR]Also, the time can be altered from one to 99 minute battles.[CR]Once the settings have been made, it's time to eradicate the enemies. Action takes place at the bottom of the screen as rival units cruise around the water. Your fleet is located at the top of the screen. No action takes place on this portion of the screen except for automatic animated results of enemies' attacks.[CR]As enemies cruise around, you must launch torpedoes towards them. Enemies include carriers, hydrofoils, cruisers, mammoth battleships, oil tankers and the elusive PT boat. To destroy one of these foes, the crosshairs must be aimed in coordination with the target's location. The aiming mechanism features two lines: the horizontal line represents that direction the torpedo is fired, and the vertical is for precision and location.[CR]While a torpedo may hit the rival unit, it might not sink it. In order to sink a foe, a direct hit must be scored. Direct hits involve firing toward the middle of the target. When a direct hit is scored, bonus points are awarded. Points are also awarded when a torpedo comes in contact with a rival unit.[CR]When time has expired, the round is over. A win scenario involves sinking more units than the computer-controlled fleet; a loss is rendered when the computer has demolished more units. The win/loss screen is shown and informs the would-be general as to who has won more rounds [CR]*** Checkout my Atari website www.gwobby.webs.com ***</plot>

		<plot>[B]Baz, 01/10/2013[/B][CR]A game I remember with utmost fondness partly because it was the first XL game I ever completed. It was really smooth and challenging but not overly difficult to make one give up in frustration... very exciting to reach that inner fortress or whatever it was one had to bomb their way down the levels to get to then having to fly back out to where one had started whilst trying to rescue the little running men. Had plenty of action. Loved it.[CR][B]GeoMan, 14/05/2013[/B][CR]Great game! At a later level there was a message on a wall: "Steve was here!" or something like that![CR][B]Benden, 12/02/2012[/B][CR]This game is a masterpiece. At the time, it was one of the most polished game ever published. Awesome graphics/sound/gameplay.[CR][B]Underfly, 13/01/2012[/B][CR]One of Atari 8Bits most rememberable games. This gets very challenging, and pixel perfect planning, but watch your fuel![CR][B]Daniel Thomas MacInnes, 09/05/2011[/B][CR]If ever a game demanded an expanded mission pack, it's Fort Apocalypse. I never understood why Choplifter got all the attention. This game was far better in every way. It wasn't even close. Games like this really sold kids on home computers, and it wasn't long before our 2600s were collecting dust.[CR][B]jcat, 26/04/2011[/B][CR]Another Synapse masterpiece. I use to play this, Pharaoh's Curse and Necromancer DAILY! Makes Choplifter look ill.[CR][B]Rockford, 15/11/2010[/B][CR]I really loved this game back in the eigthies! This is one the best Synapse titles (And they sure had a lot of great games!!).[CR][B]Scott Wozniak, 15/09/2008[/B][CR]Thank God I never read the review from Electronic Fun until now. They're nuts. This game ROCKED. My only knock was that it was too short. Synapse Software sure had some talented programmers. CLASSIC. 9/10.[CR][B]Robert, 27/06/2008[/B][CR]For me this is simply the best helicopter game for the Atari 8bit. Forget Chop Lifter, HiJack and the dreadfull Airwolf/Blue Thunder and play this one instead :-P[CR]Even I completed it several times, I still boot it up sometimes.[CR][B]Jonny EOL, 24/04/2008[/B][CR]A great helicopter rescue/shoot'em'up. Pity about there being only 2 levels. The interview on this site gives the reason, but it's a pity there wasn't a 64kb disk-based sequel. [CR][B]Ben Combee, 24/01/2008[/B][CR]Also published in 1986 by Green Valley Publishing, a division of ShareData. Disk number is ZRG-0779-1.0.[CR][B]JohnM, 06/08/2007[/B][CR]Love this game too, very addictive gameplay.[CR]My only complaint after playing it so many times was - I need more levels[CR]- Give me a level editor to add more[CR]- Give me an expansion pack[CR]- I just need more of the same :)[CR][B]Andreas Koch, 22/07/2007[/B][CR]Well, I love this game. Allthough I solved it a dozens of times, I still play it today. Atari released some of the Broderbund and Synapse titles for the XE/XEGS on cart. in the late 80`s - oh how I wish they would have released this one also...</plot>

		<plot>[B]VD Tonic, 18/06/2014[/B][CR]That's what you first think when you play the game. But you won't make it past the 4th or 5th wave with that "tactics". Every level has got its pattern and you need to figure them out in order to succeed.[CR]Only downside is that there is no level selector so you always have to play from the beginning. You can cheat adresses $6019 and $6027 though to start at the desired wave.[CR]I like :)[CR][B]gwobby, 06/06/2014[/B][CR]Are you guys serious?!!!! - I seem to remember just being able to wiggle the joystick round to play with no skill required whatsoever 1/10![CR][B]VD Tonic, 30/05/2014[/B][CR]In my opinion one of the most underestimated games on the Atari. This easily could have been an arcade classic. Once you have understood the concept the gamepplay is as dense as Missile Command, Qix and other Atari classics. My lately rediscovered favourite.[CR][B]thax, 19/10/2013[/B][CR]ive owned this game since its release and loaded it maybe twice. no amount of brainwashing would makeme want to load it again. should be a basic game.[CR][B]Auntie Pastie, 18/10/2008[/B][CR]Having never played it at the time, I was surprised to find out that Frenesis wasn't *quite* as awful as its reputation suggested. Not brilliant or even particularly good by any means, but there's a mildly interesting and original game concept in there, even if it does get repetitive fairly quickly.[CR]The other thing that lets it down as much as anything is the execution; with its flat and crude use of character-based graphics (even down to the use of the default colours!) it looks and plays like a moderately-interesting type-in game. (Or at least 5 years older than it is). The sound is annoying too.[CR]Still, I've played worse.[CR][B]Jonny EOL, 12/11/2006[/B][CR]Almost universally regarded as one of the least interesting games in history, Frenesis essential involves moving a bar to protect another bar from diamond and butterfly shaped enemies. It's all very abstract, and it's all very boring. </plot>

It makes Atari's version look even worse than it is.[CR][B]Greg B., 22/12/2008[/B][CR]Considering the year it was released, this program is a minor miracle. It's such a good version of Galaxian that it could have been stuck into arcade cabinets. An absolutely stunning program.[CR][B]FastRobPlus, 03/08/2007[/B][CR]Great game! Bought it on eBay the other day for $10.00. That's a bargain![CR][B]Jim Kuchera, 15/01/2007[/B][CR]Galactic Chase by this company is what Galaxian should have been when Atari themselves produced this in cart form factor. The game is as good as it gets, and load entirely in one pass, into RAM. Play action is fast, predictable, authentic with just the right sound effects. An original copy of this game on disk sold the other day on eBay for $10.00. That's a bargain. The IBM ports of this game just don't have that same touch that it has played on a vintage Atari 8-bitter. If you find it for the 8-bit, buy it, and don't look back. You'll not regret your purchase.

		<plot>[B]Jonny EOL, 11/11/2006[/B][CR]It looks pretty BASIC (sic) but this is actually an incredibly well-designed and relatively complex strategy game set in outer space. You have to take over a number of planets in a 1000 year time span, building up your military force, recruiting troops, scouting distant systems and taxing your occupied planets. A real 'epic' - possibly the pinnacle of what has been achieved in Atari BASIC.[CR][B]onky, 15/08/2005[/B][CR]This game brings back good memories.... It really is an immersive strategy game, giving orders to the crew and trying to be the ruler of the galaxy by building up forces and attacking planets.... [CR]Another great thing was that I learned programming basic through this game. I often loaded it up to peek in the entire listing of the game, trying to find out what was happening and what commands did....</plot>

		<plot>[B]Daniel Thomas MacInnes, 16/10/2012[/B][CR]I loved this game and played it endlessly on the Atari 800 back in 1982. Fast and challenging, looks very close to the arcade, and lots of fun with a Wico joystick.[CR][B]Jonny EOL, 27/01/2008[/B][CR]Ah - the first computer game I ever played! This turned out to be a relatively authetic conversion of the arcade hit - trying to get those 'combination' kills for big points was always a challenge. These days, I take the difficulty up to 9 and see if I can last more than one wave!</plot>

		<plot>[B]Baz, 01/10/2013[/B][CR]I remember this being a huge hit in the arcades and being enthralled watching people play it, pumping in more coins to keep on going, so a home version seemed promising thanks to it's multiplayer capabilities. Unfortunately, this was a thorn in my side because I could only play with my brother and he and I could never agree on anything other than the time and even then it would be with reservations, so you need not guess the screaming matches the pair of us had trying to play this as he would try and do his own thing whilst screaming at me demanding to know why I was doing what I was doing and vice versa. It got so bad, our Mum banned us from playing it![CR][B]Troy McClure, 02/08/2012[/B][CR]The copyright date is based on the arcade release. The actual UK Atari 8bit release was most likely in 1987 - there is a review in AtariUser 26 (June 1987) and there was also a preview earlier that year.[CR][B]Jonny EOL, 24/04/2008[/B][CR]I used to play this with my brother a lot, but I think I liked it more than me. For some reason it just got tedious a little too quickly.[CR][B]Hawthorn, 18/02/2008[/B][CR]Hard to support a game that was a rip off of an earlier game Dandy (and they didn't pay the original concept designer). Still a good game but doesn't hold its own over the years like its sibling games for Atari (e.g., Spare Change).[CR][B]Ben Combee, 24/01/2008[/B][CR]This has a 1985 copyright date and came out in the US either that year or the next.[CR][B]Andrew Bernstein, 20/09/2006[/B][CR]Gauntled for the XL/XE was probably the only game actually funded by the European label US Gold for the venerable Atari platform. Sure, the development was done by Gremlin Graphics but the financing was on the publishing side of things as it was an 'expensive' franchise to produce (in comparison, Gremlin only produced non franchise games like Trailblazer or Footballer Of The Year). The same kind of publisher / development house collaboration took place again with the terrific Star Wars conversion done by Zeppelin Games on the behalf of Domark.[CR][B]penge, 06/05/2006[/B][CR]a great game in its time, predecessor to dungeon master.

		<plot>[B]Jimmy Biggler, 06/11/2007[/B][CR]This game kept me entertained for hours on end as a kid and still does today. It's sort of the Grand Theft Auto of the Atari world minus the sex and violence.[CR]This game is definitely in my top 5. It's endlessly enjoyable, presents a decent challenge, and is extremely addicting. If you haven't played it yet, you don't know what you're missing![CR][B]Mark Reid, 01/09/2007[/B][CR]Hey, thanks for the nice comments guys. I just stumbled across this site, so I don't know if Marty still cares after all this time, but my email is: reidme(at)suddenlink.net[CR][B]Matt, 24/07/2007[/B][CR]This is among my favorite video games of all time. Endlessly entertaining![CR][B]Ed, 07/07/2006[/B][CR]Marty and others....the levels exist only in that you can keep getting progressively more valuable bonus items to pick up by hitting the white van.[CR]Hearts, rings, chalices, I don't recall the exact order, but after collecting all three and hitting the van again, you move on to the next set and things speed up.[CR]I still love this game. ;)[CR][B]Nixon, 17/04/2006[/B][CR]i love getaway..playing it now gives me the idea that games like gta really came a long way...btw this ones better then gta :)[CR][B]Marty, 28/10/2005[/B][CR]Does anyone know where the instructions for this game are available? It's fun to play, but I'm wondering if there are any "levels"? I know that there is only the one map, but do I ever get to clear it completely, or do I just keep collecting cash until I'm out of cars?[CR]Also, does anyone know how to contact the author, Mark Reid?</plot>

		<plot>[B]Pengwin, 28/08/2012[/B][CR]Loved this game back in the day. Still do. This is one of the rare games I had on tape that was worth waiting waiting for it to load.[CR][B]big-bang-attack, 09/12/2008[/B][CR]Brilliant game! Played it to death 20 odd years ago but couldn't complete it. Got it on emulator and completed it in 20 mins! At last I can die happy!![CR][B]FastRobPlus, 05/10/2006[/B][CR]Ghost Chaser is a great introduction to Frank Cohen games, and pre-Nintendo era platform games in general. Controls were touchy then, and they are touchier still on emulators, which can be frustrating to players used to slightly more forgiving modern platformers.</plot>

		<plot>[B]Baz, 30/09/2013[/B][CR]I found this to be one of the easiest games of all to play. It was a fine way to kill half an hour and one always got a thrill from the speech synthesis at the beginning. One of the few games I managed to complete 100%! The reason why I didn't get 100% in more games was largely down to the painfully slow tape loading times which was the Atari's one big letdown, especially if it crashed before it finished loading or worse, you ended up with a stinker of a game... this wasn't a stinker. It was fine.[CR][B]Greg B., 16/11/2008[/B][CR]Well, it might have been highly polished but it was a total snoozefest. I always thought this game was absolutely AWFUL but that's just me, I guess.[CR][B]Just Me, 16/09/2008[/B][CR]Tip found on the web: use "GOO" as name then 11111111 as account number.[CR][B]Jonny EOL, 24/04/2008[/B][CR]This was from back in the day when film spinoffs didn't always suck. The intro screen with a karaoke lyrics, the kitting out of your car and the challenges you'd meet round the city all point to a highly polished product.

Did I just see a rainbow effect? :)[CR][B]http://gwobby.webs.com/, 10/10/2010[/B][CR]Nice satisfying game. Only downers are first screens are too easy and second screens are too hard when the ships start flying across at speed you pretty much can't kill them before they crash into you. Great fun annihilating the Flag Ships to see how few pixels you can leave, yes I'm sick mwah ha haa haaaa Shoot the pixels for bonus points too![CR][B]Paul Westphal, 13/05/2009[/B][CR]Sorry, I forgot to mention that the prototype "Blaster" is also very simular as in it has different 'phases' to it, but is also excellent in execution.[CR][B]Paul Westphal, 13/05/2009[/B][CR]This HAS to be one of the more faithful arcade to home conversions. The sounds (as I remember them) are spot on. What the hell happened to the 5200 version? It sucks compared to this. Controls? Check. What a blast...play this and Wizards of Wor and be in for a great deal of gaming fun.[CR][B]Jim Kuchera, 28/01/2007[/B][CR]I expected great things from Roklan software after seeing this game, and Wizard of Wor. Both games are excellent ports of the arcade versions. What I find engaging in this game is that it includes a Galaxian-type of game action, then moves unto two additional scenarios. I lost lots of quarters in the late 70's playing this sucker, and am glad to enjoy it in the 8-bit format. Every time I load this game, I could swear that I hear my Atari 800 go, "Thanks, I needed that." YOU need this game. It's easy playability will draw you back again and again. Go have some fun.</plot>

		<plot>[B]gwobby, 03/05/2014[/B][CR]Very good overhead racing game with cars that you can actually control! Graphics, Sound, and Music, all very good too. Track 5 is excessively hard but if you stay close behind the computer car on lap 1 you can overtake him on the short loop near the end of the lap. Great fun in 2 player mode where the computer car joins you both.[CR]www.gwobby.webs.com[CR][B]Jonny EOL, 20/03/2009[/B][CR]Given that Codemasters will release an official F1 game later this year, it's amusing to look back to this thing. Two rectangular cars racing round 12 different circuits. Despite the rubbish-looking cars, it was enjoyable enough as a poor mans 'Super Sprint' and sufficient practice did allow you to get further than you did the previous play. Also featured voice synthesis - not the best quality but, hey, it was a pocket money game in the 1980s, and served it's purpose well.</plot>

Good graphics, excellent use of night and day along with weather conditions plus one could pick which routes to take. No two games were the same, so it was always an enjoyable challenge that I played many many times that captured my imagination... it felt believable. It has a dear place in my heart in my life of computer gaming.[CR][B]John, 04/12/2011[/B][CR]This is one the best racer of the 8-bit era!!![CR]To Steven D. - the story about the cover car is so cool![CR][B]Steve D, 29/09/2011[/B][CR]The cover is my old Camaro / Gulstrand Showroom Stock road racer.

[CR]The photography was done out on Pt Reyes at about 90 .[CR][B]Cubretti, 06/09/2010[/B][CR]When I was a boy I never get to the NY. Recently I turn on XL emulator and set the "collapsing cheat ON". Since then, my car is no longer being stopped by anothers and I finally reached the NY and got a top rank! That was awesome!!! Greetins from Russia to all.[CR][B]Heaven, 22/06/2008[/B][CR]not only was stunned by the "3d zooming Activision logo" at the beginning but as well of the game itself... loved Enduro on the 2600 and this takes it far beyond... played it over months and months thank god that the highscores got saved to disc...[CR]thumbs up! a real classic.[CR][B]John E., 16/01/2008[/B][CR]My mates and I used to play this game and when one of them managed to get on the scoreboard before me I was absolutely devastated! As has been said: true classic.[CR][B]Yungstar, 30/10/2007[/B][CR]a group of friends owned this disk and we used to pass it around to see who would get ranked higher on the score boards. [CR]a classic for it's time. day would turn to night as you raced, rear lights would shine as you approached other traffic, weather would change a AAA of it's time[CR][B]eppy2000, 08/10/2007[/B][CR]I loved how this game required more strategy, combining elements of both Pitstop and Pole Position. I particularly enjoyed having to race during the night or various weather elements. It was fun trying to race as fast as possible without crashing into other cars. And it was a nice touch having the police on your tail if you got out of line! One of my favorite tricks was starting the race later so when I reached the final leg, there would be little or no rush hour traffic to slow me down.[CR][B]steve, 26/07/2007[/B][CR]Best 3d racer on the atari. Great sense of speed conveyed, great narrative also, quick the cops, push to pump!!! Best racer for the atari hands down.[CR][B]tou, 19/06/2006[/B][CR]fantastic games,[CR]Alain of France[CR][B]jac_Cac, 07/08/2005[/B][CR]Nothing to add. BrunonN's 100% right.

God bless you.[CR][B]Muffy St. Bernard, 09/11/2008[/B][CR]Oh yes, and since there aren't any instructions here, you just need the joystick and fire button to play. Move your joystick down when you're on solid ground to drop a stick of dynamite, then get out of the way fast.[CR][B]Muffy St. Bernard, 09/11/2008[/B][CR]Love it! Like many Activision games it is original, colourful, and deceptively simple. You can get into it right away.[CR][B]Scott Wozniak, 15/09/2008[/B][CR]Legendary game. Highly original and still tons of fun to this day. 10/10.[CR][B]Archie, 25/04/2008[/B][CR]Agree with Flash. Great game! Spent a lot of hours playing it.

		<plot>[B]Muffy St. Bernard, 08/11/2009[/B][CR]This game is DAMN FUN![CR]Since there are no rules: You have a tongue that pops out of your head, always upwards. You can only eat green centipedes with your normal tongue, you can crush eggs with a brown hat on your tongue, and you can kill the "woka woka" with the white hard hat. Centipedes can't hurt you but they will knock your hat off, which can be disasterous. The woka woka kills you.[CR]Each level you are given the number of "eggs" and "walls" you need to tackle. Crush the white eggs with your hard hat (which you grab from the bird). The "walls" are scrambled wall sections that are fixed when you walk near them. After all eggs are crushed and walls fixed, the next section starts.[CR]Red things always kill you. During some sections the bird carries you elsewhere; to disengage, touch the white platform. Woka wokas hatch out of uncleared eggs. It is best to kill as many centipedes as you can at first, so they don't steal your hard hat later.[CR][B]Andrey Sergeev, 03/03/2006[/B][CR]This was one of my favorite games on Atari - it offered many different types of gameplay, with big and interesting world to explore. I never seemed to get tired of it. Great game, with a lot of taste.[CR]Basically, you control a bug-like creature (Willy, apparently) who could use its long lashing tongue to collect the eggs, kill enemies and even use it as a transport - you could stick your tongue to a bird flying by, and get transported to a different place. Based on this premise are varied and imaginative tasks you had to accomplish. The game is mostly about exploration, and to a certain degree - about reflex and skill. A good combination of these two factors made it so fun and satisfying experience.[CR]Highly recommended![CR][B]Matt Walsh, 29/03/2004[/B][CR]This was an extremely imaginative and fun game with a great deal of depth. It also got pretty hard. This is the type of game you'd never see released nowadays.</plot>

		<plot>[B]Frank, 14/10/2010[/B][CR]Great game[CR][B]eppy2000, 09/10/2007[/B][CR]Until this came along, Star League Baseball was my game of choice when it came to baseball. It was very innovative with the classic centerfield camera of the pitcher and batter. But once the ball is in play, it becomes like any other baseball game. It had quirks, like being able to have up to six outs. Or balls thrown from the outfield REALLY slowing down to indicate distance. Or not being able to go back to base once you've committed to stealing. It had one great feature missing in today's baseball games. You can substitute positions players as pitchers (something that does happen, if rarely, in the big leagues). Another great thing is that if you place players in positions other than their own, they're more prone to making errors.</plot>

		<plot>[B]cawley1, 25/06/2014[/B][CR]I would LOVE to know why Ocean did not release this at the time it was ported? Colin Porch also wrote the C64 and 16-Bit versions.[CR]When you think how prolific Ocean/Imagine was in the 8-Bit era, for us to only get Green Beret and Arkanoid from Imagine, and NO releases from Ocean, it's a crying shame.[CR]If they had taken a punt on it, and it did well, who knows what other titles they might have released...[CR][B]Jonny EOL, 11/11/2006[/B][CR]Despite the monochrome graphics, this isometric graphic adventure was still one of the best overall games I've played on the 8-bit. The two different characters you played (Head and Heels) and their differing capabilities added an extra level of variety to the challenge. BTW - there's an authentic remake for modern platforms out there somewhere.[CR][B]Kaminari, 05/02/2006[/B][CR]Head Over Heels on the Speccy is largely hailed as the best isometric 3D action/adventure game ever. It's a shame that the XL port was rather barebone and definitely not taking advantage of the machine in the graphic or sound departments. Yet it has a charm of its own and the original gameplay remains intact. It could have been a better conversion, but it's still an excellent game as it is.</plot>

		<plot>[B]jamie o, 02/02/2014[/B][CR]I remember getting this on a cold winters night and playing until 2am..well late for an 8 yr old.Easily one of my favourite games and also one of the first i completed,happy times indeed.[CR][B]william, 22/05/2013[/B][CR]impossible to get pass screen two well for me anyway[CR][B]Hayley, 03/07/2011[/B][CR][CR]Game soundtrack was amazing- and it was probably one of the first games i completed. Graphics were pretty good, and it was very playable- tough, but not impossible.[CR]Possibly one of Masteronics best[CR][B]Gruppenfuhrer WOLF, 15/09/2010[/B][CR]I remember waiting for the end of holidays to play Henry's House again at home.[CR][B]Colin Baker, 23/02/2009[/B][CR]Absolutly brilliant game for its time, and it still holds a lot of good memories, although at times it was incredibly frustrating! Still well up there with my favourite games of all time, even today.[CR][B]Roberto Rodriguez, 07/02/2009[/B][CR]The greatest retro game of all time in my opinion. The controls are spot on and the level design is borderline genius! [CR]The only slight disappointment is that there isn't an ending screen - you simply loop back to the first level.[CR]However, you can't really complain with what's here. I didn't touch this game for about ten years but was surprised by how well it holds up today. I still hate that damn bird though![CR][B]Jonny EOL, 12/12/2007[/B][CR]Essentially the game Jet Set Willy should have been. A colourful and highly enjoyable platformer. [CR][B]Michael Strorm, 25/10/2006[/B][CR]Great game; even by 1987 standards it seemed like an "old school" platform game, but it was done so effectively. I was particularly impressed with the second screen.[CR]I didn't find out until later on that it was a conversion of an English Software C64 game from a few years earlier (Mastertronic must have had a deal with them; I think they converted ElektraGlide to some other formats.) It explains the homages to various games of that time.[CR]Ironic that the JSW-influenced sprites on one screen of HH look really nice, and the graphics on the "real" Atari JSW were atrocious. Oh well :-/[CR]There's not that much difference between the C64 and Atari versions (Atari has a slight edge), except that the music in the Atari version is better :)</plot>

		<plot>[B]Baz, 01/10/2013[/B][CR]One of those odd games I got given for Christmas one year that I spent many hours struggling to complete, never getting to the end of the final room. Looking at the screencaps isn't refreshing my memory at all well so it's one that's gotten a little hazy over the years. It wasn't brilliant but must had had something about it for me to load it up many a time.[CR][B]Daniel Thomas MacInnes, 17/10/2012[/B][CR]Aha! At last! I had this game on a floppy disc back in the '80s. It was buggy and would crash, so I never got to actually play it. The opening chords would ring, and then my guy would fall through the floor. The weirdest part of Usher? The "game over" screen, and it's cryptic message:[CR]"The real Earl of Usher is Spider-Man."[CR]What the hell is that?! Does ANYBODY know what that was supposed to mean?</plot>

		<plot>[B]Hillsy_, 11/10/2013[/B][CR]I'll just go borrow Jake's lawnmower... Great game, Dog's loyality :)[CR][B]eppy2000, 09/10/2007[/B][CR]High kudos for taking something everyday (mowing the lawn) and making an original game out of it. I like how you have to deal with two angry neighbors and a not-so-man's-best-friend hot on your heels as you try to complete the task. The use of the music is terrific, it's a very relaxing theme -- almost a music box quality to it.[CR][B]Jonny EOL, 08/04/2007[/B][CR]A game about nicking your neighbours lawnmower and cutting the grass before he manages to grab it back. You can always set the dog on him, but the rebellious canine often seems to prefer mauling the mower. And steer clear of those flowers, unless you want the gardeners on your tail too! This game was pure Minter - a silly premise turned into a playable game. Colourful graphics and pleasant pastoral music were both in evidence, and game was playable for a while, too.</plot>

		<plot>[B]littleman jack, 20/11/2010[/B][CR]Very fun game. It's also very addicting, one of those games where you keep hitting start to try and do a little better.[CR][B]Gwobby, 20/11/2010[/B][CR]Wow nice to hear from the author of one of my all time favourite Atari games! The version here has some additional corruption, there is a better copy of the game here http://atari.fandal.cz/detail.php?files_id=2083 which was the 'happy hero hacked version' that now has the proper text re-added. We played ixion in the high score club on atariage recently http://www.atariage.com/forums/forum/60-8-bit-high-score-club/ would be nice to hear from you![CR][B]Fred Mack, 17/11/2010[/B][CR]The corrupted graphics Gwobby refers to is an artifact of using character graphics to display the player, enemy tank, and background tiles. Before each new tile pattern is displayed the code combines the player and enemy tank graphics with the background tile. This is done for all possible positions of the player/enemy as it moves over tiles. But it does not take into account that player and enemy can occasionally occupy the same character cell. It was not practical to generate all possible combinations of player and enemy tank occupying the same cell. So when they get close you can see one overwriting the other and get a cell that should have both player and enemy tank but only has one.[CR][B]Gwobby, 21/08/2009[/B][CR]Great game, really playable, check it out! The copy here has some corruption on the graphics but this doesn't spoil things too much. There is another earlier(?) version available elsewhere that has transparent balls and less bullets and is missing a few sound effects but it doesn't have the corrupted graphics. Both excellent![CR][B]John E., 14/01/2007[/B][CR]Does Fred Mack still love Colleen Lorenz? If you type WHO DOES FRED MACK LOVE? this is what it says![CR][B]Fred Mack, 02/08/2005[/B][CR]In the original version the copywrite line read "(C) 1982 SEGA". I don't know if they still work in this version but there are 3 Easter eggs in the original version. Type "Who programmed this game?" (without quotes, with question mark) at the startup screen and the copyright line changes to "PROGRAMMED BY FRED MACK". There are 2 similar things you can type. Sega never put our names on the boxes so I had to sneak it in. I am still making games today.</plot>

		<plot>[B]eppy2000, 06/06/2014[/B][CR]I don't recall the game being pulled, because the book "Hackers" said that Sierra actually won the case. But Ken Williams (who owned Sierra) found the victory a bit of a double-edged sword, because he realized that it would potentially allow other developers to do the same thing to his company (e.g., release similar themed, "copycat" games with no legal repercussions).[CR]That said, this game was another one of John Harris' classics. I would've loved to see the prototype, which was actually the source of all the legal hoopla because it apparently was closer in appearance to Pac-Man than the finished product.[CR][B]Jim Kuchera, 16/12/2006[/B][CR]I just can't say enough good about this fantastic Pac-Clone. It is fast, has wonderful graphics, cute between scenes 'tooth brushing', and serves up superb sound effects. But, sadly, it was pulled from the market when Mother Atari went after On-Line for being too close to PacMan. Jawbreaker was re-released as Jawbreaker II. It sucked, was unplayable, and simply a waste of time. Thanks, Atari, for thinking about the rest of us. From my point of view, this game and Mousekattack are wonderfully playable and fun to watch. I miss this one. Note the price: $39.95. I can't believe we paid that much for games in the early 80's. Today, that would be about $150.00 in 2006's dollars. Wow! Ah heck, it was worth it. If you can find this disk somewhere, buy it, and pray it'll still boot. It's very efficient code, and loads in a matter of seconds with no further disk access. Consider today's games for dedicated game consoles, and you'll see what efficient code is all about. I miss these great programmers. Geniuses! All of 'em.</plot>

The original monochrome graphics from the original Spectrum have been enhanced with PMG overlays in a very tasteful manner. In terms of difficulty, the first four levels are quite easy but as soon as you get to the fifth stage... it becomes much much more difficult. Not to be forgotten is a wonderful music track by Miker which makes the playing exercise even more energetic. Hard to believe this is a 2007 release...

It was so addictive and challenging.[CR][B]David Cady, 27/07/2009[/B][CR]This has been one of my most favourite games for the Atari 800XL. Actually, I'm playing games very rarely, but usually the classical 8-bit pieces amuse me the most. And this game does it every time.[CR]BTW - I use the emulator due to the savestate feature.. Prooved to be handy a couple of times already ;-)[CR][B]Greg B., 04/11/2008[/B][CR]Anthony Ramos, GREAT point you made. This was always one of my favorite aspects of the game - you're in this big universe and are totally on your own! And I've had the JV version of this since the week it was released and STILL didn't beat the damn thing yet. And Anthony, in it's own way, this game is just as innovative as Myst. A real mind-blower at the time...[CR]And guys, look for my Atari 8-bit review site, hopefully appearing on Digital Press soon. I plan to review just about every 8-bit game ever made and have about 300 capsule reviews done already...[CR][B]eppy2000, 15/10/2007[/B][CR]This was good for its simplistic nature, but also for the occasional frustrating puzzle! The ruby chain planet was also my greatest nemesis. That one took me 14 years (1984-1998!) to finally figure out. Remember, once you obtain the stick and boulder, you have to take both back the area where your ship is. You "ride" the stick by pushing the joystick upwards, while holding onto the boulder. That takes you to the other side. You should be able to figure the rest from there. There are youtube videos on this, too.[CR][B]Bill T, 15/10/2007[/B][CR]Anchors aweigh my boy! More exquisite weirdness for your Atari home computer. As a kid I was very adept at all of the planet puzzles, EXCEPT ONE. The one with the lightning hitting the indentation in the ground. IT DROVE ME INSANE! I never solved it and it haunted my entire life. As an adult I managed to figure it out, once! And then beat the game... but on subsequent plays, I still can't figure out what the heck I did! AHHHHHH!! Guess that mental block is there to stay. Evil, evil...[CR][B]Travis, 03/10/2006[/B][CR]Wow, I love this game! I had first played it at a friend's house when I was something like 10 years old and had always thought flying through space and landing on other planets was cool. My friends used to play it on a black and white TV screen and would have to guess where to land on some planets! I was always confused as to why the game made it so ambiguous (doh). I could never recall the name of this game, so a few nights ago I went through an entire list of Atari games, one by one, until I found it. :-)[CR][B]Mark, 15/03/2006[/B][CR]This was one of my favorite Atari computer games. I always hoped for a sequel. The puzzles were both strange and challenging. I concur with Anthony. There was this lonely "me against the universe" feel to it.[CR][B]Anthony Ramos, 27/11/2005[/B][CR]I love the mysterious, solitary feel of this weird little game. Kind of an 8-bit precursor to Myst![CR][B]kris, 28/09/2004[/B][CR]A very challenging puzzle game that make you think quite hard about the solutions. I recall there were 3 planets in particular that I worked on for several years before coming up with the answer!</plot>

		<plot>[B]Jim H., 29/07/2011[/B][CR]I agree with Jim K. Jumpman is easily in my top 5 Atari 8 bit games of all time. Considering it has some of the most primitive looking graphics, the game is insanely fun and addictive, and bares repeat playing. It also has a real sense of humor in the way the Jumpman moves and dies! Minimal looks, maximum fun![CR][B]Jim Kuchera, 16/12/2006[/B][CR]Author Randy Glover is a genius. This game, amongst thousands for the Atari 8 bit, rises to the top '5' in my book. Incredibly addictive, and wonderful mazes to negotiate as you pick up your jewels. The move from maze to maze was challenging enough, but not so much so that you'd boot something else. Sound effects are stellar. And who knows how many levels there are??? When Jumpman takes a tumble, you'll feel his pain (ala Bill Clinton) all the way to the floor as he bounces off numerous 'thingies' on his way to loss of life. Then again, maybe he doesn't really die because he has stars over his head when he hits bottom indicating that he might simply be knocked unconscious! If you find this game anywhere, get it. Climb any ladder, jump any stream, follow any rainbow. Hmm, sounds like a theme from Sound of Music! Sorry. Great game, just great!</plot>

		<plot>[B]Shannon, 26/01/2012[/B][CR]I think someone might be getting the 7800 version mixed up with the 2600 version (floating eggs).[CR][B]marquisor, 03/09/2010[/B][CR]Agreed. This one is the very best port of the game on homecomputer/consoles.[CR][B]AtariKSI, 31/08/2010[/B][CR]I prefer this over the Atari ST, 7800, and others that I have played. Although graphics look better on ST/7800 in paused mode, this game is all about moving objects and those graphics look like blobs except on Atari 800. Eggs are better done with better gravitation rather than flying around as if they were balloons. Collision detection is right on and very good sprite multiplexor given A8. Control is excellent.[CR][B]Gino, 06/08/2009[/B][CR]I remember this game - it was a blast to play with friends.[CR][B]Hawthorn, 18/02/2008[/B][CR]I also agree that the conversion is not as good as the original--understandable given the 8-bit capabilities. I can't see ranking this game very high when the Atari repertorie has so many excellent unique games that stand the test of time.[CR][B]Mike, 11/12/2005[/B][CR]Couldn't agree more Nick. I played this a lot in the 80s. My cousin Jayne used to moan when me and her brother used to have the computer on all day and she'd want to watch the tele, but when she saw Joust we couldn't get her off it! Two player mode was great fun, especially Gladiator rounds. We used to enjoy teasing "the hand" in the lava, see who could hover above it the longest without being dragged in.[CR][B]Nick Di-Perna, 06/12/2005[/B][CR]Again, another arcade game conversion which I prefer to the original. Graphics are cruder than the Arcade and Atari 7800 versions but the ease of control amounts to a much more playable game, more suited for armchair Jousters like me. It doesn’t get much better than this on Atari 8-bit home computers and that’s without even trying the simultaneous two player option. 9/10</plot>

		<plot>[B]Daniel Thomas MacInnes, 10/05/2011[/B][CR]A very solid maze game with a number of unique twists.

I always enjoyed this cart as a kid, loved the diversity (floods, anteater), and the game was always challenging. A very solid 7/10.</plot>

		<plot>[B]Gwobby, 12/04/2011[/B][CR]Excellent Berzerk clone - more playable! Nice touch of bonus points for doing the levels quickly. The baddies only materialise on the top and bottom edges so they can be avoided![CR]www.gwobby.webs.com[CR][B]Atarileaf, 18/09/2009[/B][CR]I just picked this up and am really impressed by what I originally pegged as a poor Berzerk clone. The speed of the enemy bots is very impressive and the game is fast and fun. Highly recommend. I didn't know this was R8. Wow, good find for me :)[CR][B]Denis, 04/07/2006[/B][CR]I bought this as a kid with my own money since I couldn't get to the arcarde every day to play Berkerk. I loved this game. I still play it (so do my kids).[CR]I would like to see the bytecode come off the ROM and into a Wondows virtual machine that runs the same processor as the Atari so I could play it on the pc (my Atari 800 doesn't run reliably anymore). Although it lacks the graphics and is a very monotonous game from today's standards, it's still more challenging than any game I owned since (Nintendo NES, Play Station, Gamecube). People are amazed when they see how fast the droids move in sector 7 -- which I often reach but can't hang unless I get a real lucky terrain.[CR]I recommend this game to anyone who liked Berzerk.[CR][B]martin, 05/02/2006[/B][CR]This Berzerk ripoff cost £30 as a cartridge and for it's challenge and impression was entirely worth it. Only thing I dont like is robots suddenly materialising on top of our man. No evil Otto or voices but sheer playability.</plot>

		<plot>[B]GeoMan, 17/07/2011[/B][CR]A classic! If you want to really enjoy games like this avoid USB and buy a PS/2 mechanical keyboard (like Filco). I still use one from 1995...[CR][B]Daniel Thomas MacInnes, 09/05/2011[/B][CR]The game is probably unplayable now, thanks to the sluggish controls that are always a full second behind the action, but Karateka was HUGE back in the mid-80s. It was a very cinematic game, which was highly unusual for the time. Think of Karateka as the warm-up to Prince of Persia.[CR][B]Kris, 16/01/2010[/B][CR]Other than the guys that you could kick in the face repeatedly, I struggled with this game and could never rescue the girl.

Just curious if anyone else did...[CR][B]eppy2000, 06/10/2007[/B][CR]Another classic. This came out on the heels of other martial arts games (and the movie "The Karate Kid"). But this one had originality, partly because of the story element. I always got a kick out of the "alternate" ending. It was a nice, if unsuspecting feature. I sometimes would play the game all the way through just to see it. It was also fun to make the hero fall off the cliff yourself. *THUD!* Or deliberately running into the gate so you could get skewered. :-)[CR][B]odi, 16/09/2007[/B][CR]fantastic game! animations and spots between - revelation[CR][B]Marcos Olivares, 06/08/2007[/B][CR]Prince of persia ?

What this person is referring to is if you approach Mariko (the princess) in battle stance, she'll deliver a single kick to the head that kills you instantly. Makes ya wonder why she couldn't beat the crap out of Akuma and his cronies herself..[CR][B]Maggi1971, 01/01/2007[/B][CR]One of the best Atari (8-Bit) games ever. The first game were I felt that this piece was more then a computer game. The gameplay was much slower compared to IK, but this wasn´t the point. Everyone was talking about IK, but I loved the gameplay and the story of Karateka. The animations just blew me away. Jordan Mechner is a story teller, and a very good one too. I just remember the amazing cutscenes. Absolutly brilliant and stunning. I tried to beat the game with a joytstick, no chance at all. Then I tried it with the keyboard. With that opportunity the game was a laugh, because the movement was now 100% accurate. Try to reach the princess and DON`T run to her.

		<plot>[B]spookt, 15/12/2008[/B][CR]I just tried this out after finding a post about the PC remake on AtariAge. What a great game! It gets pretty tough but it's really addictive. Check out the link in the comment from 'Weps' or http://www.kennedyapproach.com for a great PC remake, or even better bust out your real hardware and take it for spin ;-) [CR][B]Weps, 13/11/2007[/B][CR]Absolutely amazing game. Easy to learn, tough to master. Like pacman and tetris. Syntesized speech, nice graphics and fantastic gameplay. [CR]Once made for the C-64, Amiga and Atari, but never remade. That's why I made my own, for pc, go try it: http://www.marck.info.[CR][B]eppy2000, 06/11/2007[/B][CR]It's a fun simulation, sort of giving you a taste of what real air traffic controllers have to deal with. It starts off easy enough, but pretty soon you find yourself having to land multiple planes and routing them correctly so there are no casualties! That's where the game gets a bit nerve wracking. The voice synthesis actually works to the game's benefit. The slightly artificial, garbled voices makes it sound like real transmissions.[CR][B]Gideon Marcus, 05/11/2007[/B][CR]Surprisingly fun. Easily sucks up several hours of your day.[CR]My only question--are planes supposed to conflict even if they are at 3 and 4000 feet?[CR][B]Yungstar, 30/10/2007[/B][CR]one of those games that is as playable now as it was 20 odd years ago. a worthy classic.[CR]i never owned a disk drive (yep, slow tapes Zzzzz)until i had seen this game in action, a week later and i was in heaven. great speech, easy to play and hour upon hour of fun.[CR][B]Jokin, 01/08/2007[/B][CR]At last I got it. I was hooked and I may get hooked again.[CR]I'm missing the old joystick![CR][B]Pengwin, 23/07/2007[/B][CR]For what is essentially an arcade air traffic controller simulation, Kennedy Approach is very addictive. The added bonus of the speech is brilliant.[CR][B]Nixon, 17/04/2006[/B][CR]a quite realistic airport controller program featuring a real ingame speech effect...commands like altitude, course etc. all been digitized...though it seemed to me the answering pilots ony been able to say ****ROGER****...if ya want to hear your ataris voice this one is a must try..:D (my daddy loved it i remind )</plot>

		<plot>[B]Baz, 01/10/2013[/B][CR]A fave of mine which I mastered. It had a curious cheat where I think if you started by holding the joystick to the left as the green light or sign said go occurred (I can't remember... was so long ago!) then you automatically started off at full speed. That was a nice help on some levels and I loved jumping and speeding through the air only to have to slam on the brakes for those obstacles where one had to go slowly![CR][B]Jason, 22/06/2013[/B][CR]I remember the tape version taking 20 minutes to load![CR][B]Hayley, 03/07/2011[/B][CR]Goodness my favourite game! Managed to complete all of it without crashing once- and great 2 player mode as well.[CR][B]lotek style, 01/04/2010[/B][CR]Still have some pretty nice memories about this one! Great game![CR][B]Roberto Rodriguez, 07/02/2009[/B][CR]While this game is difficult to get to grips with, it's worth the effort. Flying through the level without crashing is a lot of fun and I've spent many hours trying to beat my best times! It's just a shame that the sequel didn't appear on the Atari 800 as it had a great level editor.[CR][B]Adam Cruickshank, 24/09/2007[/B][CR]Many happy hours spent playing this game with my brother.[CR][B]John E., 08/09/2007[/B][CR]Nice little game, especially in two player.</plot>

		<plot>[B]Stellar Jetman, 31/07/2011[/B][CR]Absolutely brilliant little RPG-like game, with great atmosphere and a lot of cool ideas. The best of the Lucasfilm fractal games, and my all-time favorite on the system.[CR][B]Boman, 11/09/2010[/B][CR]Oh my God![CR]the graphics are amazing : O[CR]I love it.[CR][B]Tim, 04/04/2010[/B][CR]a mind blowing game, havent seen anything as original or mind blowing since!!![CR][B]FrakAttack, 29/08/2008[/B][CR]@ Andreas Magenheimer - Thanks for the info. Bought my copy in W. Germany and always wondered why the game locked up toward the end. The thing I remember most about this game is that in one of the later levels, the mountain range on the mini-map spelled out "SEE LABYRINTH," a reference to the (at that time) upcoming movie. [CR][B]Retro Kid, 05/10/2006[/B][CR]Another of the great Lucasfilm games. Although I never got the high rifts, it was great hunting around looking for the ships and having to deal with those annoying saucers. But the best part had to be robot that would analyse your artifacts in the mother ship. One of my top 10 Atari games.[CR]Well done Georg for the remake, I've just downloaded it and can't wait to give it a go.[CR][B]Georg Rottensteiner, 19/09/2006[/B][CR]A shameless plug for my Koronis Rift remake:[CR]Get it at http://www.georg-rottensteiner.de ;)[CR]Contains the original rifts plus a few unlockables of this great game![CR][B]Andreas Magenheimer, 06/08/2006[/B][CR]Please note, that the european version of Koronis Rift is not fully playable due to bad copy protection. The guys at Activision placed the copy protection on a used data sector, ouch... (at least thats what I read in some german magazines)... -Andreas Magenheimer.[CR][B]Crosis, 01/04/2006[/B][CR]Completly Agree! I remember spending HOURS as a kid playing this game to try to make it to Rift 20, then i find out Rift 20 is pretty anti-climatic that all you do is use your scavenger to destroy the "base" which is nothing more than just Hulks laying around that you must find cause your radar does not work. all the pictures show a screen, the 5 display screen up top that i could NEVR figure out what module displays that output. PC Remake needed!![CR][B]John, 22/03/2006[/B][CR]Only one of the 3 greatest games ever released, that's all.[CR][B]John, 24/12/2005[/B][CR]One of the greatest games written for any machine that can play games!</plot>

		<plot>[B]LS, 03/09/2009[/B][CR]As a fan of Dariusz Bartoszewski's trademark hi-res graphics, I can only reccomend this game, if you miss it before! Not only it looks good, it also plays well. Environment is detailed and diverse. Disk version has animated intro.[CR][B]BrunoN, 24/05/2004[/B][CR]Very cool game, kind of hi-res Zybex clone. Not much worse than original (and environment of game is much more diverse than in Zybex). Despite hi-resolution its fast and dynamical. Sound is bit bare, but it wasn't big problem for me.

Hence I have happy memories of it and rate this highly.[CR][B]Daniel Thomas MacInnes, 18/10/2012[/B][CR]Leaderboard Golf is pretty much the definitive video golf game.

		<plot>[B]Fred, 12/04/2013[/B][CR]Tom Hudson tells the story behind Livewire! here:[CR]http://analog.klanky.com/funstuff.htm[CR][B]eppy2000, 25/03/2008[/B][CR]Like so many other machine language programs from ANALOG, it was usually a decent clone of an existing commercial or arcade product. In this case, of course, it's Tempest (which, for some unknown reason, never saw the light of day as a home conversion). This game does give you pretty much the feel of Tempest, although it's not as frenetic and sometimes the guys don't seem to get killed when you shoot at them, thus causing your own demise. I think this is more of the result of vector-based games being poor conversion candidates for home play. For instance, Star Wars and BattleZone were two great arcade games that looked and played very poorly on the 8-bit.</plot>

		<plot>[B]Jonny EOL, 07/03/2009[/B][CR]Well-Presented and nicely executed shooter but SWAT means 'Special Weapons And Tactics' which is over-egging the 'walk up the street shooting thugs and avoiding civilians' type of gameplay. Good for a quick play but I thought it lacked longievity.[CR][B]Roberto Rodriguez, 07/02/2009[/B][CR]In my opinion, one of the best games for the Atari 800. You work your way up the screen taking out anyone in your way (apart from the old ladies!) and dodging grenades / snipers. At the end of each level you have to rescue a hostage. It can get quite repetitive but the difficulty level is just right. The Spectrum version is awful so stick to this one![CR][B]Chris, 25/04/2008[/B][CR]Great game, if not a little simple though! I loved playing this even more when I discovered I could play audio cassettes through the atari tape deck when this game had loaded![CR][B]eppy2000, 07/10/2007[/B][CR]A fairly entertaining, if somewhat violent, shoot 'em up game!</plot>

		<plot>[B]http://gwobby.webs.com/, 19/07/2010[/B][CR]This game is much underrated, the unbuggy tape version works fine, the disk version here corrupts on room 10, but you can play 2 player and use the 2nd player ok (apart from 1 life). It's a bit like Berzerk or Shamus, gets very intense later on but has lots of nice features. Watch your feet as your head can pass over many dangers, and shoot things from a distance, use the whips (fire when not moving) to break through the walls.</plot>

		<plot>[B]Daniel Thomas MacInnes, 08/05/2011[/B][CR]The greatest video game ever made for the Atari 800. Whenever I see a new computer or game console, the first question in my head: Can this baby run 4-player MULE?[CR]It's worth getting yourself an Atari 800 (or a Sega Dreamcast, cough, ahem) just to play this. Double Bragging Rights if you have this game in its original "record album" packaging. EA had such terrific covers for their games back in 1983.[CR][B]Greg B., 26/02/2011[/B][CR]One of the best multi-player computer games EVER. RIP Dani Bunten.[CR][B]Lars Henriksson-Kruse, 23/02/2009[/B][CR]M.U.L.E. was one of the best games ever, for the 8-bit scene, this one, together with Lords of Conquest, Jumpman and a few others made my childhoot;)[CR]/Lars[CR][B]Enrique Ganem, 09/02/2008[/B][CR]My favorite game ever. Nice graphics (and music) and a design that encourages cooperation. If you do not try to gobble up a certain resource (like smithore), the robots will behave more or less decently. I regularly win, and the colony makes 70,000 points or more, when I do not try to monopolize a resource. Some emulators (like atai800 under linux) are a little slow, even on a 64 bit computer. Again, some emulators have a switch that allows you to use real-time emulation. I love the music, and it sounds ok only with r/t emulation on.[CR][B]Heaven/Taquart, 09/08/2007[/B][CR]Great...Great...Great... reason for me searching for an PAL 800 (not XL) just to get the chance to play it with my mates...[CR]a real master piece![CR]Kudos to Dan(i) Bunten for this all time classic. would be perfect for Xbox live! arcade version... sad that she can not see what a great game she designed...[CR][B]Jim Kuchera, 02/04/2007[/B][CR]Well, here we go again. M.U.L.E. sold today without packaging, even in the wrong sleeve,with no guarantee it will work for $179.00 on eBay. It just shows one more time that there are folks who regard this game as legend. They right! By the way, an oddity is that the cycling of colors and hues in the opening screen within the word M.U.L.E. uses GTIA graphics which replaced the CTIA graphics on earlier Atari 800's. I think I'll go to my 800 and boot this bugger up just to hear the music, and let the computer play itself. Even THAT is fun! What a marvelous piece of history nearly 30 years old! Thanks again, Dan(i) wherever you are.[CR][B]Jim Kuchera, 13/12/2006[/B][CR]An unopened copy of M.U.L.E. sold on eBay last week for over $300.00!!! It's worth it because this game is the best multiplayer game ever made for the Atari computer. My sons and I used to have a ball playing this together, and what a great learning tool!!! If you've got a youngster who you believe could be a C.E.O. (or even C.F.O.) someday, then this is the game for you. Bunten was a true gift to the 'industry', and his/her presence is sorely missed. Buying an Atari 800 off eBay is worth it just to play this game. But don't pay $300.00 for a copy of M.U.L.E. unless you already own a Lamborghini![CR][B]Nixon, 16/04/2006[/B][CR]A real cool game indeed, esp. the random events etc. i liked much about it[CR]..and one of the few early games involving a female programmer (Danielle Bunten was her name think)[CR][B]Mike, 17/01/2006[/B][CR]Couldn't get my brother off this one. It's a good, fun game in itself when you play it on your own, but when there's two or more of you playing it comes into it's element. Then the trading becomes much more interesting as you charge the earth for your fellow competitors to get what they need. It's ruthless! </plot>

		<plot>[B]Jim Kuchera, 16/12/2006[/B][CR]I agree with Aaron's comments. The original configuration of this game was two titles---not one. It was called "Stratos", and the flip side, "Maurauder". I still have the original disk somewhere. Nice use of Sprites and Player Missile Graphics. Yes, it's a dumb game, but nicely playable, and held up to return visits. That makes for a very good one player game.[CR][B]Aaron, 29/11/2005[/B][CR]PartI is a solid, fun game, but part II is rediculously fun at very high difficulty. So much stuff to shoot my 130XE would seriously lag stepping into a new room...</plot>

		<plot>[B]Daniel Thomas MacInnes, 16/10/2012[/B][CR]The best home version of the original 1983 Mario Bros coin-op. In a perfect world, Nintendo would allow it to be reissued so today's players could enjoy its brilliance.[CR][B]Paul Westphal, 07/05/2009[/B][CR]This is one of the best arcade translations for the 8-bit Atari. It rates right up there with Donkey Kong. Right on S.S., another example of GOOD programming.[CR][B]Mr.West, 02/07/2007[/B][CR]The best home conversion I have seen yet. Wish all the conversions had this attention to detail.[CR][B]Nick Di-Perna, 07/12/2005[/B][CR]Considering the difficulty locating a copy, I was initially somewhat disappointed by this version due mainly to its lack of speed - I could play the faster Atari 7800 version all day. I’m now beginning to appreciate the subtleties in the former and realise despite its slower speed, timing and skill are as important as in the other version. A classic despite a couple of flaws and presentation is second to none as mentioned. 8/10.[CR][B]Justin, 17/09/2005[/B][CR]I have to agree with Mr. Bernstein on this one. I in fact prefer this version to the NES, mainly due to the fact it includes the enemy introductions that the NES version lacked.[CR][B]Andy Bernstein, 18/05/2004[/B][CR]This is the best version of Mario Bros on the XL/XE - very superior to the 5200 release of 1983. No surprise it's been developed by Sculptured Software... Thank you Steve Coleman !!!</plot>

		<plot>[B]Kevin, 17/03/2011[/B][CR]Memories!. Like this game alot, LOVED the music![CR][B]Lockett, 12/05/2009[/B][CR]That has less to do with the Atari having a better soundchip and more to do with the Atari having a better programmer.[CR][B]Maggi1971, 01/01/2007[/B][CR]I loved this game. The gameplay is very poor (just fly trough the gates and hit the right tones), but the soundtrack from Russell Lieblich blew me away. Many people thought that the C64 had the better soundchip. Just play this one on the Atari and compare it to the version for the C64. The soundtrack (yes, there is a different track for each level!) sounds much better on the Atari. Thumbs up![CR][B]Randy Johnson, 09/08/2005[/B][CR]A classic! This was one of those memorable and original games that really used the 800's graphic and audio muscles to the fullest.[CR][B]Daniel Cádiz, 06/02/2005[/B][CR]This game is one of the most originally and funny games that I've played in Atari. And the music thats very good and gives a plus to the game.</plot>

		<plot>[B]Paul Westphal, 11/03/2014[/B][CR]The best thing about Activision games is their packaging. The carts were really small and had great labels. The box art was cool to.[CR][B]Daniel Thomas MacInnes, 09/05/2011[/B][CR]I disagree. Activision dumped a lot of 2600 games on the Atari 800, but never bothered to pump up the graphics significantly, or offer new gameplay modes. These guys put the absolute minimal amount of effort into these ports, and while the gameplay is still solid, it always felt like a disappointment.[CR][B]Paul Westphal, 13/05/2009[/B][CR]Much better than the 2600 version, as the enemies had more detail. Gets tiresome after awhile though...</plot>

		<plot>[B]JR, 14/10/2013[/B][CR]Anyone know how to get this actually working using Altirra? Preferably with the 64k Version.[CR][B]Baz, 01/10/2013[/B][CR]Of all the XL games I played, I think this was the most impressive technically thanks to it's impressive graphics, speed and open world nature where one was free to explore at ones own pace. Great fun sometimes loading it up to mess around a la GTA, shooting and watching the buildings collapse. [CR]Despite that, I did manage to complete this entirely without any help or hints. Took a long time to crack it but it felt wonderful when I finally escaped and won. A stunning achievement for it's time. I didn't play the follow up because by then I couldn't get hold of it but did play later episodes on the Amiga which were graphically superior but never quite the same for me though I enjoyed them. A definite ten out of ten... better still it used to wind my miseryguts Dad up... he'd see me playing it and groan "oh no... not this one again!" It bored him stuff watching me play this.[CR][B]Underfly, 13/01/2012[/B][CR]This was a complete non-linear classic, there were no limits, you have an entire planet to explore, but only 1 city, but you never know what you might find in the wildness. You could Fly, Drive or walk, even explore secret underground complexs, and if thats not enough you can always explore the sky![CR][B]ArnaudL, 27/03/2009[/B][CR]So much places to visit... in a so small memory footprint... Amazing ![CR]One of my favorites games, with shadow of the beast (amiga),ElektraGlide and Silent Service (microprose).[CR][B]Dirty8, 30/12/2008[/B][CR]I went to the Birmingah User Group with the guys that programmed this game. They would turn up and show us every week, how much of the game they had done. Happy days.[CR][B]Two-Pi, 16/08/2006[/B][CR]What a great game! I spent HOURS with this thing. [CR]Try skydiving: Get the CHEESE, fly up to the space station. Get out. Take cheese, jump off. Wheeeeeee!</plot>

		<plot>[B]Randy, 29/01/2011[/B][CR]This game is hard as hell and I never cease to be frustrated by it, particularly since I have yet to get past the 3rd or 4th level.[CR]However, it's a brilliant game and truly so much fun to play. Keeps me coming back for more. And it really was breathtaking at the time it came out. Had never seen anything like it for home consoles.[CR]Great memories![CR][B]Paul W. Westphal, 21/01/2009[/B][CR]I remember spending my lawn-mowing money on the 2600 version. IT WAS UNPLAYABLE. Then I got it for the 800 xl, and WOO HOO! what a difference. I gave this a '9'. Great fun.[CR][B]Cody Wright, 19/01/2009[/B][CR]Me and my brother when we were kids played this game and we always found a way to kill the miner in a funny way. Everytime we did, my brother would tickle me when we was dying. This was probably my all-time favorite Atari game as a kid!!!!! I give it a 9-10[CR][B]Scott Wozniak, 15/09/2008[/B][CR]Man, this game was brutal. I think it took me a solid week to beat it. Sadistic level design, but always fun. Don't bother with the sequel, Bounty Bob Strikes Back. It's about 10 times tougher and nowhere near as fun, in my opinion. Miner 2049er is a classic platformer programmed with great quality. 9 out of 10 score from me.[CR][B]Cem Dipçin, 08/02/2008[/B][CR]This is the game that I used to play all night long without any clause of fatigue but of course my mom's insistence on my sleep time.

My sister loved to play also even though she could barely get anywhere. I think I spent days trying to figure out how the elevators worked (had the cart and no manual.) One of my earliest big "DUH" moments. I beat it a couple times but it takes practice and a good joystick. [CR]I remember making up a song as a kid: "Radioactive Waste" for the giant pool of it in this game. Later in life I realized I had unintentionally parodied "When Doves Cry". Or maybe it was just a coincidence?[CR][B]thesayler, 25/01/2007[/B][CR]I remember playing extensively in the 80's--I had gotten to the point where I could play a LONG time, and would arrive at a level (cannot remember now, but it was the 3rd or 4th time through all levels) where it was absolutely impossible to do the maneuver needed to continue. I wrote the company but they never were able to give me any answer. Anyone else encounter this?</plot>

		<plot>[B]Daniel Thomas MacInnes, 16/10/2012[/B][CR]For any kid with a Missile Command cartridge for their Atari 2600, the 800 version was dazzling! It was also a lot harder and more tense, thanks to the breakaway missiles and airplanes. Graphics were terrific, very close to the arcade. If you played Atari back then, you definitely played Missile Command.[CR][B]Neekees, 20/07/2012[/B][CR]I play this a lot more now than I did when I was a kid. Great control, pace, and atmosphere, and so easy to jump right in. [CR][B]unk, 17/07/2012[/B][CR]this is simple but fun[CR][B]Boman, 12/09/2010[/B][CR]Many reviewers around the web don't like this conversion.[CR]In my opinion its not bad at all.[CR]Ok you might only have one firing base, but[CR]the graphics are almost arcade perfect and so is the sound.[CR]If only they would have given us a keyboard option to fire from three bases, like the original arcade game (which I own ;D) it would have been perfect.[CR][B]eppy2000, 15/08/2008[/B][CR]This was one of those terrific home conversions that made me really want an Atari 800 back in 1981. I enjoyed the 2600 version quite a bit, and felt it was a fairly respectable adaptation of the arcade game. But the day I saw it on an Atari 400 at an electronics store, I was just blown away. It looked like an almost exact duplicate of the arcade game. For me, this game has plenty of replay value, mostly to see if I beat my last (or best) score, or to see how many levels I can go.[CR][B]Starbug, 13/08/2008[/B][CR]Just as good as I remember it. Fast and furious. Lots of fun, though I would recommend using a jotstick/joypad rather than a keyboard. [CR]10 out of 10![CR][B]Muffy St. Bernard, 20/09/2007[/B][CR]Good even with an emulator keyboard! I'd rather a track TrakBall, but this game always kicks my butt anyway.[CR][B]ataridog, 19/09/2007[/B][CR]when you use the track ball this is a great game!! very fast gameplay with more than acceptable graphics (not like the arcade had steller graphics anyway). i always wanted to use the middle base in the arcade and when i saw this version for the A8 i knew it was going to rock!![CR][B]Nick Di-Perna, 06/12/2005[/B][CR]I’ve read some bad reviews about this little gem. Many rate it on it’s accuracy to it’s arcade counterpart. I actually PREFER this to the arcade game. Me and this kids have been coming back to it for a quick blast for years. Atari were right to build it into the XE game system. Supreme playability - isn’t that what really counts? 9/10. [CR][B]Kr0tki, 12/05/2005[/B][CR]You can control the game using the Atari TrakBall connected to joystick port 1. The combination Control+T activates/disactivates TrakBall control mode.[CR][B]j, 26/12/2004[/B][CR]Use OS-B. This allows you to skip levels at the title screen by pressing a corresponding #. For example: After loading the game, press 6. When the game is started, you will be on level 6. This feature does not work in XL/XE mode. </plot>

		<plot>[B]Paul Westphal, 29/10/2008[/B][CR]Play this one on halloween, and enjoy the scary music![CR][B]Robert, 05/07/2008[/B][CR]A simple but very enjoyable game. The Dutch Aackosoft tape release unfortunately doesn't have the music :-([CR][B]paul westphal, 06/06/2007[/B][CR]This has some of the most memorable music on the Atari. The games fun too.[CR][B]Jim Kuchera, 28/01/2007[/B][CR]You know this is going to be a good game from the opening title music. Next to M.U.L.E. and Preppie!, this opening theme is the best thing going musically. The game is only a little less so compelling. Basic premise: you're in a graveyard with monsters coming at ya that you have to smash with tombstones. Sounds gorey, but it's not. Just plain fun that never stops. The one complaint is that all monsters come from the upper left, and move toward the lower right. And that makes it predictable. But it's fun with a capital 'F'. So go have fun, and smash a few monsters!</plot>

[CR][B]Cubretti, 05/09/2010[/B][CR]I played this game in 1987[CR][B]Dima, 08/10/2009[/B][CR]I played this game on Atari.

In that time this game was so impressive for me, because I saw dreams about colour keys and rolled skulls..[CR]I love Monty so much.[CR]Thanx for nostalgy pictures and descriptions![CR][B]Scott Wozniak, 15/09/2008[/B][CR]Awesome feat of programming on this game. I loved it but man, it was tough as nails. One of the few games I never conquered. 9/10.[CR][B]MAXTHUNDER99, 05/06/2008[/B][CR]This game is one of my childhood favorites and I always liked going over to play it or even watch it being played at my friend's place. 10 on every version from the 2600 to the Sega Master System.[CR][B]eppy2000, 27/03/2008[/B][CR]Jaeger epitomized the talent of the young guns back in the day. I got many hours of play from this. It was quite an impressive feat compared to a lot of the other products out there -- and from someone who didn't have the same formal training of other programmers! I always preferred Jaeger's original work-in-progress over the watered down version put out by Parker Bros. While the latter was winnable and you had Pedro replaced with an Indiana Jones-type character, it wasn't as challenging and the sound and music was also compromised to make it all fit on the proverbial 16K cartridge.[CR][B]Brygadier, 05/01/2008[/B][CR]This game was absolutely brilliant.[CR][B]odi, 16/09/2007[/B][CR]game - legend[CR][B]Neo-Rio, 13/06/2007[/B][CR]I played the Commodore 64 version all the way up to and completing level 9. At level 9, the whole pyramid is pitch black - but if you ever get there, you'll know the layout like the back of your hand anyway.[CR]Should you finish level 9, you start another pyramid on level 9. Quite an anti-climax.[CR][B]Paul Westphal, 24/04/2007[/B][CR]This is one of the best platformers for us Atarians.This is the pinnacle of platforming/exploration on the old 8-bitters. Give it a shot, but have some patience with some of the timing-related issues that the game incorpoates. rating: 9.5 (no one is perfect)[CR][B]Cinka, 03/05/2006[/B][CR]The greatest game I have ever played. event after 15 years I play it wit great passion.[CR][B]Nixon, 16/04/2006[/B][CR]this game was always hard as ****...and after all it is still challenging after all this time...i m still curious what the end of it would be like..since the skill-level never allowed me to get there yet :D [CR][B]Subj, 27/02/2005[/B][CR]This particular version is indeed finished and winnable[CR][B]Matt Walsh, 29/03/2004[/B][CR]I don't believe this version is finished nor winnable. There is a strange room with a huge man in it that stomps, and when he does you die unless (maybe) you jump at the right time. I could never get past him. Somehow I always imagined that if I could finish the game, it would complete the 'cucaracha' (sp?) theme you heard the first notes of each time you picked something up.</plot>

They were creepy as hell. Two, once you figure out how to steal the crown and escape, the game stops being fun. At least, that was my experience. It felt too short and repetitive to keep me engaged. 6/10.[CR][B]Muffy St. Bernard, 19/12/2009[/B][CR]This truly is a fun adventure game! The music is great, the control and animation are perfect, and the quest itself has a lot of variety.

		<plot>[B]Muffy St. Bernard, 15/11/2009[/B][CR]I'm with Paul...this is pretty good! The controls are extremely responsive and the rules are straightforward (once you figure them out).[CR]But what it REALLY needs is a "suicide" key for those very common situations when you've trapped yourself. Or is this supposed to convey to us the slow-dying ennui of a mouse in a trap?[CR][B]Paul westphal, 13/11/2009[/B][CR]This is actually kinda fun after you figure out what you can and cannot get away with. The music is not bad but get's on your nerves after a while. The mouse 'death sound' is one of the most annoying you will ever hear in a video game. Fun for a while.</plot>

The graphics and sounds are very good for the old 8-bitter. My only complaint is that when the action heats up and you need to make a quick move, the character 'Jerks' me arround when I need to turn fast. One of the best games I have for the 8-bit. In all my games for the atari, I do come to it often. Also try 'Pengo'.[CR][B]Allen B, 12/10/2007[/B][CR]Impressive in every way (gameplay, graphics, sound), and extremely faithful to the Arcade version. It is just as good as the conversion on SNES, even a bit more challenging, which says alot for the 8-bit Atari. A must-have.</plot>

Some of the best graphics and color on the system, always entertaining, and the level editor alone kept me glued to the monitor for years. This is another one of those games you could bring back almost untouched. A perfect 10![CR][B]FastRobPlus, 31/03/2009[/B][CR]Pretty sure I will be buying an iPhone verison soon![CR][B]Gwobby, 28/03/2009[/B][CR]Hi Ron, thanks for creating such wonderful games.

Thanks for keeping it alive!!![CR]Ron Rosen[CR][B]kris, 23/08/2008[/B][CR]At first glance, just a standard run'n jump game, but actually one of the best ever for the 800. Items were positioned in just such a way to allow the levels to be completed - kind of like an "Incredible Machine" well ahead of its time. The construction set was awesome too - all of my creations involved hundreds of trampolines! Fantastic game![CR][B]Liz Still, 19/08/2008[/B][CR]I absolutly loved this game - do you know where I can get a copy of this game. I still have my old Atari 800XL and the Disk Drive 1080 and would love to get the floppy disk of this - I have been looking for this for years and havent managed to locate one - any help would be much appreciated :o)[CR]Thanks[CR]Liz[CR][B]Tibby, 01/12/2006[/B][CR]I remember this game from my "younger days" and I have to say that this was one of my ABSOLUTE FAVORITES!

		<plot>[B]gwobby, 05/10/2013[/B][CR]Nice review Baz. NYC is a fun game, you always feel you should be able to do better than you did![CR]www.gwobby.webs.com[CR][B]Baz, 01/10/2013[/B][CR]Despite a mixed review in Atari User pointing out it's creaky almost ancient graphics, this sounded appealing to me so bought it. Didn't regret it since it was fun being free to drive around as one liked for the fun of it. Yes, an early element of GTA there I guess and that was part of it's appeal being able to play a variety of challenges which unfortunately I recall got ever faster as the day wore on. Another one I almost completed but got killed in the very last building... grrr![CR]Looks terribly crude now but that was part of the fun back then using one's imagination and believing one was visiting these famous buildings. Of course now we have GTA with it's incredible details and free exploration with massive worlds to explore but in some ways this was the first taster of such a game where one could go about and have a lark for a while.[CR][B]Auntie Pastie, 05/12/2012[/B][CR]@Krm_Mayadagli; NYC *was* definitely PAL-compatible... or at least my UK copy was ("Americana" label release). Pretty safe bet that the German Ariolasoft release was the same (they used PAL too).[CR]You're right that it was available on tape; my "Americana" copy is the tape version.[CR][B]Krm_Mayadagli, 04/12/2012[/B][CR]***NTSC only![CR]No PAL also...[CR]***Was this game ever released on tape? [CR]Yes. Quite Sure[CR]Long Live...[CR][B]Auntie Pastie, 16/03/2011[/B][CR]Il Bastardo already nailed at least two points I would have made; the fact that this game is more than the sum of its mini-game parts, and the comparison with GTA (except here it was the police that seemingly persecuted you, via the notorious pink patrol car!)[CR]BTW, for a surprise, at the start of the game, remain outside the city until your gas runs out (this will take a while!) You can now walk back the way you came and come across a weird jumbled mixture of roads, water and cars!!! (Don't enter the "real" city though or you become trapped within its limits as happens normally).[CR][B]Il bastardo, 10/04/2008[/B][CR]As a pure collection of arcade games, NYC would provide decent playing value already. But luckily, this game is more than merely the sum of its parts: The many little arcade games are embedded into a very dynamic and amusing traffic simulation, which combines the numerous, fairly challenging tasks to a very satisfying whole. Though the "meal times" tend to get annoying quickly, and the controls react rather fidgety at times, this is a title worth checking out. GTA in its fledgling stages... *g (8/10)[CR][B]Cem Dipçin, 08/02/2008[/B][CR]I remember spending a big amount of time with this cute arcade when I was 6. This is totally fun. I was just cruising around with the car without even trying to complete any tasks. [CR]Remembering old days...[CR][B]Jonny EOL, 11/11/2006[/B][CR]A collection of little arcade games threaded together on a (rather blocky) rendition of NYC - still a lot of fun, though. [CR][B]Tomas, 20/04/2006[/B][CR]Randy: Yeah... I have a nice memories too.... :-)[CR][B]Randy Johnson, 10/08/2005[/B][CR]I remember spending more time driving crazily through traffic than completing the tasks. There was something satisfying about the way the other cars crunched into one another. A good little game!</plot>

		<plot>[B]vacuumnoise, 27/05/2011[/B][CR]awesome, amazing graphics, very inventive; great contrast of industrial sound and cutesy music! -VNR Press[CR][B]Greg B., 07/03/2011[/B][CR]Well, this looks more like an awful "Shamus" to me than anything else.[CR]I guess Atari didn't want to put their name on a game that had a toilet seat for an enemy, perhaps?[CR][B]Thorsten Günther, 03/12/2009[/B][CR]Hello! I've just read that this game was indeed sold to Atari Germany, but never published ("ST Computer" issue 6/2001). Is is true that not a single legitimate copy of this game ever existed?[CR][B]Andreas, 24/03/2009[/B][CR]The plot was the following: Nadral, the little flying 'helicopter bird' has to rescue his (similar looking) friend who is hidden behind some doors in the labyrinth. In order to open the doors, you have to find the keys distributed in the labyrinth. When you have opened all doors in a level, you can go to the room with the friend and voila, you can touch him and enter the next level... In the upper levels, the map of the labyrinth is quite complicated :-)[CR][B]ElB, 03/10/2008[/B][CR]This is one *sinister* game; the title screen has a deceptively jolly bit of ragtime music, but when you start the game a terrifying harsh German voice yells at you, and you're thrown into an inexplicable nightmarish world. Everything's out to get you, time is constantly running out (and an ominous throbbing noise of ever-increasing tempo doesn't let you forget this for a moment), and while the game hard and unforgiving it's not difficult to the point of being frustrating, and the strange visuals and creepy sounds really add atmosphere. Even now I find my heart rate shoots through the roof when I play it![CR](Anyone know what the plot was supposed to be?)</plot>

I I remember playing this for hours with a friend as it was amongst the very first Atari 8-bit games we owned. It took ages to load from cassette but was well worth the wait.</plot>

		<plot>[B]Gwobby, 12/12/2012[/B][CR]Necromancer is an awesome game (and now playing in the High Score Club - link on http://gwobby.webs.com/ [CR]Almost eveyone will find Necromancer too hard and not be able to figure things out so it's a game where you really do need to READ THE INSTRUCTIONS!! [CR]OK Here is a quick summary:[CR]SCREEN 1 - Plant seeds, guard them, last out till the end. The more trees you end up with the higher the bonuses:[CR]&gt;Level 1 1-4 Trees @ 100pts[CR]&gt;Level 2 5-9 Trees @ 300pts[CR]&gt;Level 3 10-14 Trees @ 500pts[CR]&gt;Level 4 15-19 Trees @ 700pts[CR]&gt;Level 5 20+ Trees @ 900pts[CR]SCREEN 2 - HOLD fire to move yourself. RELEASE fire to; stand still / move the wand to kill spiders / pick up a tree move it over the holes and press fire to plant it. You must crush the eggs using the trees and then *IMPORTANT: STORE THE TREES BACK IN THE TREE BIN BEFORE GOING DOWN TO THE NEXT DEPTH!* 5 depths 'levels' each with 2 rows of seeds. There is a big bonus for trees remaining when you've completed this![CR]SCREEN 3 - The Graveyard's difficulty is increased by any eggs you left behind and spiders you left roaming on SCREEN 2! Tread on all the gravestones to complete each round.[CR]Zombie Spiders and The Salvating Spider from Sith eh?!!![CR]Have fun[CR][B]Hillsy_, 29/10/2011[/B][CR]Possibly the best Atari 400/800/XL game. Definitely in the Top 5 games. I actually managed to complete this game, and even now I can remember the end sequence. Haunting music, excellent graveyard fight, throwing disc like tron, building trees and trying not to get poison on them. Then later to be greeted with dancing trees...this game had it all. A classic! 9/10[CR][B]jcat, 26/04/2011[/B][CR]Simply put: This was THEE greatest release on the Atari 8-bit series. The difficulty is way high so if your hand/eye coordination is not up to par - stay clear. Very addictive, excellent music - and a technical tour de force. Bill Williams was my idol back then. Rest in peace, Bill.[CR][B]Wesley Connally, 19/01/2008[/B][CR]This game is magical. The music is captivating. The trees sparkle like magic. The plot is cool. I was ecstatic to find it had later been released on cartridge, so I recently bought it.[CR][B]eppy2000, 09/10/2007[/B][CR]A very magical, dreamlike game that holds up better than most games of today. For a 1982 game, it was ahead in many ways at a time when most companies were making 8-bit games that looked like they were written for the 2600 instead. I also strongly dispute the earlier poster's claim of Williams being under the influence of anything other than having a very strong imagination. Perhaps he's confusing him with someone else?[CR][B]JSUK, 27/09/2007[/B][CR]The irony is, Bill taking theology took him closer to heaven in a literal sense - he moved to a city for the course, and the air made his lungs worse.[CR][B]Chris M Barlow, 22/08/2007[/B][CR]This is the most underrated 8-bit game ever made. Everything about it is 10/10.[CR]Once you've mastered the control then it is a delight and pleasure to play. If you can complete the final level you are rewarded with a burst of rainbow colours and the satisfaction of finishing the game, however this game is all about high scores and you just have to play it again. A true original arcade treasure.[CR][B]J. Maynard Gelinas, 01/02/2007[/B][CR]No. There's no indication that Mr. Williams had a drug/alcohol problem at any point in his life. The Wikipedia entry for him does say that he had Cystic Fibrosis and that he decided to give up programming to earn a Masters Degree in Theology. Then, sadly, he died of his illness. [CR]I remember playing this game as a kid and loved it back then. Great stuff. [CR][B]Avram, 13/01/2007[/B][CR]Typical of Bill William's work, this is a classic (albeit a little difficult). Shows the same originality as his other essential game, Alley Cat.[CR][B]Nick Di-Perna, 06/12/2005[/B][CR]I don’t approve of games getting better ratings due to questionable mental state of the programmer/s involved - Ninja Golf springs to mind. I will make the exception with this one. I don’t know if its creator was on anything but he was certainly evil! A truly bizarre and highly original concept which requires immense skill to master. It’s a mix of Eugene Jarvis and Jeff Minter with trees instead of Llamas. I would recommend using an arcade stick to get the most out of this game but an Atari 7800 Euro pad with thumb attachment is working just fine for me. An underrated classic 9/10.</plot>

		<plot>[B]http://gwobby.webs.com/, 20/06/2010[/B][CR]Possibly the best pinball for the Atari! still fun especially multi-player, almost made me think about sticking a set of paddles to the dining table and sawing two legs off it :-D[CR][B]Jim Kuchera, 16/12/2006[/B][CR]This was an odd game, but I bought it because I love pinball, and there were no other titles available for the Atari 800 at the time. The sound effects were delivered through the small speaker in the 800. I have no idea why the Pokey chip was not used. Ball action was bizarre and unnatural, but extremely fast. The playfield was very original with lots and lots of bumpers, spinners, ball locks, etc. I was so very pleased when David's Midnight Magic was released. It was clearly superior with great arcade ball action, sound effects, and other surprises. Simple playfield did not distract.</plot>

		<plot>[B]Gwobby, 27/11/2010[/B][CR]This is a nice little game, press start then enter 1-9 for the difficulty. Not too many screens, so it's an arcade adventure where you can remember where you have been. To complete each level walk about collect keys and treasures, then return to the front door and pull down. Pressing file drains your life but may open some areas where you don't have a key? (I didn't use this much.) Nice relaxing game and fun too.</plot>

		<plot>[B]Michael Gregor, 08/12/2012[/B][CR]I hung out with Peter when he was coding this game back in 1982 / 83. It was crazy to think that this self taught 18 year old kid was writing games out of a Las Vegas computer shop. There was an arcade next door and we did play countless games of Zaxxon. Peter squeezed every bit out of of the Atari 800 to give the best of what graphics and sound were capable of back then. Airbrush was hot back then too... :-)[CR][B]Daniel Thomas MacInnes, 10/05/2011[/B][CR]C'mon, you can't deny the fun of shooting up buildings. A poor man's Zaxxon or Blue Max? Yes. Did I ever care? Not really. I played this game much more than I ever should have, but it was good fun and provides lots of mindless violence and destruction. God Bless America! Let's give this a generous 7/10.</plot>

I played it a lot. Tip: Each time you enter a room, the daggers/stars that are not held by someone are repositioned. So by entering and leaving the room several times, you can easily pick them up and destroy enemies from a distance making the game not that difficult.[CR][B]Lockett, 28/05/2008[/B][CR]Downloading a .zip file is no different from downloading any other file.

Good music and graphics, slightly limited gameplay, still excellent fun![CR][B]Anna Tariuser, 29/05/2007[/B][CR]Pretty good game for the money with nice graphics. The fighting was fairly simple (kick thugs, kick karatekas more, avoid direct contact with evil Ninjas... I never used my sword!).[CR]Main drawback was that once you'd completed it, it was fairly easy to do it over and over again. If I remember correctly, I used to be able to do the whole game in four or five minutes flat- collect all the idols, kick the baddies to pieces, "rescue the princess" (you never saw her) and return to the starting location.[CR][B]Paul, 10/04/2006[/B][CR]First game I ever got around to completing - used to get up early to get 30 mins in before the old paper round - great times![CR][B]Avram Dumitrescu, 23/10/2005[/B][CR]Steve Coleman wrote some games I loved on the Atari - Pharoah's Curse, Rainbow Walker and this, Ninja. It's got pretty graphics, good tunes but slightly repetitive gameplay and limited moves. Still, as a budget release this is a fun game.</plot>

		<plot>[B]eppy2000, 22/03/2008[/B][CR]While I think it'd be cool to be a ninja, this game actually makes me reconsider! It's not much of an action game as it is more "sports" oriented. You either deflect objects thrown at you (requiring VERY good timing) or busting up stuff. The latter requires the proverbial, frenetic back-and-forth joystick movement to gain enough power -- and within a time limit, to boot -- to break said objects.[CR]The one frustrating thing about the game is that there is no margin for error. So most of the time you find yourself with low scores and not qualifying to get to the next round. At least you don't get those problems playing under an emulator. :)</plot>

		<plot>[B]Philsan, 03/03/2011[/B][CR]At the time I didn't know this game. A real masterpiece! 10/10[CR][B]marquisor, 25/08/2010[/B][CR]Great addictive game! A bit wonderous why not dying all time, but keeps the fun high! Because even without dying it's challenging. 8/10[CR][B]progrocker69, 15/05/2009[/B][CR]This game is an almost perfect clone of the arcade game "Anteater", published in 1982 by Stern. Instead of an anteater using his long tongue to eat ants and worms out of the ground while clearing a maze of dots as in "Anteater", in this game you are apparently cleaning out underground oil pipelines of dots while avoiding mechanical enemies.[CR]There is a huge variety of mazes to complete and the difficulty ramps up somewhat while managing not to become unmanageable to anyone with a measure of old school arcade skill. I consider this to be one of the best games ever made for the Atari XL and I recommend it to anyone!</plot>

I recall reading in reviews that Eric Hammond watched many hours of videos in order to get the characteristics of the players down pat in their computer game counterparts. He succeeds for the most part. Dr. J has better stamina, for instance, and Bird is great from shooting at the 3-point line. The graphics aren't that great (but no worse or better than on other platforms), the sound effects and animation could be a bit better. It's also a little on the sluggish side in that it doesn't have the intensity of a real NBA game.[CR][B]Tim Collier, 26/10/2007[/B][CR]I must have spent more time playing this game back in the late 80's than I did at my REAL job! This game proves that graphics aren't as important as the gameplay...it's a shame the game companies now haven't figured that out. Oh how I wish I could play it again, with my old Atari joystick late into the night...just one more game...ok, just one more...[CR][B]Tomas, 28/04/2006[/B][CR]Excellent, It was one of my favorite game...</plot>

		<plot>[B]Numfar, 29/01/2008[/B][CR]This version of Pacman is my all time favorite. The arcade version required me to memorize paterns to survive to the highest levels but this one I can play "freestyle" to a nice high score but still feel very challenged.[CR][B]Flypaper, 15/08/2007[/B][CR]While it was a relief to finally get a version of the grand daddy of all video games on the Atari home computers, this version turned out to be a somewhat lackluster translation. The play mechanics largely remained intact, yet the graphics and sound had largely been drained of their personality. Gone were the ghosts' expressive eyes, the amusing interludes, and the full-bodied sound effects that filled so many arcades. Not the best effort from Atari's stable of programmers, but satisfying nonetheless.[CR][B]Jim Kuchera, 16/12/2006[/B][CR]It's been said that the arcade version of Pacman is what brought women into the world of arcade games. It was true in my house when I brought this cart home and fired it up in my 8-bitter. My wife grabbed my Atari joystick (don't get smart), and she had so much fun with this game. The Atari translation of the arcade ROM is great. Smooth graphics, fine sound, a game that still sells on cell phones near the top of the d/l list. Isn't that amazing for a game that is 25 years old. Like wine, this vintage only gets better with age. All the sequels had cutesy variations (PacmanJr., MSPacman, SuperPacman), but could not improve on the original. Several fine also rans were On-Line's Jawbreaker which was sued off the market, and Mousekattack, a wonderful little game. What is it about maze games that keeps us coming back for more? But the cartridge. It's always for sale on eBay at bargain prices.[CR][B]Cesar, 19/10/2006[/B][CR]Are you thinking in vote less than 10???? are you stupid or something??? come on ITS PACMAN !!!!!!!!!!!!</plot>

		<plot>[B]http://gwobby.webs.com/, 22/06/2010[/B][CR]Excellent game, holds up well today, play on intermediate... concentrate on making the 3 ice blocks in a row for 10k bonus per screen, ignore the baddies until you have done this... use the blocks with sno-bees in them as shields... until they hatch.. don't try and kill the baddies if they are too close![CR][B]Paul W., 16/08/2007[/B][CR]Looks primitive does'nt it? Wait until you play this addictive puzzle game.You can either go for points or go for distance, which changes the dynamic of each level. Pretty good arcade translation for the 'ol 8-bit.The looping song might make YOU loopy though. Great fun! ( I got to level 23 on intermediate, how high can you go?):) </plot>

Sort of like the Bruce Lee game, which came out a year later and by a different company, taking place in the catacombs. And there's the luck of the draw when the bird drops you off at a screen you've already completed or one you haven't. This usually adds to the time it takes to complete the level.[CR][B]Brygadier, 05/01/2008[/B][CR]Ah, great memories...[CR][B]jeff wagner, 04/07/2006[/B][CR]incredible game, definitely one of the most involved games from the era..</plot>

		<plot>[B]sparkydav, 05/01/2013[/B][CR]My brother and I bought this on tape at a little Atari and Apple computer store when it first came out. Great graphics and very challenging! The whole concept just busted us both up, we had to buy it!! As usual, Synapse did not disappoint. 2 spatulas way up, but watch out for those pesky hornets!!! :O[CR][B]Kerem, 31/10/2009[/B][CR]ALso I lost it.[CR]in Marmara Earthquake.[CR]it was quite good for upgrading your reflex:)[CR][B]kris, 06/09/2008[/B][CR]Perhaps not quite on the top 10 list here, but I do have to admit that to this day, I think of this game whenever taking place in anything resembling a picnic.[CR][B]Jim Kuchera, 16/12/2006[/B][CR]Go get those bugs. This game will remind you of all those picnics when the bugs got you one way or another. It will remind you how stupid picnics really are (and dangerous too when the mayo or chicken salad gets too warm and you get e. coli!) I love this game, and my only criticism is that it gets too hard too fast. The game is one that will make you turn your 8-bitter off and start scratching because you'll think there's a tick climbing up your leg, or a cootie in your hair. Yuck! Have fun with this quarter-century old game. Loads of fun with a second or third grade child, and nonviolent except for the sound of the swatter. No blood, just disappearing bugs. This one's rare, almost impossible to find. Good luck![CR][B]gates, 29/11/2006[/B][CR]Great game, very addictive.</plot>

		<plot>[B]Benden, 12/02/2012[/B][CR]This game is a living legend for me. I've spent countless hours Pitfall 2. Very difficult and damn long game : I could never beat it. Even now, that I'm 41, I can still remember the game's music...[CR][B]jcat, 28/04/2011[/B][CR]I loved Activision back then, but I'm probably one of the few who didn't jump on board the Pitfall bandwagon. Great for its time no doubt, but I can think of about 100 other games that are superior. Case in point: Star Raiders - which should be higher than this on the top 100 Rating here at Atarimania. Oh to the gentlemen that mention usually C-64 version were better except for Pitfall? No way. When programmers took advantage of the Atari graphics, the C-64 looked AND played ill in comparison. I think the only two games that were better on the C-64, originated on that platform: Racing Destruction Set and Pogo Joe[CR][B]Lockett, 07/05/2009[/B][CR]Actually the Atari versions are usually better. Look at the Lucasfilm fractal games, the Alternate Reality games, Dropzone, M.U.L.E, Rainbow Walker, Attack of the Mutant Camels, the Donkey Kong conversion, etc. No comparison.[CR][B]KRIS H., 05/04/2009[/B][CR]There were only a few games in which I had to leave the power on overnight and this was one of them, due to the lack of a save game feature and overall length of the last level. [CR][B]Philsan, 17/01/2008[/B][CR]The Atari version of this beautiful game is better then C64's (often it is the contrary). In the Commodore machine the second part is missing.[CR][B]eppy2000, 14/01/2008[/B][CR]If there was a downside to the game is that it didn't use the same enhanced graphics as its predecessor. Many of Activision's games in the early '80s were more or less straight ports from the 2600 version. Meaning there were only marginal enhancements, as opposed to the ones found in later, original games with great sound and graphics. It's still a classic, however.[CR]The Adventurer's Edition segment of this game has got to be one of the most challenging exercises you'll face. I was never the type that had good timing and reflexes when it came to video games, so it was extremely challenging (and frustrating!) to complete this. The first half of the game would take me 20-30 minutes to complete, but the bigger part took me several hours! You have not only to be VERY quick in jumping, running, and dodging, but you have to memorize where all the various pieces are to complete it![CR][B]Palf, 14/12/2007[/B][CR]Seeing this game in an Atari shop made me sell upgrade from a spectrum to an atari 800![CR][B]kris, 28/09/2004[/B][CR]While the original Pitfall was lacking in overall objectives, this one turns out to be an adventure of epic size. The first level alone would make a challenge but that is only the start....</plot>

		<plot>[B]MrFish, 28/04/2014[/B][CR]One advantage over games like Pole Position is that you could actually bump into other cars without immediately bursting into a flaming ball of pixels. Pole Position was a much more realistic, believable, and colorful game, from the racing aspect though. Pitstop was a little too overhead, with not too great a control scheme, or maneuverability. The "Pitstop" part of the game was cool though, and added some depth.[CR][B]Jonny EOL, 24/04/2008[/B][CR]I can't remember another racing game having user-controllable pitstops until the very recent F1 sims. The game itself was otherwise quite ordinary - the usual 'you've got the fastest car and just have to dodge very slow cars' thing. </plot>

		<plot>[B]twh/f2, 06/03/2014[/B][CR]Not even a second one can feel the illusion of speed and action which is so essential for a racing game. It seems it makes no difference when driving 15 km/h or 280 km/h. The vehicles can not even move left or right without stuttering pixel by pixel.[CR] [CR]So sad..[CR][B]Daniel Thomas MacInnes, 08/05/2011[/B][CR]I enjoyed Pitstop II on Atari back in the day, but the C64 version just pounds it into the sand. That's really unfortunate, because there's no reason why the Atari 800 version couldn't have an equal port. But no doubt the focus was shifting to the C64 as Atari was melting down.[CR][B]Martijn Veken, 31/10/2004[/B][CR]I have this game on tape.

		<plot>[B]RiverRoyal, 25/01/2011[/B][CR]A real puzzler that kept me amused for a good time after I had finished it. I'd love to play this one more time...............[CR][B]Robert, 22/06/2008[/B][CR]This is one of the few games I played a lot. In fact I finished it a few times, trying to finish it faultless. For a budget game it was highly addictive. Highly recommended.[CR][B]Il bastardo, 10/11/2007[/B][CR]A cleverly designed little title, that deserved more attention indeed: The shooter-like controls merely are a facade for a well-balanced mixture of puzzle and arcade game, that requires both reflexes and brains. A large variety of nifty ingame-features (like the scrolling monitor) adds the dose of diversion to keep one hooked, until you get a clean shot at the cat. ;)[CR]The sounds could be better, though, and more levels also would've been favorable. Nevertheless, i consider "Power Down" a sadly overlooked gem, which more than deserves a test run.[CR][B]hippijo, 09/09/2007[/B][CR]this game is my favourite one!</plot>

		<plot>[B]http://gwobby.webs.com/, 17/09/2010[/B][CR]Nice frogger style game, not as fun as Frogger II:Threedeep but maybe the 2nd best frogger game for the Atari? Collect golf balls one at at time and take them back to the start. Gets faster on level 4 and becomes very challenging, one day I will beat level 8! Think there is some way of starting on the higher levels involving shift![CR][B]Preppie!!, 13/09/2010[/B][CR]My favorite game of all time, still play it today[CR]Genius[CR][B]Scott Wozniak, 15/09/2008[/B][CR]Man, I loved the box artwork on this one. It's that ROSS guy, who also did the cover for Miner 2049er. Fantastic game. Took the Frogger premise and actually bettered it. I'm so glad I found this website! 9/10.[CR][B]Jim Kuchera, 30/12/2006[/B][CR]I simply LOVE this game. It's a ton more fun than Frogger, but has the same game objective. The wonderful music will remain with you long after you turn off the old Atari, and the sound effects linger too. Infinitely playable, seldom needing the fire button, and lots of increasing strategy to win make this a first rate creation. My hats off to you Russ Wettmore. You're one heckuva programmer. If you find this game, buy it. You won't be disappointed.[CR][B]Brunoni, 29/07/2005[/B][CR]THANKS!!! I was looking for these pics... just for the memories[CR]Your website ROCKS!!</plot>

		<plot>[B]Flypaper, 15/08/2007[/B][CR]Q*bert has always been a delight to play. It's one of those unique games that successfully combines two or more genres. In this case, the puzzle, platform and action genres. So it's translation from Parker Brothers was applauded by the Atari commutiy. Yet it's another one of those ports that leaves a little to be desired. Like Pac-Man, it's characters like eyes or shading, and consequently personality. And to my reccolection, the arcade Q*bert was the first videogame character to swear. Unfortunately, that funny interlude is missing too. :( But Q*bert is still welcome on any system, including the Atari 8-bit. By all means, hop onboard!</plot>

		<plot>[B]Jim Kuchera, 22/12/2006[/B][CR]Legend has it that when Atari deep-sixed, that tens of thousands of carts were buried somewhere in a California desert never to be resurrected. Well, I'm glad not all the Qix carts found their way to such an unseemly end. Qix is a terrific game, constantly changing, blood pressure raising, hand sweating, eye bulging, and infuriating. What great fun for the hypertensive! How did they get that code in in an 8K cart? This is a nice coin-op translation that can be played in 30 seconds or 3 hours. Readily available on the Net, it must be in every Atari collectors cart box. Buy it NOW! </plot>

How did John Atack do THAT??? This is another great Synapse title that I personally never could conquer. You've got to be good at rhythm, much like Pitfall, which I'm not. I simply watched my sons whip through this one. I was good at throwing rocks at the Orcs though, so I didn't feel completely out of it. This game plays a lot like Synapse's 'Necromancer', but more humor here. Very cute graphic rendering. No other game is even similar to this, other than Necromancer, and the comparison is a loose one. This game is certainly worth owning. Add it to your collection. "The bells! The bells!</plot>

		<plot>[B]sparkydav, 03/01/2013[/B][CR]I loved this game! EA was always one of my favorite publishers, and this one was alot of fun. The controls were a bit tricky if I remember correctly, slight delay between your move and what actually happened on screen. Nice packaging as well, they put alot of effort into everything they published. : D[CR][B]Daniel Thomas MacInnes, 08/05/2011[/B][CR]I never even knew Racing Destruction Set appeared on the Atari 800. I loved it on the C64. Interesting that this is considered a weak port, which is very strange, given the spectacular EA games on the computer.[CR]Note the date of release - 1985. Aha, this would make sense. By this time, Atari had melted down, and Warner Bros sold the consumer division to Jack Tramiel. The Tramiels were notorious for their heavy-handed treatment of partners and software developers. It was also well known that Atari Corp's focus would be the ST, as Tramiel was obsessed with revenge against Commodore.[CR]I'm sure these were factors. We should also consider bad feelings against Tramiel for launching a disastrous price war that devestated the home computer market. I could see developers embracing Commodore after his departure and shunning Atari Corp as a bit of revenge.[CR][B]Greg B., 01/05/2011[/B][CR]eppy2000: EXACTLY! Well said.[CR]I always had the feeling that there was a bit of industry-wide sabotage against Atari ports by '84-'85. Look at EA's first few Atari titles...and then look at stuff like this. Yeah, the whole industry basically tried to sink the Atari 8-bit in favor of the C-64 by releasing crap ports. This one is a little obvious though...it's terrible.[CR][B]eppy2000, 30/09/2007[/B][CR]Trip Hawkins was the head of E.A. back then. In his letter to Antic, he said the Atari 800 was one of his favorite computers. Judging by the quality of some of the conversions, you wonder how much he really liked the Atari. I found some of their Atari versions lacking because it seemed like no one knew how to utilize the sound and graphics to full potential.[CR]I remember when Antic had us do that letter writing campaign to get companies to release their software for the 8-bit line. It was for the most part, a lost cause! Some companies, like Broderbund, did come through with gems like Print Shop and Karateka. But other companies couldn't care less.[CR][B]Andrew Bernstein, 13/09/2006[/B][CR]Compared to the legendary C64 version, this was a major letdown at the time (non-PC term="half assed effort"). I still remember the letter of the CEO of Electronic Arts published in Antic (1985) asking ATARI users to support their releases so that more would be coming ! How do you want customers to buy your product if this one is not even good in the first place ?</plot>

		<plot>[B]John, 08/05/2010[/B][CR]I love this game primarily for its atmosphere, literally being "somewhere over the rainbow" and watching the night turn to day and back.[CR][B]Lockett, 30/05/2008[/B][CR]This game is far beyond Q*Bert in every way. The 3D graphics are much more convincing, the sounds are great and suit their purposes, and the game itself is nicely challenging. Rainbow Walker also has changed mechanics from Q*Bert's - for example, the enemies now can de-color squares, but can also be killed by the player, if the player either freezes and steps on them or scrolls the screen, pushing them off. There are also bonus rounds at the ends of the levels that require the player to stay on a moving platform - this section is vaguely reminiscent of Dance Dance Revolution in its execution. If I had to play a game that involved stepping on squares, I'd take this over Q*Bert any day.[CR][B]Yungstar 06, 09/01/2008[/B][CR]a great Q*Bert style game that stands the test of time and is very playable on a handheld games system like the GP32.[CR][B]Jim Kuchera, 13/12/2006[/B][CR]So many rainbows, so little time---to make a decision. If you want to play a real palm-sweater, this is it! With a wonderful play premise, great music and sound effects, and delightful cartoon graphics, this is one I would return to evening after evening following a challenging day at work. I found work to be easier than Rainbow Walker, but not as much fun. I like the fact that you start with more than the standard three 'lives'. Believe me, you'll need more than three. A very very playable piece of software, and the author deserves a place in the Software Hall of Fame (if there were one). Buy this one![CR][B]martin, 05/02/2006[/B][CR]This is Q*Bert in the sky with Z-axis scrolling, has the most exciting bonus round where you have to jump onto the appearing squares for money, a quality game.</plot>

		<plot>[B]Cats McGanny, 15/02/2011[/B][CR]Isn't this basically 'Auto Racing' on the Intellivision?[CR][B]alex, 13/02/2011[/B][CR]One of the best piece of SW I've seen on the Atari 800XL. From the game itself, to the circuit editor and the menus.[CR][B]kris, 28/09/2004[/B][CR]One of the best racing games of all-time. The concentration needed to navigate a fast lap time in this game is what makes this game so challenging. The overhead view requires you to learn proper racing lines more than other "in-car view" racing games of the era. The two-player option makes for fantastic racing and passing, unparalleled to this day in my opinion. The construction-set only makes this true classic even better.-</plot>

		<plot>[B]Michael Smithson, 19/07/2009[/B][CR]The graphics were the best :-) I had only 8 colours to choose from. It was a fantastic game for it's time. Credit goes to Anthony and Russell for there great work.[CR][B]Jim Kuchera, 03/12/2008[/B][CR]The first time I saw this with my sons in a local arcade, I was hooked. Many quarters clinked into the slot. And then we waited, and waited, and waited some more until a home port was available for the Atari. To our surprise, it wasn't good, IT WAS GREAT!!! It had all of the goodies from the dedicated arcade game including the humor of the little naked guy shivering and sulking off the screen in embarrassment. I booted it tonight again for the first time in years, and enjoyed it all over again. Demolishing buildings as a monster was never so much fun in any other venue. This goes to the top of my 'A' list! Kudos to you Mr. Wilson for a remarkable job![CR][B]Andrew Bernstein, 18/09/2006[/B][CR]While not in the same category as the disastrous Atari 8Bit conversion of Racing Destruction Set, this adaptation of Rampage definitely lacks some polish (this sometimes feels like a slighty improved port of the Spectrum release... No Kidding !). However, so few games were released by Activision in the second half of the eighties (Shangai, Starblade), we still should feel lucky this one does exist. Now, it's time for either a hack or an improved version.[CR][B]Anthony Wilson, 15/05/2006[/B][CR]I bloody well wrote this game, probably the pinnacle of my gaming coding career, ah those where the days!!!!!</plot>

		<plot>[B]thax, 21/10/2013[/B][CR]Fantastic comments! when i played this game i always chose higher levels of play for more mountain top aliens to destroy, similar to what all have said, the fear factor in this game is just amazing, i used to travel round quite fast shooting the heck out of all things green, goose pimples from head top to toe nails and mass personal vocal prettyness from ones self, emrgency landings ,green dude anihalations, all just super exciting. used to annoy me when u landed to rescue a pilot, and a green freak on a mountain top keeps firing at you depleting your energy.....hurry up pilot! one of the best games ever. this is why my c64 collection went to the charity shop!![CR][B]Thomas, 10/12/2010[/B][CR]Yeah, I've remember that time,,, I was terribly sick... But on the other side it was really good to take holidays (yeah my mom took me tea and food for whole day) from school cos it's just make me try games from my Tape Cartridges what I've got with my father upgraded atari 800XE casette recorder (It was amazing when he bring it one time with yellow cord around the main on the casette recorder and said hey kids now me and my friend boost it like never ever :) Yea, we are in 21 century, but I am still playing this old games cos nothing else never exchange that feeling... and this game is shiny example of the brilliant ideas which changed me from boy to man :D yeah that alien could sent me to the wood sleeping bag I suppose.... But I've survived :) And for second time I've strong feeeeling I will go to Fractalus again......[CR][B]Nostromo, 22/10/2010[/B][CR]I loved this game it was sooo ahead of everything else! Iv always looked for a remake with no luck...[CR]BUT today! [CR]http://www.lsdwa.com/projects/fractalus/[CR]Oh what a joy!!!!!!!!![CR][B]Gonzo, 16/01/2010[/B][CR]The best game ever. I can't forget the moment when the alien popped-up!. It was one of the scariest moment of my Childhood.[CR][B]Macc, 18/08/2009[/B][CR]Add me to the fill-your-trousers brigade when the alien popped up. Will never forget it. The greatest game of my youth![CR][B]Lockett, 28/05/2008[/B][CR]I've played every version of this game, and none can touch the Atari original. Everything about it is perfect - the smooth motion, the limited pop-up, the intro, the varied sound effects, the colors, the atmosphere and suspense - everything. In my opinion, it's the best of the Lucasfilm fractal games.[CR]That said, it would be great to have a remake of it.[CR][B]Yungstar 06, 09/01/2008[/B][CR]what can be said.... amazing, a classic.[CR]a remake/update please....[CR][B]Muffy St. Bernard, 14/10/2007[/B][CR]I used to play "Behind Jaggi Lines" an awful lot -- dark room, volume turned up, that long pause before the pilot (?) starts knocking on the door -- but this is the first time I've really played the REAL version. Differences: pilots are scarcer, some pilots are "Aces" (what's that all about?), pilots left outside too long begin to knock slower, nice warning when you're in range of a pilot, the dot on the long range scanner is much bigger, and it seems to me that you don't actually SEE the pilots as much as you do in Jaggi Lines. The music is different (dramatic notes are held instead of repeated) and, of course, the intro.[CR][B]eppy2000, 07/10/2007[/B][CR]Awesome game, ahead of its time! There was also a great interview with the programmers in a 1985 issue of Computer Games magazine. They discussed the genesis of this (and Ballblazer) and George Lucas's involvement. This was the first game to utilize fractal technology for home computer. [CR] Alas, like so many Atari 8-bit breakthroughs, the news never went mainstream. Everything about the game is top notch: the gameplay, the graphics/animation, the sound effects, and the John Williams-like theme. And yes, I'm another hapless victim of the Jaggi ending my game. I knew there would be aliens in this game, but I didn't know what to expect. I had landed in a spot where the pilot wasn't visible, so I waited for the knocking sound. Instead, the thing jumped in front of the windshield. Because I had my sound on fairly loud (hooked to a boombox), I nearly got a heart attack. I was so stunned I was unable to hit the engines quickly to kill it. It took a few minutes for my body to settle down. :)[CR][B]steve, 10/08/2007[/B][CR]Fantastic game. Realistic 3d environment great graphics and sound. The atmosphere and 'tension' created in this game was a first, im sure, in home computer games. I will never forget playing this with my friends, with the heart stopping anticipation of deciding whether the humanoid is an alien or not. Fantastic![CR]Spectrum and amstrad could never deliver this heightened experience, it really proved what the atari 800 could do in the right hands. Classic.[CR][B]Heaven/Taquart, 09/02/2007[/B][CR]- great gfx[CR]- great 3d gameplay[CR]- great love for details[CR]- great "battle star galactica"-like starting sequenze[CR]- great sound engine while starting[CR]- great title tune[CR]- great great great[CR]... ps... as many players first time i have seen jaggie i was falling off my seat as i played at night...boy i was suprised...[CR][B]Pengwin, 09/02/2007[/B][CR]This was one of my favourite games back in the 80's, and still is today. I believe this and Ballblazer were the first games from Lucasfilm Games. A fantastic debut.[CR][B]Andrew Bernstein, 26/09/2006[/B][CR]The 1987 cartridge version represented my first exposure to Rescue On Fractalus and I couldn't have been better surprised. From the groundbreaking fractal graphics, the real time approach (day and night are represented in this simulation), the fast decision making needed (do you fry this pilot ? Is he an Alien ?) to many other aspects of the gameplay make of Rescue Of Fractalus one of the best games EVER on the Atari 8bit Platform. The best part of it ? The ATARI version is the real "deal" and is way above all conversions as it was intended and developed by Lucasfilm Games for the Atari 8bit in mind. Couldn't be better ![CR][B]ZeeKat, 14/05/2006[/B][CR]Yeah, I was among Those, Who Almost Shat Their Pants at The Alien's Attack. Awesome.[CR][B]Penge, 06/05/2006[/B][CR]Is was that knocking on the door bit that always got me kakking it.[CR][B]Retro Kid, 13/04/2006[/B][CR]What an amazing game. It really did show off what the Atari 8-bits could do. The intro graphics were amazing on all the lucasfilm games (do you remember the space station thing with the ships flying out of it).[CR]But the moment that the alien popped up. Jeez, forgot your silent hills and resident evil. As a young boy staying up late to play the game, I just about had a heart attack. Even now when I play it as an adult, I still get anxious. Great.[CR][B]Neopeius, 25/02/2006[/B][CR]Back when I was the recipient of pirated games, I received a copy of "Rescumsn" which was sort of a demo version. It didn't have a space station sequence (started right in the launch bay) and there were no hero pilots, just white humans and white/green aliens.[CR]This was back in 1986.[CR][B]Houdi, 07/08/2005[/B][CR]Kris is spot on with his 'fear factor' comment. I remember playing this for this first time late one night on my own. I nearly had a heart attack when that hideous Jaggi jumped up at the window of my ship. Before I'd recovered from the shock he'd smashed the window and 'Game Over'. Even after many years of playing cutting edge PC games nothing has topped that moment for sheer terror in a computer game. Also the effects of flying through the mountains in Fractalus are the best ever on an 8-bit machine. Oh, and the superior Atari version knocks spots off the C64 version.[CR]Rates alongside Star Raiders and Dropzone in my opinion.[CR][B]Kr0tki, 12/05/2005[/B][CR]Type "AUTHOR" on level select screen to reveal credits.[CR][B]kris, 28/09/2004[/B][CR]A fantastic game with beautiful graphics. I will primarily remember the heart-stopping fear that I felt the first time I encountered an alien in front of my ship. Quite possibly the single scariest moment ever created in a computer game of that era. </plot>

I just discovered this site. It's great, but can't you zip these scannned docs into one file to make it easier to get them? [CR][B]Hawthorn, 18/02/2008[/B][CR]Yep, they're all correct.

And you might just learn some things about Classical Mythology along the way . . .[CR][B]Gideon Marcus, 02/11/2007[/B][CR]Yes, Return of Heracles was Ali Baba with all its faults fixed. I remember working a whole month to save up the cash to buy the game, and it didn't disappoint. [CR]To this day, I believe I have the ultimate high score: 9726. Even the author didn't think anything above 9650 was possible.[CR][B]JohnM, 06/08/2007[/B][CR]Return of the Heracles is my No.1 favourite [CR]Atari 8-bit adventure game. A few friends of mine would organise our selves for a gaming session and before you knew it a day would have past![CR]I also enjoyed Ali Baba but the control interface "asking to move" slowed down the flow of the game - fortunately though fixed in Heracles :).[CR][B]Rockpaste, 15/01/2007[/B][CR]Both this and "Ali Baba and the 40 Thieves" are two of the best and most underrated Atari 8-bit games. As a teen My D&amp;D; friends and I would set up 8 player hotseat games for this constantly. The replay value is great, and I consider Stuart Smith one of the great role-playing writers of that era. I only wish he had also released his construction set on the Atari platform.[CR][B]Malcolm, 11/02/2005[/B][CR]See my comments on Ali Baba. I also completed this one twice.</plot>

		<plot>[B]Daniel Thomas MacInnes, 09/05/2011[/B][CR]Classic videogame, but still a lazy 2600 port. Synapse's Blue Max, frankly, blew this game out of the water on the Atari 800.

The concept is simple (guide a salmon upstream to reach a mate, by jumping over waterfalls and diving underwater to camouflage yourself from predators) but the execution is perfect. Controls are responsive, the sound effect replicate ocean waves better than you'd imagine the A8 hardware could, and there's even a little animated reward after each level. Magical.</plot>

		<plot>[B]Michael Strorm, 29/10/2006[/B][CR]Fantastic and original game. You can't really compare it with anything else, except in very broad terms. The instructions make it sound a bit "educational", but it's actually a great arcade game. Eat the amoeba, and catch the falling eggs, else they eventually hatch into nasties which are hard to escape from- and if you don't get the eggs when they're falling, you have to catch a falling worm to get the immunity to venture amongst the stinging thingies and... okay, it's a whole lot more fun than it sounds. Great stuff!</plot>

I guess same fun we had with International Karate and later on Atari ST Speed Ball 2.[CR][B]Tezz, 25/06/2009[/B][CR]This is one of my all time favourite A8 games. really excellent with two players. We played this game to death back when it was released. Highly recommended.[CR][B]Thilo, 20/09/2007[/B][CR]Yes it was great. [CR]after ten years in 1997, we played again. [CR]a couple of hours (laugh) [CR][B]martin, 05/02/2006[/B][CR]Castle Schrechenstein. This should be famous.The "twirly-demon" to get strength back ,we would shout to eachother, ah now this is with Bill Willians + Russ Wetmore standards. Even the 2 Lucasfilm titles Eidolon and Koronis Rift would say we will let you become a classic like us. Enjoy the coins and be enchanted by the wishing wells.[CR][B]twh, 30/12/2005[/B][CR]This is with no question the best and most addictive two player jump'n'run game I ever played. This was the first game I ever had on my Atari (next to Elektraglide) and I am soooo happy that my parents found this piece of gold. If this game would have been released as a more international title it could have been easily THE game of the games on the 8bit. But so it's almost unkown outside of Germany, what a pitty!!!![CR][B]martin, 20/06/2004[/B][CR]this HAS to be THE 2 player platform/split screen adventure. please see the beautiful masterpiece and hear it's complex sounds. waste no more time!</plot>

[CR]ive been thinking about rewriting this. soon.[CR][B]Jonny EOL, 12/11/2006[/B][CR]Thankfully, the manual has been preserved here - and you really do need it to play (also used it for science homework once!). Released pre-Chernobyl, this relic of the nuclear age makes the heavy-going sciences of nuclear energy as enjoyable as possible, as you battle to keep your power plant operational in an earthquake zone.[CR][B]Brentski, 18/08/2006[/B][CR]An interesting 'game'. Really a simulation, but still good fun. The instruction manual is intense; containing large excerpts from the investigation of the Three-Mile Island accident, and a lengthy discussion of how a Nuclear power plant works. Heady stuff for the time, even now...[CR]This was also my first video game hack. The program was coded in Atari BASIC. You would first load the code from cassette (yes, cassette tape), and then run it. Before you ran the code, you could alter it if you took the time to understand a bit of it. Anyway, I altered it so that the generator was not capped for maximum power output; also increased the number of workers by a factor of 10. (workers were vital to repair damage, and were a consumed resourse; you could only use a group once due to radiation exposure rules, damn you NRC!)[CR]Melting down the reactor was always good for a grin. And the alarm sound for 'Steam Voiding' still enters into select nightmares of mine.[CR]If you can get ahold of the manual (not my copy, sorry) this is certainly worth the time. Otherwise I doubt you will have a clue what is going on.</plot>

		<plot>[B]Flyerdommo, 05/10/2013[/B][CR]One of the first home computer games that totally captivated me. The element of surprise combined with a huge unknown playing field, an unheard of number of possible moves and the outstanding New World Editor made this into a singular gaming experience in the early 80s. Plus, it even has an air of historical accuracy about it. One of the few lasting masterpieces. I still play it for fun on my old Atari 8 bitter on occasions. Absolutely brilliant![CR][B]Shatter, 09/08/2013[/B][CR]I played this games for months if not years it was always one of my favs - I would def buy it again if they gave it an update to current systems. I remember trying to keep natives happy but that never really seemed to go well for me... much easier to kill them off...

The opening title sequence is great, too. I was always only average at the game. I would discover a lot of the Americas, bring home the gold, and all I got was fair/poor rating. And the kingdom commended me for being good to the natives. It also didn't help much if the crew died off at established forts and missions![CR][B]Enrique Gánem, 01/06/2007[/B][CR]It was very simple (a little too simple for my comfort). If you use the atari800 emulator from sourceforge (linux and windows versions freely available), all you have to do is press F1, go to the Disk Management menu and select the creation of a blank atr file. The load the game, and when you are asked to create a new world, just press F1 again, go to the same menu, and select the empty disk as D2, then switch the disks, press ESC to return to the emulator, and press START (F4 in this emulator, I believe). I am travelling again. Thanks![CR][B]Jim Kuchera, 31/12/2006[/B][CR]This was the most beautiful game ever written for the Atari 8-Bit. Bunten presented to the user a wonderful real time challenge in discovering the new world. You knew this was going to be a fine game from the opening screen with fine music. It is nothing like M.U.L.E., the author's other great title, but for a single player game, this one fascinated both me, and my children, back in the early 80's. Again, like M.U.L.E., this game had the most elaborate packaging of any game I've ever seen. It is much more rare than the 'rarity scale' suggests. Like all of these Atari games, yes, they play with an emulator, but it just isn't the same as playing through the original game console. I love this one!!![CR][B]Enrique Gánem, 14/12/2006[/B][CR]This is one of my favorite games.[CR]However, I have problems with my emulator. I start the first image, then load the second image. but I cannot make the system go beyond the start of the map generation stage (by the way, I am using the emulator on SOURCEFORGE.NET - I am a Linux user).[CR]I would appreciate your help.[CR][B]Rod Lauder, 15/08/2005[/B][CR]I "rediscovered" this game after 20 years - I still love it.It was great to read Dan Bunten's comments! I couldn't find my manual, so having it here helped to remind me how to make the historical world (vs only random worlds). Thanks![CR][B]Pratik Patel, 08/08/2004[/B][CR]Ha! I'll show this to Jim Rushing (he's one of the managers at EA HQ now). I'm sure he'll be proud that people still remember one of his early efforts!</plot>

YOU NEVER GET ANY FEEDBACK FOR ALL THOSE BRUSHSTROKES AND HUNDREDS OF HOURS.[CR]I LIKED SHAMUS...[CR][B]Scott Wozniak, 15/09/2008[/B][CR]I remember buying Shamus on cartridge from J&amp;R; Computer World in NYC around 1982 for my Atari 400. (I was 13 at the time.) I bought it because I was fascinated with Tim Boxell's artwork and the Shamus character. I would see Synapse Software's ads all the time in magazines like Electronic Games. To this day it is probably my favorite game for the Atari 8-bit computers. The depth of the exploration amazed me. I played for hours and finished it (on Novice) the first day. I was obsessed. A trick I quickly learned is to hold down the fire button and tap the joystick very quickly to clear out enemies in groups. I think this game is a masterpiece. To think William Mataga crammed all of that gameplay into just 16k of memory! 10 out of 10 score from me. Why did so many programmers from that era (including William Mataga) undergo sex change operations???[CR][B]JohnM, 06/08/2007[/B][CR]An excellent addictive arcade game.[CR]Fast, lots of hidden extras, plenty of enemies with differing attack styles, lots of rooms/ levels, beautiful graphics throughout, super smooth motion and animations.[CR]Quite incredible to think this was written in 1982.[CR]............[CR]Much harder to play on a PC emulator though as this really does need the digital joystick</plot>

Once you've adjusted to the game-play and controls you can overcome the obstacles (even the "sliding ladders" that at first seem impossible). I've just finished the "Novice" level and mapped it out...once the "shadow is dead" on Novice, you're sent back to the beginning at Intermediate...I don't know if there are map differences at the higher level. Advice: read the instructions, save often, shoot diagonally, and try to keep at least one platform available in the corner (preferably under an barrier).[CR][B]Jonny EOL, 11/11/2006[/B][CR]A nice mix of jump'n'run, shoot-em-up and map-it-out. Whilst not amongst the greatest of 8-bit games, it's a decent challenge and offers a fair bit of variety into the bargain.</plot>

		<plot>[B]Adrian Harverson, 25/05/2013[/B][CR]At a glance this is maybe nothing special and likely even a bit rubbish to most, but further play can certainly reveal an exceptional depth both from the physics calculations and game design. It takes a while to get past how awfully slow it feels in comparison to how you would expect it to but this translates over time into an illusion of weight and speed you will appreciate- a reason in itself why this is a great example of technical simplicity exceeding what is capable on much better modern hardware. By today's standards it's perhaps laughable but given a real chance it can be both addictive and satisfying more so than anything you've played in this genre. Very detailed and fun. Printed out maps are however essential if you're to plot using vor stations- something even more satisfying when flying in total cloud blindness and then emerging at your intended destination[CR]All this coupled with a speed based scoring system that has you planning not just routes but how much fuel and mail you should risk adding as weight ie actual calculations will apply to the various handling aspects of flight . The effects then of a well planned flight can make all the difference to how you score well and it's here you should carefully calculate how much fuel per delivery and distance you might need. Weight a determining factor eventually sees you test at what the physics allows to be airborne and it's here you'll start to push just how much mail you can load up but with as little fuel needed. It can be particularly satisfying taking off with an exceptionally heavy loaded plane and then bringing it down to safety at the next runway. Solo Flight in this sense is very dynamic [CR]Worth mentioning again that there still isn't anything out there like this even now some 30 years on[CR][B]greg heller, 30/03/2008[/B][CR]really enjoy this game. i really like the mail delivery mini game[CR][B]Jonny EOL, 12/02/2008[/B][CR]A reasonable flight-sim with (in this edition) a useful instructor mode. The behind-the-plane view wasn't best for realism and like most flight sims on this computer, it wasn't that smooth, but it was enjoyable enough.</plot>

I suggest adjusting the brightness and contrast on the TV until the flicker is less distracting. The colours will end up looking duller, but easier on the eyes.[CR]Maybe the Moderators can consider putting this info (or a summary of it) into the comments section for the game? Thanks[CR][B]steve, 07/09/2012[/B][CR]Oh if only this was done in the eighties! This game is an incredible port of the 80's sega classic. It has all the playability of the original, and so much more than other 8 bit ports. The amazing speed, graphics, fluid gameplay and music are all present./ It really is a game you want to come back to again and again. How was this done? Chris should get a knighthood for this work. A modern atari classic. Outstanding.[CR][B]FastRobPlus, 04/09/2012[/B][CR]By playing to the Atari’s strengths, Sheddy has re-written Space Harrier history and retroactively created an outstanding 8-bit port.

		<plot>[B]Velcro_SP, 06/06/2009[/B][CR]Space Invaders for 8bit doesn't have any forts to hide under? How inauthentic. The colors are welcome but the changed alien shapes are not. The action is okay and it moves pretty smoothly. Atari did some mediocre conversions, it would have done well to invest and cultivate the programming talent more. Imagine if coders on par with those that LucasArts (Rescue on Fractalus, etc.) or Activision had had been used for Space Invaders and Asteroids etc. Those versions would have been authentic and masterful. This version is barely better than "okay" as a game itself and doesn't include all the Space Invaders elements.[CR][B]eppy2000, 08/09/2008[/B][CR]This was one conversion that was inferior to the arcade and 2600 version. For a big named arcade game at the time, why did Atari mess this one up? Even their own Asteroids was a substandard conversion. [CR]One issue is that the invaders were redesigned, so they don't resemble the original characters. The other is having the invaders come out of that thing (I forgot if that was a mother ship or something). You can shoot as many invaders as you can before they're fully on the playing field -- a bit of an unfair advantage if you ask me!</plot>

		<plot>[B]eppy2000, 28/03/2008[/B][CR]This was deliciously wacky! Running an arcade never seemed to be so much fun. Your nemesis, the Zerks, are the bane of your livelihood. Well, at least when it came to preventing you from getting a good score and advancing to the next level. The game had great cartoony styled animation that was equally as fun during the intermissions, too. Great game, backed with fun sound and music, too. You need plenty of good timing and skillfully moving the joystick around to get on top of things.[CR][B]Hawthorn, 18/02/2008[/B][CR]One of the greatest and one of the most creative of Atari's games. Fun, addictive and clever all in one. If you havn't played, try it out! One of the very few games I give a 10 to. </plot>

		<plot>[B]Daniel Thomas MacInnes, 09/05/2011[/B][CR]Spelunker was a great action platformer on the Atari 800, but Tim Whatshisname should be beaten with an ugly stick for mangling the controls. It's far too easy to fall off ropes or ladders, or just get killed by tripping on something. If you're a fat spelunker who gets killed so easily, maybe you should stay home.[CR][B]Gwobby, 31/05/2010[/B][CR]Great Game! Loads of information and link to Spelunker Manual here:[CR]http://www.atariage.com/forums/topic/160891-spelunker-manual/page__p__1980794__hl__spelunker__fromsearch__1#entry1980794[CR][B]Muffy St. Bernard, 25/05/2010[/B][CR]@Clark923, I think it's "D" for dynamite, "F" for flare, and SPACE to kill the ghosts.[CR][B]CLARK923, 11/05/2010[/B][CR]I recently played spelunker, but it's been over 20 years and I cannot remember or find the keyboard instructions (commands) does anyone know where I can find them?[CR][B]lotek style, 01/04/2010[/B][CR]After quite a while I did manage to play it to the end. Quite cool game![CR][B]Mario, 23/09/2009[/B][CR]This was my favorite game on the Atari computers. It is a great platformer, with a great feeling of truely exploring a dangerous cave system. The controls are a bit unforgiving, but one can master them and really enjoy the game. The subsequent arcade and Nintendo NES versions are horrible in comparison to the original. Even if you don't like those, give the Atari version a try.[CR][B]John, 29/05/2009[/B][CR]This was one of my favorite games on the Atari. After playing many, many times, I reached the final pyramid, then lost the game one jump short of the endgame. I didn't know I had gotten so close to the end until more than 10 years later, when I finished the game on an emulator.[CR][B]Muffy St. Bernard, 25/11/2007[/B][CR]I did manage to finish the game on an 800XL long ago...no crashing. But there was definitely a bug at the waterfall; about 50% of the time you'd just get stuck at the bottom of the falls.[CR][B]Paulio, 21/11/2007[/B][CR]Yeah Gourdin, I can only get to the pyramid using an emulator. In the past on my Atari 800, the game would always crash at the same point. GREAT platformer game.[CR][B]gourdin, 08/10/2007[/B][CR]amazing game[CR]I played a lot this game, I only reach the pyramid replaying it under an emulator :)[CR]I think this was the best game I played on my atari800xl[CR][B]Siegfried Lenz, 25/09/2005[/B][CR]One of the "great" Atari 8-bit games.

		<plot>[B]Jonny EOL, 11/11/2006[/B][CR]Possibly my favorite game on the 8-bit. Taking the Marble Madness concept but giving you the freedom to explore a gigantic isometric world, this game got everything right - a mixture of problem-solving and joystick agility, the multiple paths of exploration (that made much of the game accessible from the start but kept the outer areas beyond the reach of all but the best players), not to mention the sheer scale of the thing. I spent hours playing this. And a remake for modern platforms is due in 2007![CR][B]antic, 18/12/2004[/B][CR]one of the best[CR]like the original</plot>

Outright winners of the Shneider trophy with the aeroplane that was developed to become the Spitfire.[CR][B]Daniel Thomas MacInnes, 09/05/2011[/B][CR]Another awesome addition to Sid Meier's series of "Ace" sim shooters. To be honest, this is more of an arcade game than a proper sim, so it's not in the same league as F-15 or Flight Simulator. But that takes nothing away from the action and excitement. I think this was my second-favorite after Mig Alley Ace.</plot>

		<plot>[B]Baz, 30/09/2013[/B][CR]One of those timeless classics which always had one thinking "oh, I'll have another go!" and always trying to pass through that port thing to go into the water sequences. Involved a lot of skill and trickery and was a pretty zippy game for it's time. Very impressive and hugely replayable.[CR][B]Daniel Thomas MacInnes, 09/05/2011[/B][CR]I thought the Atari 800 version of Spy Hunter was better than the NES version. One of the best arcade racers of the 80s, always challenging, always fast, and always fun to smack into enemy cars and see them crash. Every driving game should let you crash the other cars.[CR][B]eppy2000, 24/10/2009[/B][CR]A very good arcade conversion, even including Henry Mancini's iconic theme from "Peter Gunn" playing throughout. The graphics and sound are well done, adding to the fun while you're speeding through the roads trying to avoid enemies all around.[CR]There's one annoying bug that pops up every-so-often: after you crash your car or boat, your weapons van is nowhere to be seen (even when you have extra cars in reserve), thus putting the game in a no-win situation.[CR]Another quirk (easter egg?), one that's also in the C-64 edition, is after your car is deployed from the weapons van, if you move the car to the far right of the screen, you and run its course on the terrain without worrying about crashing. You don't get any points, but this comes in very handy for the hard-to-steer icy road conditions. Just ride it out and once it becomes clear again, drive onto the road.[CR][B]espi, 22/05/2006[/B][CR]This version seems to be similar to the version of C64...</plot>

		<plot>[B]Daniel Thomas MacInnes, 10/05/2011[/B][CR]Doesn't look like much today, but in the mid-80s, this was like the Second Coming for die-hard Trekkies. You lived and breathed this game and reenacted epic battles against the Klingons. If you beat the game, you're supposed to get a certificate from the game's designers. Still waiting for mine. 10/10.</plot>

		<plot>[B]Flyerdommo, 05/10/2013[/B][CR]I've never been a great baseball fan (and that's putting it mildly) but I always liked this game. From today's standpoint, it's fairly impressive how the programmers managed to boil down the essence of this game into a format manageable by the limited capacities of 8-bit computers. The physics of pitching and throwing are pretty convincing and the game can be great fun.[CR][B]Daniel Thomas MacInnes, 10/05/2011[/B][CR]Gamestar managed to create very solid baseball and football games for that Atari 800. Star League Baseball was beaten in every way by Hardball, but there's no shame in coming in second. As a kid, I still had fresh memories of Home Run on the 2600. So anything was bound to be better, right?[CR][B]Gray, 29/10/2008[/B][CR]For an extra challenge, set your team options to "Curves - Liners" and the computer team options to "Heat - Sluggers" and try to win a game against the Atari. [CR][B]eppy2000, 09/10/2007[/B][CR]This was a long time favorite of mine, until Hardball! came along. But I still enjoy both. The gameplay is very smooth and intuitive. It has a little of everything from the real game: the National Anthem, organ music when players are in scoring position, and a nice drum roll when you hit a home run. I also love the scoreboard in-between innings. This is something I wish was in the MVP baseball series from Electronic Arts! </plot>

		<plot>[B]Garbage Scow Cpt. Cls. 5, 13/05/2014[/B][CR]Was fortunate to enjoy this in my youth. This game, to me personally, was the equivalent of the ebay toy tugboat commercial. To enjoy this game now in my adulthood i realize why my dad enjoyed it more than any other game we had for the 400. A Masterpiece[CR][B]mark_h, 07/01/2014[/B][CR]I was 14 when this came out, we had no money growing up so I knew I would never get even the cheapes video game system at home. My only exposure was walking to the local mall and playing demos of video game systems in the various stores. When I saw Star Raiders for the first time, I thought it was a work of art. The detail of the simulation was incredible given the state of the hardware back then. If I had the money I would have bought an Atari computer on the spot.[CR][B]JeffG, 27/01/2013[/B][CR]This game was the real reason why we bought the 800 in the first place.[CR][B]Norm, 29/04/2012[/B][CR]Tom, you're right on the money. This awesome game was superior to even the arcade games of the time. It was quite immersive. I give it a 10/10![CR][B]Tom, 12/02/2012[/B][CR]Only 8/10? Is someone high??? Not only the best game of its time, but still considered one of the best space shooters even in the 21st century, Star Raiders is the foundation on which all other space sims are built on and try to match.[CR][B]jcat, 28/04/2011[/B][CR]This was the game that instantly sold me on an Atari 400 computer during its debut month. This was not short of spectacular in its heyday - and there was nothing else like it. There was a 3rd party attempted clone for the Apple called Space Raiders - which wasn't bad, but next to Star Raiders - it didn't have a chance in hell. I played this over and over and brought my 400 where ever I was visiting! Later on I graduated to the 800 and spent the early 80's with the best computer ever made. The only thing that bugged me about Star Raiders was the "Shield" effect. I much preferred shooting alien ships against the black star filled backdrop instead of that blue (or green?) tint effect when the shields were active.[CR][B]Akira808, 29/04/2010[/B][CR]This was better than the one on the 2600!! I've finished the Commander mission, and boy, is it hard!! I had a 800 before, and thanks through emulation, I can play these games!! Star Raiders remains my favorite, because of the challenge!! Kudos go to those responsible for making this great game!![CR][B]Rene Castro, 26/02/2010[/B][CR]This game was the reason I bought an Atari 400 as my first computer. I had just entered the USAF and didn't have the big bucks to buy the 800. But as luck would have it I got the upgraded version of the 400 with 16K mem![CR]Anyway, what I really wanted to say was now there is an update to this game and it's portable! Follow this link and enjoy: http://www.analogretro.com/StarRangers/[CR]This is awesome![CR][B]Raymond Rivera, 18/05/2009[/B][CR]A classic of the 8bit era and groundbreaking. 3D environment, basic but very strong game mechanics and high frame rates. I played the classic 8bit Star Raiders and tried to find an equivalent in the 16bit Atart ST and Amiga generation but to no avail. Star Raiders II looked pretty but dumbed down the gameplay!? Atari ST's Enterprise game was more true to form but lacked the excellent and fluid high frame rate from the 8bit version. The classic should be a lesson to game designers on how to do things right.[CR][B]onky, 01/07/2008[/B][CR]A good example of clever programming within a tight 8k framework. Star Raiders offers a deep space combat game which is still very playable today. Recommended![CR][B]Martin Kiszel, 01/02/2008[/B][CR]This is a top game for its age. No other computer had anything close to the game play and instant ROM cartridge start up.[CR]The 3D player (sprite) graphics are amazing, with sounds that give you realism.[CR]Interesting that a certain revive comments on bugs.....there are no bug in this game.. its damage done by zylons, realistic simulation stuff!!! Brilliant. Bring back the good old days.[CR]MK[CR][B]Yungstar, 30/10/2007[/B][CR]the reason i spent £350 on an Atari 400 (my first computer) was this very game. an amazing amount of game has been stuffed into an 8k cart, an easy 11/10 if ever there was.[CR][B]eppy2000, 07/10/2007[/B][CR]A definition of a classic. Pac-Man and Star Raiders were the very first two games to go along with my brand new Atari 800. Initially, I was taken aback by the complexity of the manual, but after awhile, I was able to play the game with ease. There was no Star Wars games available to play on the computer, and this more than suited me fine. There was so much put into the game within the system limitations of the day, which is why it's still so solid even today. That aside, I've never mastered the game after all these years! I can finish the Commander mode, but I have to make too many pitstops to finish in a timely manner. Those darn Zylons always do substantial damage before I can defend myself.[CR][B]Andreas Koch, 23/07/2007[/B][CR]Well, when I played Star Raiders the first few times on my 64k XL I did not like it, due to some bugs of the cart. Believe it or not, some carts are faulty, meaning when you press Control-G you get garbage instead of the galactic map. (I bought some more carts with the same bug.) Later I got some bug-free cart, this one works now, but it does some strange things on my nowadays expanded 576k 800XL, so I always have to switch back to 800 OS and 48k mode... but then it is a very good and enjoyable game.[CR][B]Jim Kuchera, 04/04/2007[/B][CR]Everyone should own this game. The first time I saw an 800, this game was running on it. I immediately dumped my Apple II, and bought the 800, which to my delight included the Star Raiders cart. To this day, I remember the thrill I got from this game. It's still has great playability, and gets plenty tough as you gain rank. I destroyed more than a few joysticks while saving the galaxy. Do you now feel safer that the galaxy is saved???!!! Truly, this game should be in every gamers cart box because it defines the word 'classic'. I'm glad it's so readily available.[CR][B]Nixon, 17/04/2006[/B][CR]mmmh the spacecraft on the frontbox looks exactly as vaders tie fighter xD...[CR][B]Callipygous, 22/04/2005[/B][CR]Be sure to visit Bill Kendrick's Star Raiders Tribute page at http://www.sonic.net/~nbs/star-raiders/</plot>

I played this really a lot in my childhood :)[CR][B]Andreas Koch, 18/07/2009[/B][CR]I got an Atari 800XL at XMAS 1984 and when I got a tape recorder eight months later, this game became one of my favourites. The gfx are much better than in Star Raiders, alas there are only three levels (ten levels would have been much nicer)...[CR]-Andreas Koch.[CR][B]Nixon, 16/04/2006[/B][CR]I liked the last Starfighter Version better since it was featured(not the 8bit game itself though) in that real cool movie with that title:D[CR][B]Andrew Berstein, 05/03/2005[/B][CR]Both the cartridge and disk versions are amazingly only 16ko. Quite an achievement.[CR]Note for Daniel Cadiz: SR2 is easier than the first Star Raiders but it's much more of an action game, less of a simulation (The previous Last Starfighter release is even more of an action game for those who want to try).[CR][B]Daniel Cádiz, 06/02/2005[/B][CR]Probably it's the best game of starships that I've played in Atari. In comparision with the predecesor game, Star Raiders II it's very much easiest and the graphics are really better than Star Raiders.[CR][B]Andy Bernstein, 06/07/2004[/B][CR]An interesting article which points out the differences between Star Raiders II and its true predecessor, The Last Starfighter, can be found at the following address: http://www.atarihq.com/atcomp/lastsr2.html[CR][B]The Doctor, 16/06/2004[/B][CR]Liberty Star, Gun Star...Celos IV, Rylos---it's all the same to me...all in all though both games are quite enjoyable to play.</plot>

		<plot>[B]Coach Ota, 03/09/2007[/B][CR]When I was 8 years old this was one of my favorite games. It wasn't much to look at but it was one of the few Star Trek themed games at the time and captured the basic feeling of flying around exploring and blasting Klingons. It was written in BASIC which meant I could even tinker around with the graphics and effects as a bonus.</plot>

		<plot>[B]eppy2000, 06/10/2007[/B][CR]This was a modest improvement over the mediocre one that Parker Bros. put out. The game plays better and has more of the arcade feel to it. But it's not much easier! I seem to miss the TIE fighters more than I'm hitting them, and they never seem to have any problems shooting at me. I also find hitting the exhaust port to be hit-or-miss (pun intended) like the Parker Bros. version. Dodging and firing at the fireballs is also problematic. You're almost always hit and you lose shields. The sound effects could be better, and without John Williams' inspiring music playing throughout, it's hard to get into the mood of being Luke Skywalker.[CR][B]andy_bernstein, 26/08/2004[/B][CR]This is the best Star Wars game available on the XL/XE. Compared to the previous 1984 Parker Bros Release (16ko) which mostly used sprites due to memory limitations, this full 64ko release (1988) uses vector graphics very much like the original arcade game (the only drawback is that it is somewhat slower than the Parker release but it's quickly forgotten). A nice loading screen (disc only) and an enthusiastic soundtrack complete a very well made package. Zeppelin rules !!!</plot>

		<plot>[B]Daniel Thomas MacInnes, 08/05/2011[/B][CR]Games like Summer Games are why Epyx was legendary. This was probably their best game on the Atari 800 (pity we never got Impossible Mission), and it's a different take on the Track-n-Field sports games. The designers put much more thought into the events than simple joystick waggling.[CR]Diving was always a favorite, pole vaulting a close second. The running and swimming events were more boring, and gymnastics was damn near impossible to figure out - once we learned what to do, it became much more fun.[CR]To my mind, this is still the gold standard in Olympics videogames.[CR][B]eppy2000, 26/08/2008[/B][CR]I always played the diving portion the most since it was a lot of fun and didn't require any joystick pounding or as much critical timing and coordination as the others. I liked the gymnastics, too. My sister, much to my chagrin, regularly got a perfect "10," back-to-back, so I never could beat that score! Never cared for the skeet shoot. I missed more than I hit. The swimming events were a little tedious.[CR]There was one HIGHLY annoying bug. If you got a "DQ" on the swimming freestyle events, that became a world record and you could not undo or beat that score. Unless of course, you got another DQ![CR][B]Andreas Koch, 18/08/2007[/B][CR]Well,[CR]the cart. version differs from the disk version:[CR]- max. 3 players can play[CR]- no highscore / olympic records save option[CR]There is still the option to play one or all events (but it is still mising to play more than one but less than all events, e.g. to choose several events out of the eight available ones)... And with the cart. version one no more has to be a disk-jockey ("turn disk over")...[CR][B]Maggi1971, 01/01/2007[/B][CR]I liked this game. It was a sports simulation, not a "jostick-killer" as Decathlion was.[CR]Summer Games, Winter Games and World Games where much better than this one, but these titles never appeared on the Atari 800. Shame on you, Epyx!!! [CR] [CR][B]Jonny EOL, 12/11/2006[/B][CR]8 events, 18 national anthems and a decent mix of joystick mashing, careful timing and technicalities. Swimming relays were a bit dull, but otherwise a top sports sim.[CR][B]Nixon, 17/04/2006[/B][CR]a nice summer olympic game, the events have niceg graphics and a cool gameplay esp. in multiplayer mode, one of the wasted wrists/joysticks game..</plot>

		<plot>[B]Daniel Thomas MacInnes, 09/05/2011[/B][CR]This is a pretty good version of Super Breakout. Graphics are slightly improved over the 2600 version, but this isn't really a graphics-heavy game, is it? It's just Atari's legacy in the 70s (alongside Pong). Interesting how games like Breakout and Arkanoid continue to be popular today.</plot>

		<plot>[B]zak, 20/07/2012[/B][CR]This is quality by L.D. just like Donkey Kong.[CR][B]Jim Kuchera, 03/04/2007[/B][CR]Super Pac-Man is an elegant piece of work. It verges on an art form because it's so bright, lively, and playable. The emulators don't do justice to playing it on an Atari 800, or equivalent Atari. There is something unseemly about playing an Atari game on anything other than an authentic Atari 8-bitter. I love this game, but still my heart belongs to the original Pac-Man. Oh, skip MsPac-Man. I never really understood what that's about, unless it was written for the distaff side. Go gobble some ghosts.</plot>

		<plot>[B]GADZombie, 07/05/2014[/B][CR]There is another title for this game on Commodore 64: "Cave Climber". It also exists on C64 as "Rock 'n Rope"[CR][B]Thorsten Günther, 28/01/2011[/B][CR]This is an excellently balanced platformer (albeit obviously an unlicensed clone of Roc'n'Rope). I had the pleasure to play it on ABBUC Bundesliga #8/05 and was able to achieve the second highest score.[CR][B]Jimmy Biggler, 10/09/2010[/B][CR]It does look a lot like Roc 'n Rope, but I haven't been able to find anything about an 8 bit port. It's basically the same game with 8 bit graphics. It's actually looks a lot like the arcade version of Roc n' Rope. Thanks.[CR][B]Tempest, 09/09/2010[/B][CR]Looks like a Roc 'n Rope clone to me. I never knew there was an 8-bit port.[CR][B]Jimmy Biggler, 09/09/2010[/B][CR]I believe this game had a US release under another title. A friend of mine introduced me to this game the same day he introduced me to Beach Head and Star Wars. It's an interesting twist on the single screen platform formula, throwing grappling hooks and climbing from ledge to ledge. This game is still as fun today as it ever was. If anyone knows about the US release of this game (or if there was a super similar game to this one that I'm thinking of) please comment.</plot>

		<plot>[B]Muffy St. Bernard, 28/04/2008[/B][CR]If the main appeal for you is the huge persistent dungeon, be prepared for a disappointment...it's simply too big and monotonous to practical. It doesn't help that you're never given X or Y coordinates, nor ever told which dungeon level you're on; when you hit a teleporter you can only throw up your hands and start mapping all over again because you'll never figure out where you've ended up.[CR][B]Muffy St. Bernard, 03/04/2008[/B][CR]The documentation doesn't give you much information about the size and permanence of the map, so here's what I've discovered (both by mapping the game and by looking at the C-64 source code). The map is 200x200 and you begin the game only a few steps from the western edge, on the top level. The map is procedurally generated so it IS the same each time you play. Due to the algorithm you'll notice that many of the larger areas skew in a north-easterly direction. Monsters and treasures are totally random, but all other dungeon features (stairs, pits, thrones, etc.) are always in the same spots. The source code shows that a complex algorithm is used to determine the results of teleportation, which sometimes results in you going down one or two map levels. Each teleporter has a destination which is the same in every game...except 20% of the time, in which case the algorithm is run again (and potentially again, and again...).</plot>

		<plot>[B]Daniel Thomas MacInnes, 11/05/2011[/B][CR]Tail of Beta Lyrae is always on my short-list of all time favorite Atari 800 games. Exceptional graphics, animation and music, some of the best of the system's '80s heyday. The random layouts are a masterstroke. Oh, and the escaping aliens at the end remind me of Girl Scout Cookies. I like cookies. My teeth hurt.[CR][B]Greg B., 02/02/2011[/B][CR]Houdi, no offense, but I think Caverns of Mars II is a MUCH better Scramble clone than this. TOBL is the only game on the 8-bit where the intro is better than the game itself.[CR][B]Gwobby, 27/11/2010[/B][CR]Whart we need is an image of a new or not played much disk - someone must have one - Please, please post it! The game is much more fun with the Gravity balls![CR][B]FrakAttack, 23/08/2008[/B][CR]I believe what some have mistaken as a copy protection scheme, harder enemies, flashing screens, etc., was actually a gameplay feature. One of the selling points of this game was that it had a primitive form of adaptive difficulty, meaning, the game kept count of how many times you played it (hence, the need to write to disk) and introduced new challenges as your play-count grew. Not sure if there was a way to reset the difficulty, though.[CR]Still can't get that music out of my head! [CR][B]Karl Heller, 05/02/2008[/B][CR]This game did have a copy protection scheme. In addition, it had to be run from a notched disk so the program could write to it as you advanced. If you played it with a w/o a notch (or if you copied it) the gravity balls (?) would appear more often and kill you quickly. [CR][B]Ben Combee, 24/01/2008[/B][CR]IIRC, this game had a copy-protection scheme where if it thought it was playing on a copied disk, it would turn the background light, making it harder to play. Unfortunately, this scheme would sometimes also affect legitimate disks, including the copy I owned. This would explain the "metallic look" comments.[CR][B]Jonny EOL, 02/07/2007[/B][CR]This horizontal scrolled wasn't the best graphically, but the action-packed, varied gameplay and excellent music more than made up for it. The aliens had all kinds of weapons to throw at you, and you needed lightning reflexes to be able to dodge them all at anything other than the easiest difficulty levels. [CR][B]Yungstar 2006, 28/08/2006[/B][CR]i never liked the game, but the music is great[CR][B]Jesse, 04/01/2006[/B][CR]I had a different version of this and graphics looked very different... It had two modes of play... one scramble type and the other very mettalic and dimensioned in the city scene itself it was awsome and lost it seems now. Please if anybody can recover the awsome version I remember it ran on my 800XL but there was a problem with the DOS they used causing it to corrupt over time. It made me an 8 bit addict.[CR][B]Houdi, 07/08/2005[/B][CR]Don't agree with the above comments. This game is based on Scramble not Defender and is easily the best Scramble clone on the 8-bit machines. The accompanying music themes (a different end theme depending on the the score achieved) are worth playing the game for alone. Don't know about the validity of the screen shots above as I seem to remember everything being much more 'metallic' in appearance.</plot>

		<plot>[B]Jim Kuchera, 08/10/2008[/B][CR]When our boys were preteen, they fell in love with this game when I brought it home from our local computer game store. It's very similar to River Raid, but this time you have a pterodactyl (now there's a mouthful) shooting laser blasts against spiders. You can increase/decrease your vertical progress, and X-Y axis is complete as the lair continues to scroll to the bottom of the screen. The graphics are crude, and the audio f/x are weak, but the game is compelling at the same time mindless. Like River Raid, this is a thumb-number. I recommend it.</plot>

		<plot>[B]Jim Kuchera, 13/12/2006[/B][CR]This was my first Atari 'shooter'. It's a stunner because it never stops coming at you with increasingly difficult, but doable, levels of play. It matches play very closely with the arcade game "Astroblaster", which was great fun. I bought this game as a 'mind number', and it does the trick. You'll get a case of carpal tunnel syndrome playing this great game. If you can find a copy, buy it and then plan to spend hours saving the earth from the relentless attacks of monsters from space intent on destroying your way of life---and stealing your Atari!</plot>

Land your ball on the right colored tiles and avoid the wrong ones. Great sense of speed - especially if you hit the warp tile WHOOSH!!, nice feature of carrying leftover time to the next stage.

		<plot>[B]Auntie Pastie, 05/06/2007[/B][CR]This game's as slow as treacle. To make things worse, the graphics look like they've been lifted from the ZX Spectrum (i.e. 256x192 detail but low colour resolution) and transferred to the Atari's medium-res mode, without compensating by exploiting per-pixel colour resolution. Result is the worse of both worlds.... look at that ship design, ugh.[CR][B]BrunoN, 30/05/2004[/B][CR]Not so smooth and fast paced, but diverse and absorbing. Weapons/bonuses system is bit similiar to amiga's Project X. </plot>

It's more similar to arcade version and it's pretty good.[CR][B]Daniel Thomas MacInnes, 10/05/2011[/B][CR]I'm getting 1980s flashbacks...Miami Vice...Transformers...Bill Cosby...Weird Al Yankovic...Grandmaster Mel Mel...and Tutankham on Atari 800. I really loved this game, played it to pieces, probably should have spent more time outdoors instead of being locked up in front of a monitor. Ahem. 7/10.[CR][B]http://gwobby.webs.com/, 28/07/2010[/B][CR]What u talkin about?! This is a good game, side scrolling levels, collect keys, treasures, avoid and kill baddies or are you the baddie stealing their treasure?! Supports use of 2nd joystick to aim firing (you can only shoot left or right) use button for bomb to clear all baddies. Colour schemes are a bit wappy, but press select to change level after your go and level 3 is legible. Fun to play, progressive difficulty. Nice to play on level 16 as the levels are bigger![CR][B]Paul Westphal, 14/10/2008[/B][CR]I did find this once on another site... homesoft?..it was on a multi-game download.. and it was terrible..might have been a prototype it was so bad.

		<plot>[B]kris, 12/01/2008[/B][CR]Ultima III was so much smaller in scope than Ultima IV that it was able to contain the full score of background music even on an 8-bit machine. I think I actually prefer this version because of that. It just so perfectly fit the mood of the game - the shrine music just sounded so beautiful after hours and hours of long tedious battles in the dark dungeons. Even now, I can recall how epic this game seemed.</plot>

		<plot>[B]Avalon, 23/03/2014[/B][CR]I don't understand the b/w, no music like the other poster either. I played Ultima III out of the box with full color and music on a 48K machine. Ultima IV also had full color and music too; strange...[CR][B]Mike, 30/01/2009[/B][CR]The game had sound just no music (no matter how much memory you had). Also, artifacting was used to produce color.[CR][B]Kris, 29/12/2008[/B][CR]You probably had an 800 with 64K for sound to be included with Ultima IV; I certainly did not and therefore this game doesn't have the same lasting memory for me as did Ultima III. Still, this was an awesome game; trying to find Magencia in the middle of that huge ocean was a monumental task; such a vast landscape to explore was entirely unheard of in this era.[CR][B]Auntie Pastie, 27/12/2008[/B][CR]Direwolf; I don't know about the sound, but judging by the screenshots above, I'd guess this game used "artifacted" colour. This was a trick which exploited a limitation of the NTSC TV signal to get colour in the supposedly monochrome hi-res mode. It did this by using certain patterns of black and white pixels which gave colour interference (similar to the type you got on TV when someone wore a finely-patterned jacket or whatever).[CR]Unfortunately, a "perfect" emulator display doesn't suffer from this "problem", so you don't get the colour. Fortunately, most emulators now include an option to simulate the effect, but you may have to turn it on.[CR]BTW, the patterns required to generate colour on NTSC Ataris didn't work on our European PAL ones, so all American games that relied on the technique looked lousy on our systems. :([CR][B]Direwolf, 26/12/2008[/B][CR]I don't understand.. I played this on an Atari 800 back in the day and it had color AND sound. Plus the sound was superior to the PC version. What gives?[CR][B]Jonny EOL, 11/11/2006[/B][CR]I eventually completed this game on the PC version (the 3rd platform I'd played it on). This game was arguably the first great open-ended RPG (the previous Ultimas led up to it), with a huge area to explore and all sorts of things to find out, not to mention the unusual aim of being a 'virtuous' person. Chatting to townspeople, exploring dungeons, hunting for artifacts, searching for spell reagents....I played Morrowind recently and was constantly reminded of this game. The Atari 8-bit version is sadly not the best (the lack of music hurts the 'mood' somewhat) but the essence of the game is still intact.[CR][B]FastRobPlus, 19/10/2006[/B][CR]Lack of music hurts this installment of the Ultima franchise. It would have been nice to see them support music on 64K or 128K machines. That said, the game does look and play as well as the other 8-bit versions.</plot>

		<plot>[B]LS, 11/04/2010[/B][CR]Great stuff.[CR][B]Andreas Koch, 25/01/2008[/B][CR]Well,[CR]the extra-levels had also been published in a Happy computer magazine (thus, Top Magazine was not the first!). They promised to publish the level-editor also, but alas, it never happened. But clever people found out how to add new levels to Unicum and so I have two or more versions (with different levels) of the game in my collection... -Andreas Koch.[CR][B]steve, 14/11/2007[/B][CR]Technically unicum is better programmed than arkanoid - the game that unicum is obviously developed from. The graphics sprite movement and handling are responsive, naturally so and are as smooth as silk. The sound is great too, it omits the sometimes questionable collision detection in arkanoid too. But let us not forget where this game is derived from. Excellent programming and highly enjoyable.[CR][B]Thorsten Günther, 08/11/2007[/B][CR]This is undoubtedly the best Arkanoid/Breakout version on the 8-bit Atari computer. Forget the awful official Arkanoid conversion.</plot>

		<plot>[B]W Hurst, 11/04/2014[/B][CR]Played this game when I was between wives and living in the barracks back in '85 or so. I loved this game, and all my friends had their own Atari 800s and also played. **I** was that only one that had eight disk drives daisy chained. (It may have been seven and a tape drive). Saved me a lot of disk swapping. You could almost FEEL the jealousy.[CR][B]Wm Leslie, 26/04/2011[/B][CR]@G Baker -- you can contact me at wgmleslie@gmail.com[CR][B]G Baker, 31/10/2010[/B][CR]I'm playing this on the AtariWin800 Plus emulator on a PC. I'm still looking for the booster, but I decided to try to write the game in C++. I'd like to eventually run it in a normal window, but I'm still learning the Window API (with much difficulty). For now I'm running the game in console mode. I'm shamelessly stealing screenshots from the game in the emulator. I don't have any plans to do anything with my version of the game for now except play it myself and learn to program again. But if I get anything worth sharing eventually I'd like to get approval from the folks who wrote the original to use their material in my version. Not sure this is strictly necessary, legally, but I have a great deal of respect for them and their work that I wouldn't consider sharing anything I do without their consent. I'm including all the credit screens in my version, even if it never leaves my computer. [CR]So if anyone knows how to reach them I'd appreciate some contact info. I noticed Wm Leslie posted here, so maybe he'll check back. Thanks.[CR][B]Wm Leslie, 08/10/2010[/B][CR]Actually, Universe was written in Valpar International's superb ValFORTH environment.[CR]Bill Volk wrote a really amazing 3D library that really added a lot to the game's look and feel.[CR][B]jcooper, 06/03/2010[/B][CR]All, I found that if you make a copy of the construction disk or one of the game disks and rename it then it works. the emulator must have to think the disk is formatted as the old atari disks were. I am using the universe 1.3 dump with Atari Win800 version 4 and have been playing this great game for a number of days now.[CR]I hope that helps. This is all on a Windows XP system with Atari 800win emulation.[CR]Jerry[CR][B]mark harper, 11/02/2010[/B][CR]sorry, forgot to add my e-mail addy, it is[CR]univari@aol.com[CR]thanks for any help you can give me!![CR][B]Mark Harper, 11/02/2010[/B][CR]has anyone found a fix for the format error when trying to create a player disk? if so, please e-mail me. i loved this game years ago and would really enjoy being able to play it again!! Thanks!![CR][B]Bruce G, 11/10/2008[/B][CR]Does anyone have a guide on how to get this game started and working? I can get to the point of creating the player disk initally, and then it keeps saying that it can't format the disk. Any help is appreciated. Bruiser419@yahoo.com. Thanks![CR][B]Chris Edgar, 20/07/2008[/B][CR]Apologies for the double-comment.[CR]I should add: In fact, don't even really bother trying to play this game without reading my FAQ, which will be put up shortly. There are some serious and discouraging pitfalls, at least with the disk images out there.[CR]In fact, I truly wonder -- has ANYONE else out there actually been able to play the game fully? I have, for the record, but I have had to pull some tricks, such as occasionally using the FLIGHT disk from version 1.1 for space combat (because the FLIGHT disk for version 1.2 crashes in space combat). I'd be very interested to know, and to compare notes. And I REALLY want to get a hold of version 1.3 disk images, if anyone has them! Please upload them here if you do![CR][B]Chris Edgar, 20/07/2008[/B][CR]The sublight problem is caused by playing with SIO patching on. Universe doesn't handle that well in emulation. Turn it off, and use F7 (in Atari800Win, or whatever function in your emulator of choice) to speed up the whole emulation, rather than just the disk access, to get through disk loading times. Do it in short bursts, though, because you don't want game time to race by once it's loaded.[CR][B]Ben G, 29/03/2008[/B][CR]My brothers and I used to play this game back when it came out. We loved it, but the disks couldn't take all the swapping and eventually some went bad on us.[CR]Like Chad, I've managed to get the emulator all the way to the sublight drive menu. However I can actually do a planet scan and see the objects. But there the interface freezes and I cannot select objects or manually type in coordinates. What a shame. Kinda stuck without sublight manuevers.[CR]Also, I'm not sure how to set up the game so it knows the player disk is in drive 2.[CR]Anyone else have a solution for this? Thanks![CR][B]Chad Moody, 18/01/2007[/B][CR]Great game! I played this when I was 9 or 10.[CR]I've downloaded the files and played a bit but the screen always goes BLACK when I try to access the sublight drive. E-mail me if you can help. I'd love to play this fully again.[CR][B]Pete Wood, 21/11/2006[/B][CR]I Live in England and in 1984 when first released, this game would have cost £60! ($108 at todays rates) which was 2 weeks wages!!![CR]Have downloaded the rulkes and am preparing to play then ONE atari game i always wanted![CR][B]Chris Edgar, 02/09/2006[/B][CR]This is truly a great game, the likes of which have not since been seen. The main problem is getting over the learning curve and figuring out how to get a good game going without running out of fuel, provisions, money, etc. I'm working on a FAQ right now to make it smoother for others, and it'll be posted around the internet soon. So if you see this and are interested, search the internet for my name, universe and omnitrend, and you may run into it![CR][B]Marcos Olivares, 02/09/2005[/B][CR]I search 11 years! for this game, i remember me reading an ANALOG issue where it was reviewed, i was amazaed, I love this game. No game until now reach the level of complex space simulation, if you are a space adventurer THIS is your game, BUT READ the manual, is the key to all operations, god luck.</plot>

		<plot>[B]Jonny EOL, 07/04/2007[/B][CR]Hot-air ballooning isn't the most obvious topic for an action-packed game, but this sideways scroller is an interesting and challenging enough distraction. Plenty of obstacles to avoid and targets to hit for bonus points, plus management of one's fuel and sandbag resource made for a reasonable challenge.</plot>

More variety than most shoot-em-ups of the time, at least. [CR][B]Aegis, 16/06/2007[/B][CR]@Jim Kuchera: Umm... what version of Vanguard have you been playing? The original arcade machine was a single-screen cabinet as you can see at the Killer List Of Videogames:[CR]http://www.klov.com/game_detail.php?letter=V&amp;game;_id=10293[CR]The 5200/800/XL/XE version is actually a pretty good port of a fun game![CR][B]Jim Kuchera, 22/12/2006[/B][CR]The co-op version of this game was remarkable in that it was played on three monitors in width. It was a fantastic arcade game that took your breath away for its beauty. Though this 8-bit translation tries to render the game faithfully, it can't come close to the original arcade version. This game is not only available for the 5200, but the Atari 800/XL/XE group as well. I own it, but seldom play it though the musical score is worth listening too. Some games just can't be ported well because of the uniqueness of the original. Pass on this one.</plot>

I also love how smooth the animation is. I just wish that I could understand Polish - there's a lot of text and I'd love to be able to read it. The in-game graphics are just as good.[CR]Gameplay-wise, it's a bit like Fred for the C64. You have to get through a labyrinth of caves by climbing ropes and killing enemies.[CR]What's neat is that the music was written by the programmer, and both the game and the music are great.[CR][B]LS, 16/02/2007[/B][CR]Nice and long animated intro which tell us the story about viking warrior being thrown into the realm of the dead. Your task, naturally, is to get out of there. "Vicky" features fantastic music (with use of real samples) by Tomasz Liebich, one of the most impressive polish Atari musicians at the time.</plot>

		<plot>[B]VD Tonic, 19/06/2014[/B][CR]Very fast and stunning gameplay. Wish I would have had this back in the 80s. As your ship speeds up in the later levels the fun speeds up too. Feels almost like Musha Aleste on the Atari. Awesome Shoot'em Up.[CR][B]Auntie Pastie, 08/03/2008[/B][CR]The music and the parallax-effect title page alone are fantastic, but the game's pretty decent as well. Yes, the sprites are pretty chunky, but they're fast moving, the backgrounds are good, and the sound effects are noisy and satisfyingly "right" for a shoot-em-up. If there's a criticism it's that- minor changes in the waves aside- the gameplay can get a bit samey. But for £1.99 (just over £4 at 2008 prices), this was incredible value.[CR][B]steve, 26/07/2007[/B][CR]Intense fast shoot em up. Smooth too. Colourful if blocky. It is a good shoot em up if you get into it.Great music. One of the better shoot em ups on the atari[CR][B]Heaven, 04/04/2007[/B][CR]I have to dissagree... i played this game thousand times for highscore...you really get into the flow and shooting and shootihg etc... [CR]i love it...[CR][B]Byte, 07/08/2006[/B][CR]The game isn't really that good, but the Rob Hubbard soundtrack on the title screen is worth listening to.

Never made it far but always enjoyed playing.[CR][B]Daniel Thomas MacInnes, 09/05/2011[/B][CR]One of my favorite Galaxian shooters. Wavy Navy introduces just a few key changes to the formula - rolling waves, mines, kamikaze attacks - and the resulting game is always tough, tense, challenging. The terrific music deserves special mention; this is a great showcase for the legendary POKEY chip.</plot>

		<plot>[B]Jacob Hugart, 27/11/2008[/B][CR]It seems this is a .atx file; a copy-protected disk file. The Atari800MacX emulator for Mac OS X doesn't seem to handle this well. According to the documentation, it was a floppy; I can load the .atx file in to a floppy drive on that emulator, but a warm boot results in an error. Help?[CR][B]Lockett, 04/08/2008[/B][CR]Try an emulator. You can play the ORIGINAL version in Windows with one.[CR][B]ros, 30/10/2007[/B][CR]Although I haven't played Wayout in years, my ears still perk up when Pink Floyd plays the Cleptangle theme. Does anyone know how to open the Wayout download from the Atarimania page when using Windows? Does anyone know how to get the game in an updated format which will play on Windows?[CR]ros[CR][B]JSUK, 17/09/2007[/B][CR]Very advanced 3D for the time, with some complex gameplay features integrated. Variety in colours and designs on the levels would have helped (and been perfectly feasible, even allowing for processor/memory limits) but this is still an appealing and innovative game.[CR][B]Muffy St. Bernard, 30/04/2007[/B][CR]If the Cleptangle has stolen your map, go to a section of the maze with lots of dead ends. Then, when he arrives, follow him until he darts into a dead end, where he can be easily caught. Never bother chasing him down long corridors with no exits; he's faster than you. But if there are lots of exits around he often pauses briefly, allowing you to catch up.[CR]Also, if he's following you around, turn and take a few steps towards him; he'll run away.[CR]In a new maze, try to go all the way around the edge so you'll know the maze boundaries. Then start subdividing the different sections until you hear the "Wayout noise." Then you'll know where to focus (the comment that the exits are usually in the middle is false).[CR]When wind is coming out of the Wayout exit I have no idea how to force my way through. This is a problem with at least "Spiral" and "Sanctum.</plot>

		<plot>[B]Baz, 30/09/2013[/B][CR]This was one of my all time XL faves. I remember reading the Atari User review and it sounded pretty strange... they praised the character animation when the nurd turned round and that was a nifty piece of programming. The concept was bizarre but offered plenty of fun and some hair raising moments only to usually result in the nurd "melting" as it was killed once again! For a platformer, this had enough originality and humour for me.[CR][B]rastafarout, 16/07/2009[/B][CR]if you typed in "iamthehungrydude" in the title/game play you can leep to all levels...or it might meen extra lives...my feeble brain[CR][B]fog, 11/03/2008[/B][CR]I remember this game, as it was quite surreal. Also that it was a dual format tape.. one side was c64 and the other atari.[CR][B]Muffy St. Bernard, 15/09/2007[/B][CR]Fun, but the way you need to start levels over again after you die is maddening.</plot>

		<plot>[B]MalcolmM, 08/03/2010[/B][CR]Excellent game. Graphics are mediocre, but the playability is excellent. Two player co-operative is a blast. A friend and I played this for ages, we finally wrapped the game back around to the first dungeon.[CR][B]Jim Kuchera, 16/12/2006[/B][CR]Roklan Software had two fabulous titles---Wizard of Wor and Gorf. Both were among my favorite quarter-eaters, and these two transalations do not fail. Sound effects are identical to the arcade and add tremendously to the 'feel' of the orginal. I believe the maze in W of W is smaller than its big brother, but the game play is no less competitive. Lots of fun when played with a human teammate, but be careful you don't accidentally shoot him. He'll be ticked for killing his character, stomp out of the room, and then you'll have to kill all those baddies all by yourself. Serves you right!!!</plot>

One of the very first fighting games ever, this was great head-to-head or against the computer. The flying double-leg kick and the accompanying sound effect of your opponent taking them in the face was the most memorable moment, followed closely by getting a drop punch in the nards.</plot>

		<plot>[B]Jim Kuchera, 28/07/2007[/B][CR]A truly fine translation of the coin-op version, Xevious for the 8bit is a smooth scroller with excellent sound effects. A nicely packaged piece of fun waiting to be enjoyed. In the 'old days', we couldn't wait to get our hands on coin-op ports to our beloved Atari's. This one did not disappoint while others, such as Zaxxon and Galaxian, just didn't make the cut. Have fun saving the world on this game. Better on an 8bit Atari than through an emulator. That's my personal opinion, of course.</plot>

I cannot heap enough praise onto this masterpiece of a game. Beyond that, it's the first game to use enough of the Atari's special hardware, that the C=64 crowd has given up trying to port it.

		<plot>[B]Jim Kuchera, 13/02/2007[/B][CR]Zork was my first text adventure, and I was hooked. There's nothing like the first one you play, which will always be remembered as your 'first love'. To this day, I have the fondest memories of this wonderful challenge which made you think instead of react like so many 'quick jerk your joystick' games. You'll learn to type extremely fast with this game wanting to get from room to room, and manipulate the environment. Few people finish a game like this, but for those who do the satisfaction is immense. Truly this is one of the finest games ever written. It stands the test of time, and is worth yours.</plot>

		<plot>[B]maggi71, 14/01/2013[/B][CR]The music gets annoying the longer you play this game (just press the s-key to stop the sound) but the different screens and the puzzles are fantastic.[CR]There is a bit of a twist when you get to the catacombs and thats the reason why most of the players never finished the game.[CR]When you learned how to manage these screens they were very easy to handle.[CR]The disk version has more screens than the cassette version so should go with the first one.[CR]I still love this game even it's not as addictive as Bruce Lee (also from Datasoft). [CR]Great title![CR][B]Larry Gill, 16/04/2012[/B][CR]I remember playing this game for hours with my kids, I am now 62. This was a great game, and we finally got to the final screen and rescued the girl.[CR]I wish I could play this on my Macbook Pro.[CR][B]steve, 10/10/2008[/B][CR]Nearly 25 years after it's release and I have finally managed to complete this beast. I could never get past the catatomb cave area![CR]Great graphics and sound with incredibly depth to the game play. It certainly gets you thinking out the puzzles. Not as frustrating as 'Goonies' and not quite as addictive as the great 'Bruce Lee' - Another superb release from Datasoft. [CR][B]Pablo Mancilla, 05/10/2007[/B][CR]You are right Andy, the disk version have more screens, the tape version is not full. I'm trapped on the catacomb area, but I remember about 10+ years ago finding the soldier's lair where you must rescue the girl evading cannon shots..[CR][B]danny-uk, 13/11/2006[/B][CR]I have fond memories of playing this game for hours with my sister, at the tender age of 7![CR][B]PS Wallace, 08/02/2006[/B][CR]I remember buying this game when it first came out in 1986. Really cool game for its time.[CR][B]Andy Bernstein, 29/05/2004[/B][CR]It should be noted that the disk version (multi-loader) contains more screens than the tape release which is a single load and is thus limited to 64ko.</plot>

		<plot>[B]Jason, 22/06/2013[/B][CR]Loved this game and the music.[CR][B]Peter, 04/07/2012[/B][CR]Greatest game ever on the Atari, wipes the floor with any Spectrum or Amstrad shoot em' up! Many happy memories playing this game with my brother.[CR][B]ciddibiri, 11/08/2011[/B][CR]1988-89-90 senelerinde ailecek (3 kardes) ve hatta dayim da katilirdi bize oynardik. Halen bu oyundaki tadi aldigim bir oyuna rastlamadim. Oyun zorluk olarak da 10 üzerinden 8 alir herhalde. Ben ve kardesim oyunu defalarca bitirmistik.[CR][B]Andreas Koch, 15/02/2011[/B][CR]Small Sidenote:[CR]There exists a "Zybex" tape with a cover that has different screen shots than this one (but maybe this cover with alt. screenshots is not so common as the one shown here)...[CR][B]Gruppenfuhrer WOLF, 15/09/2010[/B][CR]Excellent game! We played like crazy with my brother with two players. Unforgettable.[CR][B]Carlos, 31/01/2010[/B][CR]Amazing game in ALL the aspect.[CR]Long live to Atari800 and 130!![CR][B]mrots, 28/05/2009[/B][CR]oh zybex no moim zdaniem hyba najlepsza strzelanka na atrynke rzeby jom ukonczyc gralem tak dlugo ze wiedzialem gdzie wyleci jaka bron lub dodatkowe zycia[CR][B]Auntie Pastie, 08/03/2008[/B][CR]Nicely-done shoot-'em-up; although I initially thought this had been overrated by the computer mags, it turned out to have enough variety and balance of difficulty to keep you playing to the end.[CR]The ending itself was pretty disappointing to be honest, but who cares? The game's the thing![CR][B]Jonny EOL, 11/11/2006[/B][CR]Top-class shooter from Zeppelin. Great music, great graphics, great weapons, great aliens - in fact great pretty-much everything. I even completed it once! [CR][B]BrunoN, 30/05/2004[/B][CR]Ace! Five nice weapons, cool graphics and dynamics makes it best and most playable shootem-up on Atari. Oh yeah, I forgot about music - Adam Gilmore rules.</plot>
