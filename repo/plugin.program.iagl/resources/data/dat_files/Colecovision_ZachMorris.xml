		<plot>As a result of events never seen in 2010: The Year We Make Contact, Discovery is on a collision course with one of Jupiter's moons, and as an engineer aboard the craft, it's up to you to make the needed repairs before the imminent impact.Using a shipboard repair drone dubbed 'WALDO', you must repair the Life-Support, Engine, Communications, Reactor, and HAL Circuits(CITs), by first placing WALDO upon the CIT in question, and scroll through three different pattern screens on the WALDO's readout. By matching the correct screen to the right circuit, you repair the circuit. From there, you guide the power from the left side of the screen, through each CIT and completing the power flow to the exit circuit other end of the screen. As you do this, a Magnetic Flux field can overload CITs, requiring you to perform additional repairs on them, so it is in the player's best interest to guide the power as quickly as possible.The game closely resembles Electrical Circuit Board Game (1974) designed by Teruo Matsumoto, and this type of puzzle is still is use today, for example the hacking in Bioshock. What 2010 does is add a sense of haste and an additional level of gameplay though the Magnetic Flux Field which moves across the screen quickly and can force you to start the stage from scratch when it blows a circuit.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Antarctic Adventure is a multiplatform game developed by Konami during the early days of video games (1983). The game puts the player in control of a Penguin, Penta, as he races to various research stations in Antarctica, owned by different countries.Gameplay is a pseudo 3D trek through the Antartica snow fields, where the player must avoid sea lions and gaps in the ice as they make their way to the next station within a time limit. Fish jumping from holes in the ice can be collected for bonus points. There is no ending, and after completion of the game, the player will start the game again, this time with an increased difficulty level.Moving left and right, slowing the peguins speed, and jumping are used to traverse obstacles. Collecting a flashing flag will give Penta a propellor that can be used to fly over obstaclesAntarctic Adventure led to its sequel, Penguin Adventure, a more fleshed out affair. Success of the series led to the use of Penta and his son Pentarou as Konami Mascots during the 1980s.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>In this two player game each player controls an artillery gun set in a mountain landscape with the goal of destroying the other player. Players take turns firing at each other; on each turn you have a limited amount of time in which the barrel angle and powder level can be set in order to control the direction and distance of the shot. When deciding on your shot, you will need to take the current conditions into account, which includes wind speed/direction and any mountains that may get in your way. Successfully destroying your opponents gun will earn you a point, and the first player to reach the set number of points wins the game. There are multiple skill levels available which set the amount of time you have to make a shot.</plot>

		<plot>A vast beam matrix has enshrouded the Earth. This glowing blue grid forms the Restrictor Shield, 99 sectors deep and teeming with hostile alien life. Your mission is to move through all sectors, destroying the enemy craft as you progress. Deeper sectors reveal new enemy types, each with their own method of impeding your success.The player's ship can only move left and right, travelling along one of five beams as the blue beam matrix scrolls towards them. The ship is armed a laser lariat and torpedoes, with the laser being the principle weapon. When the fire button is pressed, the laser will shoot along the beam the player is currently on. The main aim is to destroy all white saucers in a sector, causing the Sector Sentinel to appear. This can only be destroyed with a torpedo &#8211; three are given to the player at the start of each sector &#8211; and a successful hit awards bonus points before play progresses to the next sector.  [CR][B]Enemies:[/B][CR]  White Enemy Saucers      These are the main enemies you'll encounter. There are 15 in each sector, and you'll need to blast every one of them before you can progress. Saucers change up their attack pattern every few sectors e.g. dodging from left to right while spewing a string of bombs, or simply flying towards your ship in an attempt to ram you. Once you've destroyed all of the saucers in a sector a Sentinel craft will appear, giving you a chance to destroy it. Saucers appear from Sector 1.  Brown Space Debris      This rock-hard refuse will fly in a straight line down a beam at you. Normal laser fire will not damage it, so it can be avoided or destroyed with one of the three torpedoes you are given at the start of each life. Space debris starts appearing from Sector 2 onwards.    Yellow Chirper Ships      These mouthy aliens will announce their arrival with a twin-trill alert. They will then fly horizontally from one side of the screen to the other. Chirpers do not fire at your ship, and cannot collide with it. As such, they serve merely to provide bonus points for any player with a quick trigger finger. Chirpers start appearing from Sector 4.  Green Blocker Ships         Nigh-indestructible enemies that will streak in from the side of the screen, locking onto the beam that your ship is travelling down before trying to ram you. They must then either be avoided or destroyed with a torpedo, as they are impervious to regular laser fire. Although blockers can appear while clearing a sector of white saucers, they predominantly show up to protect a Sector Sentinel. On later levels, more and more green blockers will assault your craft, attempting to thwart any effort to blow up the Sentinel by blocking your torpedoes and causing you to switch beams to get a clear shot. Blockers start appearing as regular enemies from Sector 6.  Green Bounce Craft      This rotund enemy comes from the side of the screen and bounces horizontally across from one beam to the next, hoping to land on your ship to destroy it. If it is unsuccessful, it will bounce off the opposite side of the screen to return at another random interval. Regular lasers cannot harm it, so shoot it with a torpedo or try not to be on the beam it bounces on. Green bouncers appear from Sector 7.Blue Chargers      Chargers will zip down the screen at you along a random beam. They have two methods of attack, depending on what beam your ship is travelling on. If you're on the same beam as a charger when it reaches the bottom of the screen, it will collide with your ship and destroy it. If you're not on the same beam, the charger will wait for a few seconds before leaving the screen. During this small pause there is a chance that you will move sideways and onto the beam where the stationary charger is lurking, resulting in your death. While they aren't actually destroyed by your laser, firing a quick shot up the beam will cause a charger to bounce backwards into the distance from where it came. Chargers begin to appear from Sector 10.Orange Trackers      These devilish ships will track onto the beam your ship is flying along and attempt to ram you. Unlike green blockers, however, trackers will change beams to follow you should you try to avoid them. Initially, they will only change beam once to try and cause a collision. However, the further into the beam matrix you travel, the more intent the trackers will become; soon they will start to change course two or more times in their efforts. Additionally, they are invulnerable to common laser fire, meaning you'll need to be fast to avoid them or see them off with one of your precious torpedoes. Trackers start appearing at Sector 12.Red Zig Bombs      The final enemy to appear is one of the trickiest. Like the chirper, a Zig bomb will make a sound before making its way onscreen. When it does, it will find the beam your ship is on and start to come towards you. Zig bombs cannot be killed outright with regular laser fire, but they can be handled in various ways. If you manage to shoot a Zig bomb with your laser, it will change from red to green. It will then continue its flight down the beam it has chosen, before disappearing off the bottom of the screen. If, for whatever reason, you don't shoot the Zig bomb, it will travel down the beam before performing a last-minute flip across one beam towards your ship. This means if you fail to shoot the Zig, you should ensure that you are at least two beams away from it before it leaves the screen. Of course, the third method of taking a Zig out is to blast it with a torpedo. Zig bombs will appear from Sector 14 onwards.Sector Sentinel      Once all of the white saucers in a sector have been eliminated, an alarm will sound. The Sector Sentinel will then slide into view from either side of the screen. It will continue across the beam matrix horizon until it is either destroyed or leaves on the side opposite its starting position. During its migration, you can attempt to bring it down with any torpedoes you have in your stock. The higher the sector number, the more green blockers will flood onto the screen to prevent the Sentinel from being destroyed. A successful hit will cause the Sentinel to explode and bonus points are given depending on the number of lives you have accrued. Whether or not you destroy a Sentinel, the sector has been cleared and you move onto the next one. [CR]</plot>

		<title_clean>Boulder Dash</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Boulder Dash is a maze game with added gravity. Players control Rockford, a stick man who navigates a series of caverns filled with Earth, boulders, diamonds and a series of creatures who kill on touch. The concept is simple: collect enough diamonds to escape each level within a time limit. But while Rockford isn't affected by gravity, the boulders and diamonds are -- remove a piece of earth underneath a boulder and it will fall, often setting off a chain reaction of falling debris. So the game plays as a puzzle game; with each move that the player makes, they have to anticipate the consequences.Boulder Dash is one of a very short list of titles that began on home machines that were later transferred to the arcades. In 2006, Atari2600.com developed an Atari 5200 version of the game in conjunction with First Star Software. One iteration of the game was released in 2007 by ZX Games, and is a largely faithful remake of the original over 20 years after its original release. In 2009, a flash-based Browser version was released, sporting updated graphics.Virtual ConsoleThe Commodore 64 version of Boulder Dash was released on to the Wii Virtual Console on June 1st 2009 for 500 Wii Points.[CR]</plot>

By keeping track of either the tones generated or the colors flashing, the player can copy the sequence to continue. Higher difficulties increase speed and allow only tone identification of sequences. Additionally it keeps track of your best number of correct identifications in a row.[CR]The second game is "Clef Climber" where the player is given a tone that corresponds to a certain musical note and must match the note being played. Lower difficulties provide a constant tone to refer to and visual help on the note being used. Higher difficulties provide a single playing of the tone and no visual help.</plot>

		<title_clean>Bump 'N' Jump</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Bump 'N' Jump started as an arcade game developed by Data East, which was licensed to Bally Midway for its use in 1982. Its popularity spawned several console ports, the last being an NES version in 1988.In Bump 'N' Jump, players drive a red car down an open road at up to 220 MPH (or km/h in some versions). The main objective is to reach the gas station at the end of each roadway without crashing into obstacles, trees, or water. The road is filled with traffic of both light and heavy cars and trucks, some of which attempt to take the player's car out by bumping into it and sending it skidding to the side. Points are earned for progress made down the road, as well as bumping into other cars and sending them skidding off the road or into obstacles.A warning sign to jump. Jump! Once the player's car reaches 100 MPH, the car can jump high into the air. Around 40-50 MPH in speed will be lost by a single jump, so players will need to use some strategy to decide when it is most advantageous to utilize jumping. Jumping can come in handy to avoid skidding off the road when bumped, and also for avoiding patches of heavy traffic. Landing on enemy cars will destroy them and earn points.Countless broken bridges, water, slight curves, and splits also pose problems along the road. Well-timed jumps are often the only way to clear some obstacles such as broken bridges, and also are the easiest way to clear most water hazards. Because timing is essential for clearing major hazards, a warning beep sounds and a "!" will appear at the top of the screen when a hazard requiring a jump is imminent (though some hazards may still have safe causeways on one side). Landing on islands in the middle of water or bridge hazards will earn bonus points.At the end of a roadway, the number of enemy cars taken out is added to the player's score as bonus points, usually 300 to 500 points per car. In the event no enemies were crashed during the roadway, a significantly large bonus of 50,000 points will be awarded.As with most retro games, the game ends once the player exhausts all their lives.[CR][B]Levels:[/B][CR]Roadways in Bump 'N' Jump are based off seasons. Once a player completes the first roadway, they start a Spring stage, then progress to a Summer stage, and so on, moving and repeating through all the seasons. The colors in these stages reflect their represented season, and offer little other change beyond increasing difficulty.The variation of roadways varies between versions. In the arcade version, after the first three roads, the game begins a cycle of five roadways in order, repeating indefinitely until game over. The Intellivision version claims to have 32 unique roadways, while the Atari 2600 version has only eight (perhaps in the same manner as the arcade version).[CR][B]Enemies:[/B][CR]Differentiating every type of enemy car can be difficult, especially in console versions with lower detailed graphics. For the sake of simplicity, it is best to assume that any cars not mentioned here are light, may weave back and forth on the road in a non-hostile manner, and will skid a long way if hit.The more important cars to watch for are listed below.TractorThe tractor is often mistaken as a tank by players, as it has large treads and a dark green appearance in some console versions. The tractor drives in a straight line, and is extremely slow and easy to pass. Bumping a heavy tractor will barely budge it, and will send the player skidding further than usual. For this reason, caution should be used when passing tractors on narrow sections of road.Skull CarOne skull car and two dump trucks.The skull car is obvious in appearance, as it has a large skull and crossbones on its roof. When the players gets near a skull car, it will usually move toward the player, attempting to bump them off the road and generally get in the way. While this is far more dangerous in writing than in practice, poorly-timed encounters with a skull car can cause bumping that slows a player down at a crucial moment, ruining a necessary jump. The same warning applies to narrow roads and splits, especially when trying to navigate around other vehicles.Dump TruckArguably the most dangerous enemy in the game, the dump truck often moves faster than the player's top speed, and will dump out piles of debris that can crash the player if hit. Dump trucks only move in a straight line, and often must be watched closely while engaging other traffic. Simply touching a dump truck will destroy it -- an important fact to keep in mind if shooting for the 50,000 point no-kill bonus.During the first roadway, and select seasons afterwards (depending on version), the dump truck will make its dumping animation, but won't actually dump any debris onto the road.White CarThe white car is not as aggressive as the skull car, but will move towards the player and attempt to interfere upon approach. As with the skull car, care must be taken to avoid letting the white car botch jump speed and timing.Yellow TruckIn more graphically detailed versions, this truck may be blue with a yellow front. Otherwise, it looks like a pure yellow heavy-duty dump truck. The yellow truck is appropriately heavy, much like the tractor, but also weaves across the road frequently, making it tougher to simply dodge.[CR][B]Difficulty:[/B][CR]While Bump 'N' Jump is not a difficult game to learn by any means, its difficulty varies from system to system. Successfully completing roadways often necessitates rote memorization, as the top-down view makes knowledge of upcoming splits and twists in hazards impossible. This is especially true in later stages, where the player may be required to time landings on small islands in the middle of hazards before jumping again, without knowing what speed is necessary to hit the island.Some versions of the game are also stingy in handing out lives. The Intellivision version only explicitly promises one extra life at 20,000 points, and makes no mention of other opportunities for extra lives. In the arcade and Atari 2600 versions, where extra lives are awarded every 30,000 points, the best way to maintain a healthy supply of lives is by earning the 50,000 no-kill bonus as often as possible.[CR]NES version[CR]The NES version of Bump 'N' Jump came out in 1988, far later than earlier versions, and exhibits significant differences over its predecessors in both difficulty and storyline.A plot is added in which the protagonist's girlfriend has been kidnapped by generic thugs, who he pursues over 16 stages. The seasons concept is thrown out for a more diversely themed set of stages, featuring cityscapes, beaches, and cliffsides. Some stages also contain bonus air targets, which can be hit at the peak of a jump.The difficulty for this version is also much higher, with only three lives available to start and very high score thresholds to attain extra lives. In addition, P-fuel cells need to be gathered along the road, in order to keep a rapidly-depleting fuel tank full. Running out of fuel costs a life, which makes the process of surviving all the more bothersome. A few recharge stations can be entered in certain stages throughout the game, which starts a lengthy button mashing bonus sequence to regain P-fuel.Upon reaching the end of stage 16, the player engages in a boss fight with the enemy car carrying his girlfriend. Running out of P-fuel here does not kill the player, but renders them unable to jump regardless of speed. After the boss is jumped on enough times and destroyed, a cutscene plays, and the 16 stages begin all over again.[CR]</plot>

Once the player's car reaches 100 MPH, the car can jump high into the air. Around 40-50 MPH in speed will be lost by a single jump, so players will need to use some strategy to decide when it is most advantageous to utilize jumping. Jumping can come in handy to avoid skidding off the road when bumped, and also for avoiding patches of heavy traffic. Landing on enemy cars will destroy them and earn points.Countless broken bridges, water, slight curves, and splits also pose problems along the road. Well-timed jumps are often the only way to clear some obstacles such as broken bridges, and also are the easiest way to clear most water hazards. Because timing is essential for clearing major hazards, a warning beep sounds and a "!" will appear at the top of the screen when a hazard requiring a jump is imminent (though some hazards may still have safe causeways on one side). Landing on islands in the middle of water or bridge hazards will earn bonus points.At the end of a roadway, the number of enemy cars taken out is added to the player's score as bonus points, usually 300 to 500 points per car. In the event no enemies were crashed during the roadway, a significantly large bonus of 50,000 points will be awarded.As with most retro games, the game ends once the player exhausts all their lives.[CR][B]Levels:[/B][CR]Roadways in Bump 'N' Jump are based off seasons. Once a player completes the first roadway, they start a Spring stage, then progress to a Summer stage, and so on, moving and repeating through all the seasons. The colors in these stages reflect their represented season, and offer little other change beyond increasing difficulty.The variation of roadways varies between versions. In the arcade version, after the first three roads, the game begins a cycle of five roadways in order, repeating indefinitely until game over. The Intellivision version claims to have 32 unique roadways, while the Atari 2600 version has only eight (perhaps in the same manner as the arcade version).[CR][B]Enemies:[/B][CR]Differentiating every type of enemy car can be difficult, especially in console versions with lower detailed graphics. For the sake of simplicity, it is best to assume that any cars not mentioned here are light, may weave back and forth on the road in a non-hostile manner, and will skid a long way if hit.The more important cars to watch for are listed below.TractorThe tractor is often mistaken as a tank by players, as it has large treads and a dark green appearance in some console versions. The tractor drives in a straight line, and is extremely slow and easy to pass. Bumping a heavy tractor will barely budge it, and will send the player skidding further than usual. For this reason, caution should be used when passing tractors on narrow sections of road.Skull CarOne skull car and two dump trucks.The skull car is obvious in appearance, as it has a large skull and crossbones on its roof. When the players gets near a skull car, it will usually move toward the player, attempting to bump them off the road and generally get in the way. While this is far more dangerous in writing than in practice, poorly-timed encounters with a skull car can cause bumping that slows a player down at a crucial moment, ruining a necessary jump. The same warning applies to narrow roads and splits, especially when trying to navigate around other vehicles.Dump TruckArguably the most dangerous enemy in the game, the dump truck often moves faster than the player's top speed, and will dump out piles of debris that can crash the player if hit. Dump trucks only move in a straight line, and often must be watched closely while engaging other traffic. Simply touching a dump truck will destroy it -- an important fact to keep in mind if shooting for the 50,000 point no-kill bonus.During the first roadway, and select seasons afterwards (depending on version), the dump truck will make its dumping animation, but won't actually dump any debris onto the road.White CarThe white car is not as aggressive as the skull car, but will move towards the player and attempt to interfere upon approach. As with the skull car, care must be taken to avoid letting the white car botch jump speed and timing.Yellow TruckIn more graphically detailed versions, this truck may be blue with a yellow front. Otherwise, it looks like a pure yellow heavy-duty dump truck. The yellow truck is appropriately heavy, much like the tractor, but also weaves across the road frequently, making it tougher to simply dodge.[CR][B]Difficulty:[/B][CR]While Bump 'N' Jump is not a difficult game to learn by any means, its difficulty varies from system to system. Successfully completing roadways often necessitates rote memorization, as the top-down view makes knowledge of upcoming splits and twists in hazards impossible. This is especially true in later stages, where the player may be required to time landings on small islands in the middle of hazards before jumping again, without knowing what speed is necessary to hit the island.Some versions of the game are also stingy in handing out lives. The Intellivision version only explicitly promises one extra life at 20,000 points, and makes no mention of other opportunities for extra lives. In the arcade and Atari 2600 versions, where extra lives are awarded every 30,000 points, the best way to maintain a healthy supply of lives is by earning the 50,000 no-kill bonus as often as possible.[CR]NES version[CR]The NES version of Bump 'N' Jump came out in 1988, far later than earlier versions, and exhibits significant differences over its predecessors in both difficulty and storyline.A plot is added in which the protagonist's girlfriend has been kidnapped by generic thugs, who he pursues over 16 stages. The seasons concept is thrown out for a more diversely themed set of stages, featuring cityscapes, beaches, and cliffsides. Some stages also contain bonus air targets, which can be hit at the peak of a jump.The difficulty for this version is also much higher, with only three lives available to start and very high score thresholds to attain extra lives. In addition, P-fuel cells need to be gathered along the road, in order to keep a rapidly-depleting fuel tank full. Running out of fuel costs a life, which makes the process of surviving all the more bothersome. A few recharge stations can be entered in certain stages throughout the game, which starts a lengthy button mashing bonus sequence to regain P-fuel.Upon reaching the end of stage 16, the player engages in a boss fight with the enemy car carrying his girlfriend. Running out of P-fuel here does not kill the player, but renders them unable to jump regardless of speed. After the boss is jumped on enough times and destroyed, a cutscene plays, and the 16 stages begin all over again.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The Title screen.Burgertime is an Arcade game originally released in 1982. A single-screen platformer game, the stages are a series of platforms with sections that are made of components of a mighty hamburger. These ingredients are placed in the level vertically so that, as the player character walked across them, they would drop until eventually making a complete sandwich at the bottom of the screen. The finished burgers are such titans that it dwarfs the player character. Of note, the servers who would carry this burger to the customers are never shown.The player controls Peter Pepper, a chef whose objective is to walk, climb and scurry all over the platforms in order to build his burgers. As the chef walks completely across the top of a layer, it will drops one level below, thus knocking the layer beneath down one level also. After all the layers have been dropped onto the platters awaiting below, the burger is complete and the player's score is boosted. When all hamburgers are completed, only then is the level clear. As with most of the games of the time, the levels become more complex and difficult as the player progresses. This is accomplished through varied platform layouts, more enemies, and an ever-increasing number of burger components. Just like in real life, no-one orders a plain cheeseburger forever. While the chef fights to keep his customers fed and happy, he is besieged by three malcontents of the food industry: Mr. Hot Dog, Mr. Pickle and Mr. Egg. These 3 can be killed temporarily by dropping a layer of the burger on top of them but it is a short-term solution as they reappear at the edge of the screen after a short time. A crafty chef can also make the fiends chase him across a partially walked across layer and then complete it as the enemy steps on to it. The layer will then drop along with the enemy whose weight causes it to drop two levels as opposed to just one. An added benefit to this technique is that it temporarily stuns the enemy. It's possible to crush other enemies beneath the falling enemy and burger as well. Peter Pepper also has a small supply of pepper he can throw in the enemies face to render them harmless for a few seconds. Additional pepper can be acquired by picking up ice cream and other items that will randomly spawn on the level.PizzaTime, the hotly anticipated sequel was in development when the video game market went into a decline, and sadly was never released.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] 50,000 Points[CR]To get a bonus of 50K points, get Game Over then at the title screen press Keypad 1, then 3, then 7, then the Joystick Button.

		<plot>In Centipede, the player is trapped in the Enchanted Forest. Armed with only a magic wand to ward off the forest's insect denizens, all of which apparently are attacking in the player in continuous waves. [CR]The player must use the magic wand to shoot sparks at approaching insects to score points by pressing the controller button. Holding down the controller button will set the wand to rapid fire shots. If the player is bitten by an insect, the player will be temporarily paralyzed and lose one of the three starting magic wands. [CR]Insect Opponents and Mushrooms[CR]All enemy insects have a distinctive sound before attacking, which may help the player identify which insect is attacking. Enemies and objects in the game are as the following:[CR]1. The Centipede[CR]The Centipede will attack in 12 waves. In the first wave, the Centipede will have a head attached to 11 body segments. In the second wave, the Centipede will have a head attached to 10 body segments, in addition to a detached head. The third wave will have the Centipede with an attached head, 9 body segments, plus two detached heads. These body segments will transform into heads and continue to do so until Wave 12. In the last wave, the Centipede will have 12 detached heads, independently attacking the player. Centipede heads are worth more points than body segments.[CR]Attacks from the Centipede will come from the top of the screen, moving downward. If a spark hits any part of the Centipede, that particular body segment will transform into a mushroom, while the body segment behind it will become the new Centipede head.

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Choplifter is a side-scrolling action game in which the player controls a helicopter that must elude the various enemy military forces trying to shoot it down while rescuing prisoners. It debuted on the Apple-II home computer in 1982 before being ported or adapted for a number of other home computers and consoles throughout the 1980s. It also saw multiple sequels.One of the earliest video games to have an  exclaimed! title. While the original game and early licensed ports of Choplifter! have an exclamation point on the box art and/or title screen, later ports (notably Sega's) omitted it and subsequent games in the series followed suit.[CR]</plot>

		<title_clean>Chuck Norris - Super Kicks</title_clean>
		<plot>In this action game you play the part of Chuck Norris on a quest to reach a monastery where an important leader is kept hostage. The game consists of several different screens: when beginning and between fights you will see a view of the path that leads to the monastery. Walking along the path, you will encounter numerous enemies. When fighting, the view switches to a close up of your current location. By pressing the joystick button and moving the joystick in one of four directions you can perform various kicks, punches, and blocks. The enemies you encounter are varied, and some can only be defeated by certain moves. The path you walk along will occasionally split up into two or more choices; when this happens, only one choice is correct and the others are dead ends. If you choose incorrectly, you'll have to back track a bit and try again. Beginning as a white belt, you will slowly increase in rank as you win fights. By the time you reach the monastery you need to earn black belt status in order to defeat the deadly ninjas inside! Your quest must be completed within a time limit, or the game is over. Walking off of the path or losing fights will also cause you to lose even more time.</plot>

It never found the success of Donkey Kong and Frogger, and it was very much a commercial failure. Despite its lack of success in the arcades, it was eventually ported to most home computers and game home consoles.     [CR][B]Story:[/B][CR] Bongo is a mischievous ape that sets the tent of safari hunter on fire. The safari hunter lost his tent and possessions, and he seeks revenge on the ape for his practical joke. The safari hunter chases Bongo and through the dangerous Congo to get his revenge. [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] [CR] Rhinos, one of the many dangers in the CongoCongo Bongo takes place in an isometric perspective, and requires the player to move a safari hunter through for different levels. One level, that resembles Donkey Kong, has the hunter climbing a mountain while simultaneously avoiding coconuts that a gorilla is hurling its way. Two levels have that hunter moving through a level avoiding hippos and rhinos. The last level very much resembles frogger, and has the hunter crossing a river across logs and lily pads.  These four levels will loop until the player loses all their lives.[CR]</plot>

		<title_clean>Cosmic Avenger</title_clean>
		<plot>While originally an arcade release, it stands among a number of otherwise obscure Universal titles that gained larger exposure thanks to being exclusively ported to the ColecoVision.  As with Scramble, it is an example of a very early side scrolling shooter, in which the player's craft flies over moving terrain. Missile bases, roving tanks and static bases offer targets for the player's bombs, while submarines and enemy ships (which look not unlike Star Wars' Tie-Fighters) are best dealt with standard laser shots.  There are three primary zones that must be crossed; a futuristic cityscape, a largely flat plane, and an underwater cavern.  These scenes loop endlessly, with the primary goal of the game aimed at achieving the highest score from destroying targets. A radar screen at the top is suggestive of Defender, but the player does not have the same freedom of movement as in that title.  Moving the joystick backwards or forwards does affect the speed at which the terrain scrolls, giving the player a level of throttle control.  Unlike Scramble, there is no concern for a dwindling fuel meter, but the player is limited to a single bomb or laser pellet on the screen at once.   While colorful and competent, the somewhat choppy movement of the landscape betrayed an inherent limitation of the ColecoVision hardware with regards to displaying scrolling backgrounds.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Defender is a  side scrolling shoot 'em up, and one one of the first space shooters to feature the freedom to move left or right. Gameplay[CR]The player flies left or right looking for UFOs to shoot. An HUD located on the top of the screen indicates where the UFOs are located; the goal is to achieve as many points as possible.Defender has a wrap-around landscape, and that landscape contains as many as ten humanoids. Alien ships called Landers attempt to abduct these humanoids. If a Lander grabs a humanoid and carries it up to the top of the screen, the Lander and humanoid merge into a much more aggressive Mutant ship. If all of the humanoids are killed, the land at the bottom of the screen explodes and the player must fight in empty space. At this point, all the Landers become Mutants. Every fifth wave restores the humanoid count to ten, regenerating the planetary surface, if necessary.Defender had a fairly complicated control scheme for the time, with a lever for moving up and down and buttons for thrust, fire, reverse, smart bomb, and hyperspace. Most ports and even some emulated versions of Defender replace the thrust and reverse buttons in favor of a four-way joystick to control movement and direction.The game was programmed by  Eugene Jarvis and  Larry DeMar, who would later go on to form an external development company known as Vid Kidz.[CR]</plot>

		<title_clean>Donkey Kong</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The First LevelThe arcade classic Donkey Kong rose out of Nintendo's desire to crack into the United States arcade market. The company's president back in 1981, Hiroshi Yamauchi, made the decision to take a Nintendo arcade release called Radar Scope (a hit game in Japan that floundered in the States) and see if it could be easily retrofitted to play a different, and hopefully more successful, game. To accomplish this task, Yamauchi chose a young employee named Shigeru Miyamoto.The basic story of the game is that Donkey Kong is Jumpman's pet. Jumpman mistreats Donkey Kong, who snaps and kidnaps Pauline and, in a decidedly King Kong-like twist, takes her up a building under construction. Jumpman must navigate four different levels, climbing to the top to either force Donkey Kong to move on or, in the stunning final confrontation, bring the building's girders down to make the big monkey fall.Donkey Kong was followed-up by Donkey Kong Jr. , which puts the player in the role of Donkey Kong's son, Donkey Kong Jr., who must attempt to rescue his father from the clutches of the evil Jumpman, who by then had already been renamed Mario. [CR]Development[CR]The Second LevelUpon going to work, Miyamoto's first attempt was to make a game based on the then-popular Popeye character. The licensing deal was not pursued by Nintendo, though the company would later secure the license and develop a popular Popeye arcade game. Miyamoto had to retrofit his concept and develop three characters with similar relations to Popeye, Olive Oyl, and Bluto. He came up with a little man with a mustache that was quickly named Jumpman, who had to save his girlfriend, Pauline, from the evil gorilla named Donkey Kong. After designing the concept Miyamoto approached his more colleague Gunpei Yokoi who would assist the young designer by supervising the technical development of the project.Unfortunately due to the technical limitations in place not all of Miyamoto's ideas for the game were able to be included as concepts such as incorporating seesaws into the game or having the characters expressions more defined and animated were unable to be incremented into the game. These technical restrictions would ultimately have an effect on the character design of Jumpman as he was forced to make the character small whilst still making him look human. As such Miyamoto thought it best to give the character distinct features,"such as giving him a big nose. We gave him a moustache so that we didn't need to draw a mouth, as it's often difficult to show facial expressions with small characters. We also gave him big hands."The name Donkey Kong was ultimately the decision of Miyamoto too. Wanting to give the impression of a stubborn, stupid gorilla he thought of animals which he thought were dim-witted and stubborn he came up with the idea of 'Donkey' which he believed to mean stupid. He also wished to incorporate the word 'Kong' into the title which in Japanese gives the idea of apes. Putting the two together the end result was "Donkey Kong". [CR][B]Legacy:[/B][CR]The Final LevelDonkey Kong helped to create the platformer genre, and also was one of the first to include a story. Donkey Kong changed the way people played games; no longer was it just about high scores, gamers began to play the game to find out what would happen next. Donkey Kong became one of the most iconic video games of all-time and a huge part of American pop culture, gaining mentions on countless television shows, songs, and movies. Donkey Kong also essentially launched Nintendo's biggest character of all-time, Mario.As a testament to the legacy of Donkey Kong, the documetary King of Kong: A Fistful of Quarters was released in 2007, 26 years after the game's debut. The film was about gamer Steve Wiebe and his journey to defeat Billy Mitchell's high score, which had stood for 25 years. Public awareness about the competition for this score was raised by this film, and in the years since Wiebe, Mitchell, and others have traded positions on the top spot. Read more about the documentary at the official site.In July 2009, Donkey Kong made news yet again when a 26-year-old easter egg, which did nothing more than display the initials of Landon M. Dyer, who worked to code the title, was uncovered after Dyer mentioned that he had forgotten how to display the initials and offered $75 to whomever can find the Easter egg first. The $75 was awarded to Don Hodges after he dug through the game's code and found the way to display the initials.[CR]Donkey Kong: Original Edition[CR]In 2010, a special version of the NES release of Donkey Kong was available to those in Europe who purchased the special Super Mario Bros. 25th anniversary Wii. This version, subtitled "Original Edition", restored the missing "pie factory" stage as well as some animations. Although still not arcade-perfect, it was still much more than any edition released on the NES.This edition of the game would not release in Japan or the United States until 2012, and only then, on the 3DS. In Japan, it was a pre-order bonus for New Super Mario Bros. 2. In The States, it is a bonus gift for players that purchase the digital download versions of Art Academy: Lessons For Everyone!, Paper Mario: Sticker Star, Professor Layton and the Miracle Mask, Style Savvy: Trendsetters, or Crosswords Plus before January 6, 2013. It was made available to everyone for purchase on the European 3DS eShop on September 18, 2014.[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]The first console port was licensed by Nintendo but not made by them. A near perfect arcade port, and pack-in, was created for the ColecoVision system. This propelled its sales over the Atari 5200 and sold 500,000 units at launch. Over a year later Coleco made a version for its rival's Atari 2600. Sega was also planning to release a version with Coleco.Falcon was licensed to distribute the game in Europe, which it did so with modified graphics and the name "Crazy Kong" (this is often mistaken to be a bootleg game). They did the same with the sequel Donkey Kong Junior, as Crazy Kong Jr./Crazy Junior. [CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Lose Your Hammer Power[CR]In the ''ramps'' level, if you have hammer power and you would like to get rid of your hammer power without having to wait for it to wear out, just kill a few barrels and move to the edge of a ramp, then drop to the ramp directly below. You will not lose a life, but your hammer power will magically vanish! [CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Lose Your Hammer Power[CR]Move Mario up the first broken ladder on the ''ramps'' level, then climb back down. Walk to the left and position Mario so that his back is almost touching the same broken ladder. Then, move him one or two steps to the right and jump. If done correctly, Mario will fall through the bottom and appear in the ''rivets'' level or re-appear after several seconds on the top ramp next to Donkey Kong. Note: This only works on some versions of the cartridge. [CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Climb ladders faster[CR]To make Mario climb a ladder faster get him to start climbing up or down a ladder, stop climbing, then climb again up/down again. Mario will climb the ladder faster.</plot>

		<title_clean>Donkey Kong Jr</title_clean>
		<plot>Mario has kidnapped Junior's Papa![CR]Donkey Kong Jr. was originally released in the arcades in 1982 as a sequel to Donkey Kong.  In this game, Mario plays the antagonist, finally having captured Donkey Kong, and has put the ape in a locked cage.  As Donkey Kong Jr., players will have to make their way through four different levels (Vines, Springboard, Chains and Mario's Hideout) in an attempt to find keys to free the little monkey's Father.[CR]Along the way, Mario will send out Snapjaws, swooping purple birds, and electric sparks in an attempt to stop Junior.  Junior can defend himself by dropping fruit found around the levels on the heads of his foes.  The more foes a piece of fruit hits in a falling sequence, the higher bonus points can be scored.[CR]Junior can also avoid enemies more easily by grabbing hold of two chains or vines at a time to climb away faster, or by jumping over his foes.  However, any long fall or falling into the water on certain levels will mean the loss of a life for Junior.[CR]In the final cut scene, Junior will free Donkey Kong and both will escape after giving Mario the boot.  Once all four levels are cleared, the game levels will start over at a higher difficulty.[CR]Like the original Donkey Kong, the earlier 1980's console versions do not have all of the levels and animations from the arcade.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Avoid all enemies[CR]During the Second Level in the Second Round, stay on top of the vines and it will be impossible for the birds to hit you.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Avoid all enemies[CR]Position Donkey Kong Jr. directly under a dirt section on the ''pelicans'' level. Climb all the way up to the dirt, then move him left, right, and left . At that point, move Donkey Kong Jr. left, right, and left again, you will climb straight through the dirt section! </plot>

At the touch of a button all their parts (head, body, feet) are scrambled up and it's up to the player to put them back together again. The game board is displayed as a 3x3 grid. Only one piece may be 'held' at a time, leaving a blank space on the board which other pieces of the puzzle can move in to. Harder levels introduce concepts such as rotation to the mix. Matching two or three parts of any creature together produces an animated acknowledgment in the form of movement.  Matching all the parts of all the creatures together wins.</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Dragonfire is a 1982 Imagic release. The player controls a prince who seeks to recover the king's treasure by stealing it from dragons, all of whom inhabit castles.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Dragonfire consists of two stages:The BridgeThe player must move the prince from the tower at the right side of the screen, across a bridge, and into the left side tower. While crossing, the player must duck under, or jump over fireballs. It is possible to jump while ducking to avoid difficult patterns of fireballs. Once across the bridge, the second stage begins inside the castle and the dragon's lair.The Dragon's LairA dragon moves back and forth, while firing wide versions of fireballs at the prince. To escape, the player must scramble about collecting the randomly placed dragon's treasure for points. Different treasures are worth different amounts of points, and more difficult castles contain more valuable treasure. Once this is done, an exit door will open, and the prince must escape to tackle another castle and another dragon.Each castle is progressively more difficult, with more frequent and faster moving fireballs and dragons. Once the player depletes lives, pressing the fire button will continue the game at the most recent level. Additionally, difficulty switches select the starting difficulty at one of seven levels. Two player alternating play is supported. [CR]</plot>

		<plot>Driving around in the car known as the "General Lee", you must avoid all sorts of obstacles in an attempt to catch up to Jeremiah Stinge. Beware though as Boss Hog and his police force are trying to chase you. The Duke boys are as usual on the side of right in this scenario and it's Jeremiah who has orchestrated things to put them on the wrong side of the law.[CR]The gameplay is a top-down view of your vehicle heading down a path vertically across the screen. Also on the screen is your speedometer, a bonus timer (faster times mean more points!) and a gear shift. The General Lee itself has gears 1 through 4 and higher gears mean MORE SPEED. As for obstacles, the path ahead of you is full of hills and oil slicks making it difficult to catch up to (and pass) your prey.[CR]Successful completion of levels results in faster chases and more obstacles on the road.

		<title_clean>Escape from the MindMaster</title_clean>
		<plot>You've been abducted! Kidnapped! Shanghaied! You find yourself in a huge maze being watched by the Mindmaster. He is testing your intelligence, reflexes, agility, etc. The honor of you and the entire human race depends on how fast you can solve the Mindmaster's puzzles and six mazes.[CR]You begin in maze one. You must go through the maze and find colored, shaped pegs then find the correct shaped hole to put it in. As if that wasn't bad enough, there is an Alien Stalker wandering the maze and if he touches you, you lose one chance. You can tell how close he is by the beeping sound. The faster and higher it is, the closer he is. He cannot pass through walls or doors. Also, starting with maze two, there are force fields in the maze that if you touch them, you lose one chance. There are also one-way doors starting with maze four. If you go through one and turn around, there is no way back. You can never go through a door when backing up.[CR]There are also skill tests in mazes one through five that you can complete for points. They are as follows:[CR]Maze 1: Agility - Move your cursor from side to side to avoid the falling bricks. The four collisions and the test is done.[CR]Maze 2: Reflexes - Press your joystick in the direction of the arrow[CR]Maze 3: Recall - Watch the sequence of flashing arrows then move your joystick in the same sequence[CR]Maze 4: Dexterity - The same as the agility test except the test is over if you get hit once[CR]Maze 5: Coordination - Land a lander onto a platform without using much fuel. You get up to five attempts.[CR]You start each maze with sixty points and every few seconds a point is deducted. The total score for each maze is the score you got on the skill test plus whatever is left of the beginning sixty when you exit the maze. If you lose all your chances or finish maze six, you will get your final score and the Mindmaster's impression of you and the human race.[CR]Atari 2600 Difficulty Switches[CR]The difficulty switch on the left controls the number of chances you get.[CR]A=5 chances[CR]B=9 chances[CR]The difficulty switch on the right controls the Alien Stalker's speed.[CR]A=Fast[CR]B=Slow</plot>

		<plot>Evolution is an arcade style action game with six levels where you need to evolve from an amoeba to a human. Each level is a different stage in evolution with it's own unique goals. The first level is the amoeba stage where you need to eat all the DNA on the screen while avoiding the spores, microbes, and antibodies that are trying to stop you. The second level is the tadpole stage. The tadpole needs to eat three flies to move on to the next stage while avoiding the very hungry fish. Next is the rodent stage, where you need to eat five blocks of cheese while avoiding the snakes. In level four you need to guide a beaver across alligator infested waters to retrieve sticks and build a dam. The fifth level is the gorilla stage, where your gorilla has to use coconuts to fight off monkeys that are trying to steel its orange stash. And finally is the human stage, where you have to use a laser gun to fight off mutants that are trying to take over the earth.</plot>

The game was developed by Rup Fulop, known for his Atari 2600 ports of Missile Command, Atlantis, and other classic titles.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Players control Proteus, who must rescue Neptina (Neptune's daughter) by taking the form of both a dolphin and a seagull.Players start the game as a dolphin, where they must submerge several screens, avoiding obstacles, and touching seahorses. Doing this helps locate the trident pieces, which are in different locations each level and playthrough.Players then assume the role of the seagull. Flying several screens horizontally reveals clouds and obstacles. The pink clouds are collected which become stars, also helping to locate the remaining trident pieces.After collecting the trident, players must again become the dolphin in order to rescue Neptune's daughter from her undersea cage. Once the game is complete, the player may continue playing at a higher difficulty.[CR]</plot>

		<title_clean>Frogger</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Frogger is a top-down, multi-stage action game. The player controls frogs home, while avoiding obstacles. The arcade game's popularity lead to many ports, remakes, and sequels.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Frogger about to cross the road.  The objective in Frogger is controlling frogs home using a four-way joystick. Gameplay is timed, and successful completion requires navigating several contiguous stages in each level.First, the frog must cross a highway while avoiding various automobiles. Lanes of traffic operate in alternating directions, and at different speeds. Getting squashed by a vehicle causes the player to lose one life, and restart the level.A median separates the highway from a river. In later stages, the median is occupied by a snake which will also cause the player to lose a life if touched. The river contains alternating lanes of turtles and logs, moving in alternate directions, and at different speeds. The turtles move in groups of two or three, and every other group submerges regularly. The player must navigate over the turtles while above water to reach logs in various configurations, and repeat the process until reaching home.Timing is critical as the player navigates the frog into one of five home slots. Missing the slot, or reaching the edge of the screen before leaping home loses the player one life, and restarts the stage. Once a home slot is filled, the stage restarts, and play resumes until all home slots are filled, causing the next level to start.Score is kept as each frog progresses toward home, points are tallied. Additionally, optional bonus points are gained by rescuing a lady frog atop a log by hopping over her, and bringing her into a home slot without dying. Further bonus points are earned through catching briefly-appearing flies in home slots, and finishing stages early.Later stages present the player with additional challenges from faster moving obstacles, faster submersing turtles, alligators occupying home slots briefly, snakes moving along logs, and trickier log configurations.[CR][B]Legacy:[/B][CR]The popular 1990s show Seinfeld had an episode almost entirely dedicated to Frogger. In the episode George Costanza learns that a pizza place he visited frequently as a child is closing down which will lead to the unplugging of a Frogger arcade machine and the loss of his high score. At the end of the episode, from a top down view identical to the game, we see George maneuver the arcade cabinet through traffic to reach the other side of the street.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Galaxian (&#12462;&#12515;&#12521;&#12463;&#12471;&#12450;&#12531;) is an Arcade game that was developed by Namco and released in October 1979. It was published by Namco in Japan and imported to North America by Midway that December. A vertical scrolling shooter game in which the player controls a spaceship at the bottom of the screen, and shoots enemies descending in various directions, it was designed to compete with Taito's successful earlier game Space Invaders (which was released in the previous year, and also imported to the US by Midway).The game was a big hit for Namco upon its release, and has been a focus of competitive gaming ever since.It was ported to the Atari 2600, Atari 5200, ColecoVision, Bally Astrocade, Nintendo Famicom, and home computers.It spawned a successful sequel, Galaga, in 1981, and the lesser known Gaplus and Galaga '88 in 1984 and 1987 respectively, as well as many later ports and adaptations. Along with its immediate sequel, it was one of the most popular games during the golden age of Arcade video games.[CR][B]Description:[/B][CR]Galaxian expanded on the formula pioneered by Space Invaders. As in the earlier game, Galaxian features a horde of attacking aliens that exchanged shots with the player. In contrast to Space Invaders, Galaxianadded an element of drama by having the aliens periodically make kamikaze-like dives at the player's ship, the Galaxip. This made it the first game to feature enemies with individual personalities. The game's plot consists of a title screen that displayed the message "WE ARE THE GALAXIANS / MISSION: DESTROY ALIENS".Galaxian was very successful for Namco and introduced several "firsts". Although not the first color video game, Galaxian took RGB color graphics a step further with multi-colored animated sprites and explosions, different colored fonts for the score and high score, the vertical scrolling starfield, and graphic icons that show the number of lives left and how many stages the player had completed. It also features a crude theme song and more prominent background music/sound effects. These elements combine to create a look and feel that would set the standard for arcade games in the 1980s such as Pac-Man.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The objective is destroy endless 'waves' of enemies. The enemy ships are arranged in a formation at the top of the screen. At regular intervals enemy ships on the sides of the formation swoop down and shoot at the player. There are 4 different types of enemy ship, each type behaves differently on its attacking run.The player must destroy all ships in a wave to complete it. With a minor exception that one yellow ship may disappear after a bombing run and will appear as an extra yellow ship in the following wave. The yellow ships attack in a formation with two red ships, the order these three are destroyed determines the points awarded for destroying the yellow. The maximum is 800 points if the two reds are destroyed first. Once a wave has been completed a red flag is added to the bottom of the screen. When 10 flags are accumulated they are replaced by a larger flag.The player has 3 lives at the beginning of the game. A bonus life is awarded when the player reaches a score of 7000 points. Once all lives have been lost the game ends. The player can only have one shot on screen at one time. This means if the player misses he must wait until the shot leaves the top of the screen to fire again. This makes accuracy very important.High ScoreThe current world record score for Galaxian is 1,653,270 points.[CR]Development and Release[CR]The game was developed by Namco in 1979, and released in Japan that year. It was designed to build and improve upon the formula of Taito's game Space Invaders, which revolutionized the gaming industry upon its release a year earlier. Galaxian incorporated new technology into its dedicated arcade system board, the Namco Galaxian. Unlike Space Invaders, which was black &amp; white and featured enemies that could only move vertically and horizontally as they descended, Galaxian had a color screen and enemies that descended in patterns and came from various directions. The result was more complex and difficult game play.In 1980, Namco partnered with the American company Midway to release the game in North America. Midway had previously published Space Invaders in the market, but had to seek new foreign partners when Taito decided to market their games themselves.[CR]Reception of Ports[CR]Home Computing Weekly in 1983 gave the Spectrum version of Galaxian 3/5 stars describing it as a well-written version and praising the graphics as fast although flickery. Softline in 1983 criticized the Atari 8-bit version of the game for being shipped on cartridge, which raised its cost, and stated that "this game becomes tedious very quickly". Famicom Ts&#363;shin in 1995 scored the Game Boy version of the game a 24 out of 40.[CR][B]Legacy:[/B][CR]Galaxian has spawned several follow-up games. The most popular of these was its immediate successor, Galaga, which largely eclipsed its predecessor in popularity, introducing aliens attacking in intricate formations, multiple shots, and bonus stages. A third official sequel, Gaplus, was released in 1984. As with Galaga, this was a fixed shooter, with limited vertical movement. However, by 1984, the novelty of the Space Invaders formula had faded, and it was no longer successful. A fourth sequel, Galaga '88, was released in 1987, and imported to North America by Atari Games. Namco then released Galaxian 3 in 1990. A final sequel, Galaga Arrangement, was released as part of the Namco Classic Collection Vol. 1, in 1995.PortsThe original arcade version of Galaxian has been ported to many different systems.

A port for the Game Boy Color was planned, but never released.Moon Alien Part 2Nichibutsu released a modified version of this game for the arcades as Moon Alien Part 2. Besides the graphics, the only main difference between this and Galaxian is the inclusion of an energy meter that drains with every second the player spends clearing a wave. If the player doesn't clear the wave before running out of energy, the ship is destroyed.Arcade sequelsMain: Galaxian (franchise) Galaga (1981)Gaplus (1984)Galaga '88 (1987)Galaga Arrangement (1995) - released as part of Namco Classic Collection Vol. 1Galaxian was one of the most widely pirated motherboards during the early '80s.

		<plot>Turmoil rocks the land and the only salvation lies in the magic of the Temple of Apshai. Unfortunately the location of this temple has gotten lost in time. Furthermore, many heros dispatched to seek it have been slain. A legend speaks that only the blood of the greatest hero of Apshai's greatest hero will be able to reclaim the lost Temple of Apshai. Unfortunately this "greatest hero" has also perished. But all hope is not lost, for the wise man, Merlis has  found the hero's son, whose blood is still able to fulfill the prophesy. With great haste, Merlis brings the youngster to the dungeon pits and leaves him to fend for himself. It is this youngster's destiny to find safe passage through the 8 levels, each of which contains passage to 99 different areas,[CR]Gateway to Apshai is a top-down action-RPG. As the desendant of a hero, the player starts with basic stats in 4 areas, Strength, Agility, Luck and Health. and basic equipment, a dagger and leather armor. Then it's time to choose a number between 1 and 99 to generate the dungeon. Once begun, the player must explore the dungeon, hidden until explored and revealed. The player can move in four directions and has standard abilities, each mapped to a different control. There are several different actions available to the player. These include: fighting with the equipped weapon, a LOCATE spell to discover traps in the room, a SEARCH spell to discover hidden doors inside of room which would otherwise look like ordinary walls.  Players may also use many of the items and scrolls that can be picked up in the dungeon. The treasure can be picked up which include weaponry (swords, bows and arrows), healing slaves, precious items and magical scrolls. Most items are only good for a single use.[CR]The Gateway to Apshai is guarded by an assortment of creatures including snakes, swamp rats, bats and many more. These enemies are only visible when they are in the same room as the player and are otherwise hidden. After 6 minutes and 30 seconds has passed, the player is teleported to the next dungeon, many versions of the game also offer the option to manually leave the dungeon at any time. Dungeons get progressively more difficult with faster and more vicious enemies.</plot>

		<plot>Gorf is a game similar to Space Invaders, alien vessels approach closer and closer in their threatening row formation.[CR]The game itself consists of four levels:[CR]1. The first level has you behind a defensive shield, defending against an alien attack. The level is a top-down view, with your ship &amp; shield on one side and the aliens on the other side;[CR]The second level is similar to the first, only your defensive shield is gone, and the enemies tend to swoop down over the level as opposed to those row formations. Bonus ships also tend to appear in this level;[CR]The third level is a change, and has you entering hyperspace. Your only goal is to survive to the end of your journey. The viewpoint switches from a top-down view to a behind-the-ship view and in effect you are heading "towards" your destination. Alien vessels flying in circular formation try to stop you;[CR]The fourth and final level is similar to the first again, with some key differences. You do not fight a wave of enemies, but a single one. A mothership with a glowing weak spot. Hitting the weak spot will instantly destroy it. The mothership also has that same shield that was yours in the first level.[CR]Finishing the game increases your rank and starts the game over at level 1 with a faster game speed for more challenge.</plot>

		<title_clean>Gyruss</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Gyruss is a 1983 shoot 'em up created by Yoshiki Okamoto and Konami in which players take command of a ship trying to warp to Earth. Along the way, enemy spaceships, lasers, and meteors will appear and must be destroyed before the player can advance.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Upon starting the game, players will be greeted with the message "2 WARPS TO NEPTUNE". Each level means the player is one warp closer to reaching the planet. Killing all enemies that appear in the level will complete the warp. The opposing spaceships will fly towards the player's ship in a pattern, often curving around the tube perspective and flying back towards the center, where they will wait. Enemy ships who are not shot while waiting in the center will fly off screen and reappear flying out from the center. Completing all the warps will display a quick cutscene of the player ship zooming towards Neptune. Next, a small bonus round called the Change Stage will start. The ships in the Chance Stage will not shoot back, allowing the player to rack up points with ease.In the arcade version of Gyruss, gameplay remains the same as the player warps from Neptune to Uranus, then Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, and eventually Earth. The final level, "3 WARPS TO NEPTUNE", is extremely fast. Completing it restarts the game over at two warps to Neptune.In the NES version, the player starts at the edge of the Solar System, then warps to Neptune, Pluto, Uranus, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Earth, Venus, Mercury, and finishes the game at The Sun.PerspectiveThe ship sprites will shrink as they move farther down the 'tube'The most unique feature of Gyruss is the perspective: the field of play is a similar to a giant abstract tube with the player's ship flying through. Enemies will most often appear at the center of the 'tube' and fly outward to give the effect of rapid approach. On occasion, 'flocks' of enemy ships will fly out from the left or right side of the screen, breaking the tube perspective.PortsGyruss proved to be a bit of a success for Konami, and ports were soon made for the Atari 2600, Atari 5200, ColecoVision, Atari 8-bit, and Commodore 64. A port to the European ZX Spectrum was also planned, but later scrapped. In 2007, an Xbox Live Arcade port of Gyruss was released with updated sound and graphics. Gyruss has found its way onto several Konami compilations, such as the Playstation Konami Arcade Classics and Konami Collector's Series: Arcade Advanced for the Game Boy Advance. Gyruss is said to be coming to Microsoft's Game Room for the Xbox 360 and PC in July 2010.Differences between the NES remake and the Arcade versionIn 1988, Konami released Gyruss to The Famicom Disk System/ Nintendo Entertainment System under the Ultra Games label. This version was much more of a remake than a mere port. Along with a slight hint of story came improved art, new music, boss battles, more planets to warp to, added Chance Stages, and different power ups. A major difference in the story was that it featured Genghis Khan as a villain.[CR][B]Enemies:[/B][CR]Excerpt from the Atari 5200 Gyruss manual -Within each warp you'll face FOUR different formations of enemy planes. The formations might emerge from the center of the screen where the planes band together--or form off screen where they can create a surprise attack. In either case, shoot down as many planes within the formation as you can and don't let them hit your own ship. Planes fire missiles, too...your only option is to avoid them...or be shot down. After the last formation appears, all the planes NOT shot down will regroup in the center and attack again. They will continue to do so until you've eliminated the last one--unless, of course, one eliminates you first.BUT PLANES ARE NOT ALL YOU NEED TO WORRY ABOUT. THERE ARE SWIRLING AND DEADLY SATELLITES AND METEORS, TOO.There are several reoccurring types of enemies in Gyruss: enemy ships, asteroids, satellites, and laser generators.Enemy ships will fly in formation from either the center (giving the illusion of depth) or from the left and right side of the screen. They will then head back to the center of the screen, growing smaller in size as they get away from the player ship. Ships in the middle of the screen can still be shot at, and neglecting to do so will cause the enemy ship to fly away and reappear later.Asteroids are round, blue blobs that start in the middle of the screen and suddenly zoom past the player. Asteroids will never change position in the 'tube' and are easily avoided.Satellites will phase into view usually right in front of the player ship and follow it around for a time. The satellites include three sections, the blue triangles, and the spiky orange middle. Shooting the orange spiky ball in the middle will double the player's firepower.The final type of enemy in the arcade version of Gyruss are the laser generators. Each generator consists of two small blue circles with yellow energy pulsing between them. Similar to asteroids, lasers will never change position and moving out of the way is the simplest way of combating them. Another way to stop the threat of laser generators is to shoot one of the two small blue circles holding the laser beam in place. This will stop the beam from pulsing and destroy the circle the player shot at, but the other half will remain on the screen and fly past like an asteroid.Like many old arcade games, all enemies are on a set pattern and basic memorization is key for high scores.[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]Gryuss makes a brief cameo in Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas.As with many Konami games, the Konami Code can be entered into the title screen of the NES remake, albeit backwards (A B A B right left right left down down up up).The main theme of Gyruss is a contemporary arrangement of Johan Sebastian Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D Minor.An even more fast-paced and electronic arrangement of the Gyruss theme can be found in Konami's Dance Dance Revolution: ULTRAMIX 2 under the name GYRUSS -FULL TILT-.According to TwinGalaxies, the highest score ever recorded for the arcade version of Gyruss was Michael Bangs's perfect score of 47,024,400.Gyruss creator Yoshiki Okamoto was fired after the release of the game due to financial disputes. He then joined Capcom where he would later produce 1942 and Street Fighter II.After making Gyruss, Yoshiki Okamoto created another classic shoot 'em up, Time Pilot.The Atari 2600 and Commodore 64 ports of Gyruss were released by Parker Brothers.According to an article in Electronic Gaming Monthly, a lifeform from the planet Gyruss is known as a Gyrussian.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]  H.E.R.O. is a platforming game published and developed by                     Activision in 1984. It was originally developed for the                    Atari 2600 but ported to many other consoles already listed on this page. The name is speculated to mean "Helicopter Emergency Rescue Operation".[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]   The main objective of the game is to rescue trapped miners. You're equipped with a       heli-pack  allowing you to          fly around the level, as well as a               laser-beam to defend yourself from the game's various enemies (             bats,             snakes,            spiders, etc). You're also equipped with           dynamite, which you can use to kill  enemies or to destroy various walls blocking your way. It's possible to use your laser beam to disintegrate the wall as well without the risk of killing yourself, although it takes longer. There are      magma walls later in the game that kill you if you touch them, making it slightly harder to plant dynamite next to, or navigate through the caverns. When you die, you're returned to the same screen as the one you were just on, costing a life. There is a        power meter on the bottom of the screen that slowly drains indicating a time limit, making later levels fairly difficult due to their length. When the power meter is drained, you lose a life. Later levels often feature a raft the player can use to float across the water unharmed.  [CR]H.E.R.O. for Xbox 360 Game Room[CR]H.E.R.O. was included in the June 23rd, 2010 Game Pack release of   Game Room for the  Xbox 360.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]As a cat burglar, your objective is to collect all of the valuable paintings in each level. You must do this while avoiding security systems, unusually located pits and robots that move back and forth. Each level has  three floors and multiple ladders that connect them. You can also travel to each floor by using either elevators or escalators. When you travel via elevator, you don't just stand in front of it and wait, but you actually have to press which floor you wish to travel to. (ie: use the keyboard to press 1, 2, or 3.) There are also locked doors that will eventually lead to more paintings. These doors can be only opened by using keys.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>In James Bond 007 you control James Bond in his multi purpose craft. This craft can travel on both land and sea, can jump over danger, or fire at enemies on the many different levels. Each horizontally scrolling level in the game is loosely based on a different James Bond movie. The levels included are Diamonds Are Forever, The Spy Who Loved Me, Moonraker, and For Your Eyes Only. Each level has a variety of enemies trying to destroy you, and a unique goal that must be accomplished to continue on (for example, you may have to land on a hidden oil rig to stop Seraffino, or find Stromberg's undersea laboratory and destroy it). If you can complete all the missions, you win the game! Good luck, Mr. Bond.</plot>

		<title_clean>Joust</title_clean>
		<plot>Joust is an arcade game developed by Williams Electronics and released in 1982. While not the first game to feature two-player cooperative play, Joust was more successful than its predecessors and popularized the concept. The player uses a button and joystick to control a knight riding a flying ostrich. The object is to progress through levels by defeating groups of enemy knights riding buzzards.[CR]John Newcomer led the development team, which included Bill Pfutzenreuter, Jan Hendricks, Python Anghelo, Tim Murphy, and John Kotlarik. Newcomer aimed to create a flying game with cooperative two-player gameplay, but wanted to avoid a space theme, which was popular at the time. Staff worked within the technical limitations of the hardware (originally developed two years earlier for Williams' first game, Defender), excluding concepts and optimizing the visuals.[CR]The game was well received in arcades and by critics, who praised the gameplay. The gameplay mechanics influenced titles by other developers. Joust was followed by a sequel four years later, and was ported to numerous home and portable platforms.</plot>

		<plot>Jumpman Junior is the sequel to Jumpman and features similar gameplay with all new levels. As Jumpman, your goal is to disarm all of the bombs on the level before time runs out. Each level consists of a variety of platforms, ladders, and ropes you will need to jump and climb to reach the bombs. To make the game more challenging, a bullet will fire on the screen from time to time which will cause Jumpman to lose a life if hit. Each level has a different theme to it, and a few also have additional dangers as well. You will encounter deadly fires, the bouncing hellstones, moving ladders, disappearing platforms, and more.</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Jungle Hunt, a side-scrolling platformer released for arcades in 1982 and for the Atari 2600 in 1983, is a three phase platformer that puts the player in the shoes of a typical jungle survivalist, tasked with rescuing a lady from the hands of a group of bloodthirsty cannibals. The game was originally called Jungle King and featured Tarzan as the protagonist, but due to copyright issues over his use, it was changed to Jungle Hunt.The first level features vine swings of varying distances, where perfect timing is required to proceed.The second level is a side-scrolling swimming challenge that pits the explorer against crocodiles. Armed with a knife, the player can choose to avoid or stab, with extra points awarded for stabbing a crocodile with its mouth open.The last level is a side-scrolling boulder jump, with a voodoo doctor end boss. Boulders of different sizes, speeds and intervals enter from the right side of the screen, and the player must leap over them. As more boulders enter the screen, timing becomes critical. The end boss shakes from side to side and leaps very high in the air. Successful completion requires timing a run directly beneath the boss character as he leaps.Like many 2600 games, the game allows you to start back at the beginning to replay at a higher difficulty.[CR][B]Controls:[/B][CR]The home console version of the game was designed for use with the classic Atari 2600 joystick controller.Level 1: Stick moves character up and down on vine. Button initiates jump.Level 2: Stick moves character up down left right. Button stabs knife.Level 3: Stick moves Character left and right. Button jumps.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Alternate Colors[CR]Press * to display the game select screen. Then, press * or # to change the screen and text colors. </plot>

		<plot>The notorious thief Harry Hooligan is on the loose! You play the part of Officer Keystone Kelly, sent in to capture Harry. Harry is trapped in a four story mall, and is running as fast as he can to reach the exit at the top. Your job is to catch up to him and send him to prison. You will need to use either the escalators at the end of each floor, or the elevator in the middle to go from floor to floor. The escalators may be further away, but the elevator moves pretty slowly so you will need to decide which route will be faster in getting you closer to your goal. If Harry can make it to the top before you catch him, you will have to retry that level. Harry has no intention of letting you catch him easily, and is hurling everything he can find in an attempt to slow you down. Shopping carts, bouncing balls, biplanes, and more will all be flying past on the screen and will either slow you down or send you back to the beginning if you get hit. As the levels progress, Harry will run faster and faster, and more objects will be tossed your way to duck and jump over.</plot>

		<title_clean>Lady Bug</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR] Anatomy of a Lady Bug Maze. Lady Bug is a Maze game in the style of Pac-Man in which players control the titular character, who must devour all of the dots on each stage in order to move forward to the next. In pursuit of Lady Bug are the nefarious Bugs, who give relentless chase and will kill Lady Bug if they catch up. However, Lady Bug has the ability to alter the maze with various turnstiles that can be pushed to block off old pass ageways and create new ones, offering escape routes from the oncoming Bugs.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The border of the screen will change color at a set rate, and when the entire border has shifted color, a signal will alert the player that a new Bug is about to be released from the center chamber. This process continues until four Bugs are in the maze, at which point the stage's Bonus Vegetable will be present in the center chamber. Eating the Bonus Chamber will score Lady Bug a large quantity of points, as well as having the side effect of freezing all enemy Bugs on screen for a brief period of time.The turnstiles are what make Lady Bug unique as a game. Each turnstile can be moved into a horizontal or vertical position, changing the layout of the maze. Bugs cannot change turnstiles, making it the player's only feasible advantage over the enemy. The game's maze is designed in such a way that it is impossible to completely block off any section of the maze, so the player must always remain agile and moving to avoid new threats. That said, arranging these turnstiles in particular patterns can confuse the Bug AI and make dot collection much easier.Advenced Strategy Perfect Play: trapped Bugs, confusing turnstile layout. Ultimately, getting high scores on Lady Bug starts with eating three blue hearts as quickly as possible in order to jack up the multiplier to five. Additionally, collecting at least one (if not more) Bonus Vegetables in each stage will pad score as well. Collecting letters at their correct colors is also key. The most difficult part of Lady Bug is avoiding the pursuers, however using turnstiles in select patterns can often confuse the computer's AI enough to protect the player for long stretches of time.Building a "home base" to hole up in works pretty well, especially if bugs need to turn multiple times to reach the player. Additionally, creating two-block reservoirs tends to trap Bugs indefinitely. Combining these two techniques can put the bugs in predictable locations, making an easy pathway to the bonus vegetable. The key to this strategy is to clear out the lower half of the screen first, since this is where Bugs tend to collect most often. Stay still in the base and wait for the bugs to settle into static positions, and then go for the kill.[CR]Bonus Items[CR] Red, Yellow, Blue.  Match colors for big bonuses.Scattered across each maze are six bonus items: Three Hearts, and three letters. These icons also shift color in cycles from a long blue period, to a fast red period, and a middle-grade yellow period. Collecting these items at specific colors is one of the keys to scoring big points in Lady Bug and can greatly increase survivability.Hearts and MultiplierHearts are linked to each stage's Score Multiplier, and should always be collected BLUE. The first blue heart collected will increase all points gained in that stage by double. the second blue heart will then triple all scoring, and the third blue heart multiples all scoring by five. Any hearts collected at other color will not affect the multiplier at all. Luckily, since the bonus items are blue the longest, these are relatively easy to collect.SpecialLady Bug SPECIAL Vegetable Harvest.Collecting the letters in the word "SPECIAL" during their short red phase is a primary goal of Lady Bug. Doing so will net a special bonus depending on the version of the game. In Arcade Lady Bug, collecting the SPECIAL bonus will give players credit for a free game. In the Colecovision version, collecting the SPECIAL bonus will send Lady Bug to a "Vegetable Harvest" stage with no enemies and many high value vegetables to eat. The Intellivision version has no SPECIAL bonus.After completing the SPECIAL bonus, players move onto the next stage.Extra Lady Bug EXTRA bonus.Collecting the letters in the word "EXTRA" during their middle-grade yellow phase with net the player a bonus life in all versions of the game. In addition, players are automatically skipped to the next stage. As the word EXTRA has only three unique letter instead of SPECIAL's five, it is much easier to complete this bonus.Collecting any letter outside of its affiliated color will net points, however will not go toward spelling its word. For instance, collecting a red letter "X" in ineffective towards the EXTRA bonus. However, the player scores more points for red letters versus yellow, and yellow versus blue, so collecting red letters that are extraneous can still help pad the score. Also, vowels like "E" and "A" can be collected either red or yellow depending on which bonus word the player intends to spell.[CR]Bonus Vegetables[CR]Each of the first 18 stages is assigned a Bonus Vegetable that increases in point value by 500 points. This vegetable appears in the center chamber after the fourth Bug has been released. By eating the Bonus Vegetable, the player gains a ton of points and the Bugs freeze in their tracks for a handful of seconds. While Lady Bug cannot kill the Bugs even while they are frozen, this can be used to great tactical advantage when attempting to collect dots in difficult places. In many situations, it is possible to collect more than one Bonus Vegetable in each stage (see below).It's also worth noting that some of the vegetables are particularly strange and somewhat out of place.[CR]Bugs[CR] Enemy Bugs: Colorful but Deadly.There are eight variations of Bugs that appear sequentially from stages one through eight. These bugs look different, however they all act the same with rudimentary AI. Bugs cannot be killed directly by the Lady Bug in any way. Even a Bug frozen by eating the Bonus Vegetable is still deadly to the touch. Bugs can however kill themselves by running into Skulls (see below).In the Colecovision version of Lady Bug, the Bugs double in traveling speed starting in stage 9. This makes the task of avoiding Bugs exponentially more difficult. They also begin to appear on a rotational basis, with Bugs 1 through 4 inhabiting stage 9, 2 through 5 in stage 10, and so on.[CR]Skulls[CR]More Skulls could equal more vegetables.Each stage contains a set number of Skull objects randomly placed in the maze. Skulls cannot be eaten by Lady Bug, and will cause instant death. Likewise, the enemy Bugs cannot eat skulls either, or they will perish and return to the center chamber. The upside to this is that any Bug that enters an empty center chamber will regenerate a new Bonus Vegetable when it is released. By doing so it is possible to collect many vegetables in one stage.Stage 1 starts with two skulls, and progressively more are added until stage 10, where there are five skulls indefinitely moving forward.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>Looping is an arcade action game for one or two players. Your goal is to guide a plane from the runway to a docking station. To do this, there are several screens you need to get past. In the first area, you need to destroy a rocket which will open the gate to the next area. Enemy balloons and city terrain all get in your way! Once you've opened the gate and flown through, you will enter a maze made of pipes. There are no enemies trying to destroy you here, but be careful not to crash into the walls! Bonus points can be earned by staying in the maze for longer periods of time or by flying faster. Once you near the end of the pipe maze, the docking station will be in sight. There will now be several twinkle monsters, green drops, and bouncing balls in the way, all of which destroy your plane on contact. If you successfully reach the goal, the game will repeat at a more difficult skill level.</plot>

		<plot>You play the part of Bounty Bob, and it is your mission to explore every inch of an abandoned mine. As you walk over floor sections in the mine, the floor will change color. When all of the floor sections have been changed in color, you can move on to the next, more challenging level. To reach all of the floor sections, you will need to figure out how to get there! You can jump (be careful not to fall too far though, or you will be squished), climb up and down ladders, and use different transportation devices that can be found on the levels (such as an elevator, slides, a springboard, or a canon!) Wandering around the mine are numerous radioactive creatures which get in Bounty Bobs way. Also scattered throughout the mines are various artifacts left behind; if Bounty Bob collects one of these, the creatures will temporarily become vulnerable. If Bounty Bob runs into one of the creatures in this state the creature will be destroyed, but if he runs into a creature while it is glowing Bounty Bob will be destroyed! There is a total of ten different levels, and to complete them all you will need quick reflexes as well as figure out a unique strategy for each level.</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]In Montezuma's Revenge, players control Panama Joe in this exploration platformer.The player has a five-slot inventory shown at the upper left of the screen. Throughout the game, players can collect several items; color-coded keys, swords that defeat skulls, scepters that grant temporary invincibility, and torches that light up dark levels.Levels are sometimes variations on previous levels. For instance, Level 3 is very similar to Level 1, except with a couple of minor changes that make the level more challenging.On dark levels, none of the platforms ladders or chains are visible until the player finds a torch. This requires blind exploration, based on the general layout of previous levels, before locating the torch and revealing the platforms for the rest of the level. However, the last level of the game is entirely dark and no torches are available.Between levels, the player falls through areas populated only by gold bars and chains. The player needs to grab the chain before the end of the bonus area to land safely at the beginning of the next level. [CR]</plot>

		<plot>In Moonsweeper your goal is to rescue miners from the moons in Star Quadrant Jupiter. You begin your mission in space where you must avoid deadly aurora flares, photon torches and space bullets from the sun in this quadrant. From time to time you will see a moon pass by, and by flying near it you can descend to the surface. As you sweep along the surface, you will see stranded miners which need to be rescued by flying over them. Also on the moons surface are various obstacles which must be avoided or destroyed, such as towers and lunar satellites as well as alien surface destroyers. Should you survive and rescue six miners (the maximum your ship can carry), then you may take off from the surface by using the accelerator rings. There are several different types of moons found in this quadrant, each with a different level of difficulty. To help out, your ship is equipped with photon torpedoes and shields (though you will lose points while using the shield).</plot>

Each scene takes place in a different location with a different perspective. First you will race through the desert with a 3-D behind the bike point of view. Rocks, cacti, scorpions, and other obstacles should be avoided or you'll crash and lose valuable time. Next you'll race a winding path uphill through the woods. This section has a top down view, and you'll lose time if you wander off the track or crash into obstacles. The final segment of the race takes place on the beach with a side scrolling point of view. Various obstacles and other racers will all get in your way here! If you crash too many times, or take too long the game will be over.</plot>

After you have enough points, you need to locate the flame spirit which is hidden somewhere within the mine. Since the mine is rather dark, you carry a flashlight with you which can be used to locate objects (such as treasure chests full of diamonds and the flame spirit.)

Once you have the crown, you need to make it to the top of the mine before time runs out. To make this task more challenging, numerous cave bats fly around which can steal the crown. If this happens, you need to begin again! At the very bottom of the mine is a deadly spider; if you're not careful while exploring this region of the mine, you could become caught in it's web and be eaten.

The player is a mouse, attempting to eat all of the cheese on the board, while avoiding being caught by the cats that roam the maze. Players collect special power pellets that can be stored until needed. When activated, the power-up turns the mouse into a dog for a limited time, who can then chase and eat the cats. However, a hawk will randomly swoop down onto the board in an attempt to kill the mouse. The hawk will kill the mouse, even if it is in "dog mode".[CR]</plot>

		<title_clean>Mr. Do!</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR]Game Overview[CR]In Mr. Do, the player controls the aptly named title character - A Clown digging his way through a series Maze levels (similar to Boulderdash or Dig Dug), collecting cherries, whole avoiding or destroying the monsters roaming the tunnels. Mr. Do is capable of digging both horizontal and vertical tunnels. Apart from cherries, the levels also features apples. Apples cannot be collected but will rather fall down once Mr. Do digs sufficient room underneath. Ideally, the apples will squash monsters that mingle right beneath the apple. On the other hand, Mr. Do can also be eliminated when an apple happens to falls on him instead. Pushing the apples around horizontally can also help moving the same into position. Furthermore, Mr. Do can shoot a special "powerball" to eliminate enemies. However, the charge is limited to one shot and Mr. Do will have to wait until the ball bounces back to him until he can use the power again.The levels are cleared when all cherries are collected, all enemies killed, the five letters spelling E-X-T-R-A (Extra Life) or a diamond is found.[CR]Food[CR]There are many types of food that give you a varied amount of points and send out Pac-Man style ghost enemies that try to kill you! Here is a list of food:Sandwich Cake Milk Jug Egg Toast Bread Pie Hamburger Cheese Jello Waffle Chocolate  [CR]Atari Version[CR]The Atari 2600 version was poorly rated for bad graphics and poor gameplay.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Freeze all enemies[CR]Collect the bonus in the middle of the screen and collect three Extra Apples.  When you do that wait till the apple at the top of the screen is on a red letter.  Then you'll freeze all of the enemies on that level.</plot>

		<title_clean>Mr. Do!'s Castle</title_clean>
		<plot>Mr. Do!'s Castle is an action platform game which has you in a castle consisting of several floors, each of which contain a variety of blocks. You control Mr. Do! the clown who has a hammer which can be used to knock out the blocks in the floor. Wandering throughout the castle are deadly unicorns which are constantly trying to catch you. Your goal is to earn as many points as possible and to progress through the increasingly difficult castles. [CR]There are two ways to complete a castle; you can either destroy all of the deadly unicorns by crushing them with blocks, or you can knock out all of the blocks which have a cherry symbol on them. In addition to the cherry blocks, there are three blocks with a key. If all three key blocks are knocked out, the door on the roof of the castle unlocks. If you make it to the door, all of the unicorns will temporarily become harmless and will contain a letter. If you hit a letter unicorn, you will earn a letter in the word EXTRA. Spell the complete word, and you will earn an extra life. [CR]The last type of block you'll encounter has a skull on it. If you knock out two skull blocks, all of the blocks between them will also be knocked out and replaced with a bridge. As the castles progress, the castle layout will become trickier and the unicorns become faster and more numerous.</plot>

		<title_clean>Ms. Space Fury</title_clean>
		<plot>Released by Sega in July 1981, Space Fury was the first video game title to use vector graphics that were fully coloured, predating Tempest and Space Duel. Space Fury also featured digitized voices, where the one-eyed alien would taunt the player prior to combat.Space Fury is a 2D shooter in the vein of Asteroids. The player moves around a square board, which wraps around to the other side whenever the player reaches the wall. Space Fury departed from Asteroids by allowing the player to choose among three different power-ups between levels. The power-ups included a three-way shot, a double-shot ahead with a single shot behind, and a double-shot behind with a single shot ahead. However, once a powerup was used, it could not be used again, making the user use strategy about when to best use them over the course of the game.Where the objects in Asteroids got smaller as they were shot, the enemy segments in Space Fury began small and grouped together into larger objects. Once formed, these completed enemy ships could begin firing on the player.Although it has since appeared in select Sega retro compilations, the only home conversion in the time of its original release was for the ColecoVision, where it joined other Sega branded titles like Zaxxon and Turbo with the special tag, 'The Official'.

Each city has a bubble shield that can sustain one hit; another hit to an unshielded city will destroy it.[CR]Players control a ship that can fire lasers horizontally and drop bomb vertically. The ship is also equipped with an energy beam that can absorb energy from energy tanks, and can also use that energy to create temporary shields around unprotected cities. The ship can also sustain up to 10 blows in each round. If all 4 cities are destroyed or the ship takes 10 hits in a round, the game ends.[CR]Nova Blast is a single player game with 3 difficulty levels.</plot>

		<title_clean>Omega Race</title_clean>
		<plot>Many people outside of the US will have not played Omega Race in the arcade, or even known it had an arcade release.  On home machines it had greater exposure, and is often regarded as a quality game. The original arcade graphics were black and white vectors, in a style consistent with Atari's Asteroids.  Console releases added some color, apart from the VIC-20 version. The aim of the game was simple; your triangular ship was tasked with destroying a variety of enemy ships in a rectangular race-track style space.  Enemy drones simply moved in formation, while activated enemies could return fire.  The levels got progressively harder as you played, with more drones becoming active at a time.  One unique feature was the controls.   In the arcade version, the direction was controled by a spinner.  On the VIC-20, using a  control stick and buttons, the ship's thrusters were based on how long you pushed on the stick which thus determined your speed and was very tricky to control.  The Atari 2600 version featured a separate controller adapter with two action buttons, in an attempt to compensate for the single action button on the standard joystick controller.   As with Asteroids, the player's ship had inertia, with the additional feature of walls on the inside and outside of the track that would cause the ship to bounce.  Player death would occur either when shot by an active enemy, or upon collision with an enemy unit.  As each wave of enemies are defeated, a new race begins. The VIC-20 release of the game was notable for being a rear-loading cartridge game, allowing for extremely fast loading times compared to the cassette tape games on the system.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Control Both Ships[CR]Start a 2-Player game using a roll controller. This will allow you to control both ships simultaneously. </plot>

		<title_clean>Pac-Man</title_clean>
		<plot>Pac-Man (Japanese: ????? Hepburn: Pakkuman?) is an arcade game developed by Namco and first released in Japan in May 1980.[1][2] It was created by Japanese video game designer Toru Iwatani. It was licensed for distribution in the United States by Midway and released in October 1980. Immensely popular from its original release to the present day, Pac-Man is considered one of the classics of the medium, and an icon of 1980s popular culture.[6][7][8][9] Upon its release, the game&#8212;and, subsequently, Pac-Man derivatives&#8212;became a social phenomenon[10] that yielded high sales of merchandise and inspired a legacy in other media, such as the Pac-Man animated television series and the top-ten hit single "Pac-Man Fever".[11] Pac-Man was popular in the 1980s and 1990s and is still played as of the 2010s.[CR]When Pac-Man was released, the most popular arcade video games were space shooters, in particular Space Invaders and Asteroids. The most visible minority were sports games that were mostly derivatives of Pong. Pac-Man succeeded by creating a new genre.[12] Pac-Man is often credited with being a landmark in video game history, and is among the most famous arcade games of all time.[13] It is also one of the highest-grossing video games of all time,[14] having generated more than $2.5 billion in quarters by the 1990s.[15][16][CR]The character has appeared in more than 30 officially licensed game spin-offs,[17] as well as in numerous unauthorized clones and bootlegs.[18] According to the Davie-Brown Index, Pac-Man has the highest brand awareness of any video game character among American consumers, recognized by 94 percent of them.[19] Pac-Man is one of the longest running video game franchises from the golden age of video arcade games. It is part of the collection of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C.[20] and New York's Museum of Modern Art.[21]</plot>

Each stage has four mazes you must complete to move on, but you can move from maze to maze by using the exits located at the top, bottom and sides of the screen. And don't forget about the bad guys trying to take you out all the while. If one touches you you're toast! You can fight back by zipping sections of the maze closed that contain power-ups that will make you invincible for a short time or clear all the screen of the baddies.

		<title_clean>Pitfall II - Lost Caverns</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Lost Caverns is the sequel to David Crane's  Pitfall. Both games were originally released for the Atari 2600 and later ported to multiple platforms. Pitfall II maintains much of the look and feel of the first game, but it opens the world up into a free-roaming adventure, rather than progressing on a linear path.  Pitfall Harry's quest in Pitfall II is to collect a diamond, find his niece Rhonda, and his cowardly lion companion, Quickclaw. Upon collecting all three, the quest ends. In most versions of the game, this is also the end of the game. On the Atari 8-bit versions of the game, Pitfall II contained a "second quest" with more difficult enemies, a more challenging level layout, and new items to collect.[CR]Significance[CR]Pitfall II is advanced for its time, and especially for the 2600 version of the game relative to the other games for that system.  It features save points, which allow you to continue again from the last cross symbol you stepped over.  When you die, sad music will play and your character will physically return to the save point while your score is deducted relative to the distance traveled back to the cross.The heroic music that runs through the game is fairly catchy, even by today's chip tune standards.  Not exactly an objective statement, but  give it a listen.  The music also changes to a slightly more downbeat version should you spend too much time not grabbing shiny loot.Among the game play modes there are the requisite running and jumping  found in the original Pitfall, along with swimming and ascending a chasm using a hot air balloon.  The enemies have also been increased to include bats (which also pop your balloons), poisonous frogs, and electric eels for the swimming portions. [CR]</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]A shortcut!Pitfall! is a 2D platforming adventure where the player has to find 32 treasures within a time limit of 20 minutes. Players control the character Pitfall Harry and have to guide him through a dense forest filled with deadly obstacles such as snakes, scorpions, rolling logs, alligator infested swamps, and bottomless pits.The game had many basic gameplay elements that are now common in all platformers. Harry had the ability to jump, swing, climb ladders and run left or right on the screen. The game places Harry on the left side of the screen by default, but a player could choose to tackle the jungle by going right on the screen. The game also had many secret passages which could be used as shortcuts.[CR]Release History[CR]Pitfall! was created in 1982 by Activision employee David Crane. The game was a technical achievement in that it had multiple animated sprites of varying colors with no flickering. Pitfall! introduced the basic concept of having a character jump around to avoid obstacles and collect items, which is now the basis for all platformers. The game was a massive success on the Atari 2600 and had ports for numerous game systems afterwards.The character in the game is lovingly referred to as Pitfall Harry.[CR][B]Fun Facts:[/B][CR]Pitfall! was used in an episode of South Park in which Father Maxy had to traverse a series of levels (with himself being the main character) to retrieve a lost scroll hidden in the catacombs of The Vatican.In 1982, then-unknown actor Jack Black was in a Pitfall! commercial.Actor Bruce Campbell of Evil Dead fame would eventually play the voice of Pitfall Harry in the Playstation version of the game.When Pitfall! was originally sold, anyone who scored above 20,000 points could send Activision a picture of his or her television screen to receive a Pitfall Harry's Explorers' Club patch.In Marvel Ultimate Alliance, the player must complete a game of Pitfall! using their own character in order to proceed in a mission.In Call Of Duty: Black Ops II: this game is playable through a secret in the Nuketown 2025 map.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Go through walls[CR]You can go through some walls by jumping high at them.</plot>

		<title_clean>Pitstop</title_clean>
		<plot>Pitstop is an action racing game featuring six different race tracks. Your goal is to earn as much money as possible by winning races in the Grand Circuit which consists of a race on each of the six tracks; each time a race is completed, you'll earn money based on how you placed and the number of laps completed before moving on. While you are racing, keep an eye on your tires and fuel; if your tires become too worn (causing a blowout) or you run out of fuel, the game will be over. To prevent this from happening, you'll need to make a pitstop. Here you control the pit crew and can replace tires and refuel. While in the pit the race is still going on, of course, so repairs need to be made as quickly as possible to get back into the race without losing too much ground. Several game options are available to control the level of difficulty and the number of laps. In addition to the Grand Circuit which is the full race, you can also practice a track in a single race or enter the mini circuit which consists of three races.</plot>

		<title_clean>Popeye</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Popeye must catch hearts, musical notes, or letter from the word "HELP" that his girlfriend Olive Oyl, who is located at the top of the screen, is tossing down. These items slowly floating items descend to the bottom of the screen and eventually 'break' unless Popeye can collect them.Popeye's nemesis, Bluto, pursues him throughout each of the repeating three stages. The Sea Hag also appears to hurl bottles, etc. at our hero. Sweet Pea and Wimpy also make appearances but only serve to provide opportunities to score more points.The three stages consist of the dock level, the street level, and the ship level. Difficulty increases each time the player completes the set of stages. Controls consist of an 8-way joystick and a 'punch' button.[CR]History &amp; Design[CR] Original Arcade CabinetPopeye was released by Nintendo in 1982. Its cabinet is the same design as the earlier more recognizable Donkey Kong and the later Donkey Kong Jr. cabinets. A cocktail table version was also released. The game was designed by Genyo Takeda and a young upstart designer named Shigeru Miyamoto. The Popeye characters were originally going to be used for Donkey Kong, but Nintendo decided to go with an original character creation that evolved into the iconic Mario. The CPU was a Z80 Chip running at 4MHz. Sound was produced using a AY8910 chip running at 2MHz. [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR] Three Stages of PopeyeTHE DOCK STAGE - Popeye must catch 24 hearts that Olive Oyl tosses down one at a time. The HUD displays how many hearts the player has collected. If a heart reaches the bottom of the screen, the player will lose a life if he doesn't retrieve the breaking heart after about 10 seconds.Bluto chases Popeye throughout the stage. There are two ways he can be temporarily disposed of. One is by punching the signature can of spinach that will periodically appear on the sides of the screen. Once the can is punched, Popeye gets stong and turns red for about 10 seconds and has the ability to punch Bluto, sending him bouncing across the screen and into the sea. Catching hearts while in this 'red mode' will also net double points. The player will get 3000 points knocking out Bluto but he will shortly climb back out and continue his pursuit. The second way he can be incapacitated is by hitting a punching bag that dislodges a bucket. If timed right, the bucket will fall on Bluto's head giving the player 2000 points and some time to grabs some more hearts before he eventually pulls the bucket off.Both Bluto and the Sea Hag like to throw bottles at Popeye. These bottles can be broken by punching them. Bluto throws his bottles in groups of four and the Sea Hag will periodically show up on the side of the screen, throw one and disappear. Sometimes there will will be one on each side and they'll simultaneously throw a bottle, attempting to 'sandwich' Popeye between them is he isn't fast enough with his punches. Bluto can also jump up to a higher level or reach down to a lower level to knock Popeye out. Players should take caution when passing Bluto directly above or below him.THE STREET STAGE - This stage is similar to the first but features a different level layout and Olive throws musical notes instead of hearts. There is also a seesaw located in the lower left corner that, if timed right, allows Popeye to be launched in the air, thanks to Wimpy standing on the other end. Once in the air, Popeye can touch Sweet Pea for a point bonus who is floating above with a balloon.THE SHIP STAGE - The final stage features similar gameplay with two different features. One is there is a sliding platform at the top. Second each time Popeye catches one of the H-E-L-P letters that Olive tosses him, a ladder step will appear. Once enough letters are caught and the ladder is completed, Popeye can climb up and rescue Olive. The Sea Hag's pet vulture will also come out on the left side of the screen. Popeye can punch it continuously for points.Once Popeye rescues Olive, players are treated to a short intermission where Popeye's theme song is played while his face appears on the screen, blowing his signature "toot, toot" on his pipe. Players are then returned to the first stage again with increased difficulty. The Sea Hag now send bouncing skulls at Popeye, which are more difficult to punch. They will also fall down from an above level and knock him on the head if he is walking directly below.[CR]Ports[CR]Popeye was ported to several popular home consoles in subsequent years including the Atari 2600 and 5200, Intellivision, Colecovision, Odyssey2, and eventually came full circle releasing on the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). Ports to computer systems included the Texas Instruments TI-99, Atari XL, and Commodore 64. A mobile phone version was also released in 2008.[CR]</plot>

		<title_clean>Q-Bert's Qubes</title_clean>
		<plot>Q*Bert's Qubes is the sequel to the game Q*Bert and features similar gameplay, but is now in three dimensions. Once again your goal is to change multicolored blocks to a target color, but now you must make sure all three visible sides of the blocks match the target color. You control Q*Bert on the playfield of blocks; Q*Bert changes the colors by jumping to a block which will cause it to rotate in the direction of his jump. Unlike the original game, you don't need to change the colors of the whole playfield, but rather need to form straight line(s) of the target colors, and when you do you can move on to the next round. Of course, to make this task more challenging are a variety of creatures (including a giant rat!) that chase you around the playfield. Each creature is a different color, and if it lands on a block where the top face is the same color then the creature falls off of the playfield, but if Q*Bert gets caught by a creature then a life is lost! As the game progresses, more creatures chase Q*Bert and additional colors are added to the playfield making it tougher to find the target color. There are no longer any discs on the sides of the playfield to carry you to safety, so make sure you don't jump off the edge! To help out, a green ball may appear from time to time; if you catch this, all the enemies become frozen temporarily.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Scrabled, Slower Graphics[CR]Begin game play using a Super Action Controller. As you begin a level, press down and hold all four buttons. This will do two things: (1) slow down the game, and (2) make some of the cubes invisible. Also, various graphics will not be updated. </plot>

Once inside the temple, you have a limited air supply so you need to explore quickly. Hidden in various rooms of the temple are numerous keys which are needed to unlock the vault. The keys and some other useful items are hidden in secret rooms which you need to locate by using your trusty pick axe or the flasks of acid you carry. To help figure out which rooms may contain hidden objects, you carry a geiger counter with you;  the higher the reading, the closer you are to something of interest! The rooms you'll be exploring are guarded by snakes, spiders, and even mummies! To deal with these enemies you carry a gun, and you can also use the acid flasks against them (ammo is limited, so use it wisely). If you are successful in your mission, you may receive a secret code which can be used to begin the game at later levels. Good luck!</plot>

		<title_clean>River Raid</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Programmed entirely by  Carol Shaw (one of the first female game designers), River Raid puts the player in control of a fighter jet tasked with flying over a river from a  top-down, vertical perspective, shooting enemy vehicles like news helicopters, planes, and civilian cargo ships. Other than dodging enemy vehicles, your primary concern is your jet's fuel level, which slowly depletes over time, and can be replenished by flying over fuel pads found throughout the environment, however shooting a fuel tank will also boost your score by several points, making whether or not to fuel up or go for the points somewhat of a strategic decision. Inexplicably, the plane will also explode if it flies over land. While River Raid features the forced movement common in scrolling shooters, you can affect the speed of the scroll with your jet by pressing either up or down on the control stick.[CR][B]Reception:[/B][CR]River Raid was the first video game in history to be listed by the German Federal Department for Media Harmful to Young Persons, cited for "its intent to compromise the minds of children by forcing a paramilitaristic [sic] education upon them, and the playing of which caused cramps, anger, headaches and aggressiveness". The Department finally admitted that River Raid was harmless in 2002.[CR]</plot>

		<title_clean>Robin Hood</title_clean>
		<plot>Robin Hood is an action game where you need to rescue Maid Marian who is being held by the Sheriff of Nottingham in a castle (and while you're at it, steal some gold to give to the poor)! Gameplay takes place on several different screens which have different objectives. First you will need to make your way through Sherwood Forest; numerous henchman are hiding here, so use your arrows to shoot them. Surviving the forest, the next section takes place outside of the castle; naturally, numerous henchman guard the castle gate. While dodging incoming arrows, you need to shoot enough of the henchman to cause the gate to open. Once it opens, you can enter the castle for the final scene. Inside the castle you will be able to find Maid Marian behind one of the many doors, and gold behind another. The rest of the doors have henchman hiding behind them, but if you can find the Maid Marian or the gold then you win this round and the game repeats at a tougher skill level.</plot>

		<plot>Your player is a mountain climber who must avoid cavemen, dinosaurs and pterodactyls as he climbs up the cliff-sides. Your goal in each level is to climb up and reach a mystical bird with great plumage, while staying one step above the bonus timer which determines how long you may stay on each level. The mountain climber has only one ability; to shoot rope at 45 degree angles which he may then climb up to other platforms. His other action is a stun beam which will allow him to walk past enemies who get too close; but will only work horizontally from him. As for power-ups, on each level is (usually 2) a flashing diamond power-up which will make him invincible and allow him to defeat monsters. Also as a power-up are glowing treasures of some kind which are worth extra points. [CR]Your player also cannot take a fall, except for extremely small ones unless he is able to climb down vines. This means that when you shoot your rope and are climbing it, you are vulnerable. Even more so because enemies are allowed to "shake" the rope until you fall off if they reach the base of the rope. Pterodactyls fly overhead and drop eggs on the player.[CR]There are 4 distinct levels; the cliff-side, the windmill, the waterfall and the peak. Completing all of these levels will restart the game with faster enemies and power-ups located in different places.</plot>

		<plot>A damsel in distress is being held in a castle by a fire breathing dragon! As Sir Lancelot, you need to ride your winged horse Pegasus to the rescue. Each level in this action game consists of two screens. First you are outside the castle which is guarded by numerous flying creatures. You need to fly around the screen and destroy all of the creatures by hitting them with your lance (careful, if they hit you instead you'll lose a life). After all of the creatures are gone, you enter the second screen which is inside the castle. Here there is a large pit of lava and a flying dragon. To destroy the dragon you need to hit it's stomach with your lance. If you are hit by one of the dragon's fireballs you'll be temporarily stunned and unable to fly. If you end up falling into the lava, you'll lose a life. If you can defeat the dragon, the game repeats at a higher difficulty level. The game ends when you lose all of your lives.</plot>

The bad snakes hunting you down will appear from various angles on the screen, often several at a time.  The game was bundled with Coleco's Roller Controller and can't be played without it.</plot>

The game was released for ColecoVision and Atari 2600, with the former offering superior graphics. An Intellivision was initially planned but never saw release. The game features, in a sound chip version, a movement from Beethoven's 6th symphony.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Gargamel has kidnapped Smurfette. While   Gargamel has wanted to eat Smurfs, turn them into gold, or simply destroy them throughout Smurf canon, it is not clear what his motivations are here. Regardless, the player takes control of a Smurf who must rescue Smurfette.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The levels scroll right to left while the player must execute jumps to traverse obstacles. These include fences and stalagmites, while enemies include spiders and bats. The player has an energy bar that depletes over time, while failure to negotiate an obstacle will kill the player. Jumping is the only method in which the player can negotiate obstacles (other than moving the Smurf left and right). The game requires exact jump and timing.Levels include a forest, cavern, and eventually Gargamel's laboratory.[CR]</plot>

		<title_clean>Space Fury</title_clean>
		<plot>Released by Sega in July 1981, Space Fury was the first video game title to use vector graphics that were fully coloured, predating Tempest and Space Duel. Space Fury also featured digitized voices, where the one-eyed alien would taunt the player prior to combat.Space Fury is a 2D shooter in the vein of Asteroids. The player moves around a square board, which wraps around to the other side whenever the player reaches the wall. Space Fury departed from Asteroids by allowing the player to choose among three different power-ups between levels. The power-ups included a three-way shot, a double-shot ahead with a single shot behind, and a double-shot behind with a single shot ahead. However, once a powerup was used, it could not be used again, making the user use strategy about when to best use them over the course of the game.Where the objects in Asteroids got smaller as they were shot, the enemy segments in Space Fury began small and grouped together into larger objects. Once formed, these completed enemy ships could begin firing on the player.Although it has since appeared in select Sega retro compilations, the only home conversion in the time of its original release was for the ColecoVision, where it joined other Sega branded titles like Zaxxon and Turbo with the special tag, 'The Official'.

		<title_clean>Spy Hunter</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Spy Hunter is a vehicle-based, vertical scrolling shooter, by legendary game designer George Gomez. The player controls an armored sports car with machine guns, and must destroy enemy cars, helicopters, and boats while protecting civilian vehicles. The track is endless with both street sections, and occasional waterways, where the vehicle switches to an armed boat.The game was well-received and spawned numerous ports, a pinball machine, an unsuccessful arcade sequel (which Gomez took no part in), and reboots.Gameplay[CR]Boat Stage, oil slick is set aflameThe player navigates a series of roads with civilian traffic, enemy cars, and road hazards for the player to either shoot or avoid. Scoring is accomplished by driving on the road (or water as a boat), and destroying enemy vehicles. There is a "High-Low" shifter to drive faster, which increases scoring and danger. Destroying a civilian pauses the score counter. After a short period of time, where a player may die unlimited times, the player has a finite number of lives. Additional lives may be earned though scoring.The vehicle has unlimited ammo for machine gun fire, and may pick up one of three additional weapons during gameplay, by entering the red "Weapons Van". The Weapons Van appears occasionally, and may be called upon in regular intervals. The player must careful line up behind the van, and accelerate into it while driving. Only one special weapon can be held at a time, and each of the three have a limited number of uses. Furthermore, losing a life also causes any special weapons to disappear.Special weapons consist of:Oil Slick - Leaves a slippery trail behind the vehicle, causing enemies to lose traction and crash. Oil slick is set aflame on water sections, and causes enemy boats to burn up.Missiles - Fires a rocket at enemy helicopters. This is the only way to destroy a helicopter.Smoke Screen - Leaves a trail of smoke behind, making it easy to escape from pursuing enemies.Music[CR]The game uses Henri Mancini's Peter Gunn theme as its soundtrack. Originally, it was to be the James Bond theme (which was Gomez' inspiration for the game), but licensing difficulties prevented the use.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Control the Supply truck[CR]To control the supply, beat the game three times then start a new game.  Go into the Supply Truck at the very beginning of Level 1 and then get out.  Next time you see the Supply truck on the side of the road, ram into it until it crashes off the course.  Then die yourself.  When you start palying again you'll be in control of the supply truck which goes much faster tha your normal vehicle and is more powerful too.</plot>

		<plot>Star Trek: Strategic Operations Simulator is an arcade action game where you take control of the Starship Enterprise. Your mission is to save the Federation from NOMAD! Before you get a chance at destroying NOMAD, you'll have to battle your way through ten levels (each consisting of multiple rounds). In each round you may encounter Klingon fighters, deadly anti-matter saucers, asteroid fields, and deadly meteors, all of which are capable of depleting the Enterprises energy. The game ends when your energy supply has completely run out. To fight these dangers, the Enterprise is equipped with an unlimited supply of phasers and a limited supply of photon torpedoes. Each round also contains one or more starbases; if you dock at a starbase, some of your supplies (such as energy and torpedoes) will be replenished. The game is played from two points of view; the top of the screen contains a third person view of the Enterprise (along with the ships gauges), and on the bottom of the screen is a first person point of view</plot>

		<plot>Repair the potholes in the road. If a beach ball gets in the way, pop it! But beware of beach bombs![CR]You are driving around a continuously deteriorating road, where potholes are forming. You must drive over these potholes to repair them. Along the way, you can drive over beach balls to pop them for points. Don't let a pothole go too long because if it does, it will become a manhole. If a beach ball falls into a manhole, it will emerge as a beach bomb, that can damage you. In a two player game, knock your opponent into the bombs. In a one player game, avoid the other steamroller as it will kill you except for the last few seconds of the round. In that short time, hitting it will kill it.</plot>

		<plot>Colecovision's only baseball game and first of the Super Action series, Super Action baseball was specially designed to work with the Super Action controllers[CR]Batting is done with an angled view wherein you see your batter in the bottom-left of the screen and the pitcher at center-right. The top part of the screen is reserved for keeping an eye on the bases. As the ball approaches, your player attempts to hit the ball with his bat to send it flying. A successful hit will result in your player having to run around the bases. Running is done with the "wheel" on the top of the Super Action Controllers. Stealing is also possible.[CR]Fielding is simple, using the Super Action controllers, players have 4 buttons to correspond to each base. Thus the ball can be thrown at any of the bases instantly.</plot>

		<plot>Super Cobra is a side scrolling shooter based on the arcade game. You're a chopper pilot on a surveillance mission in enemy territory; your goal is to make it through the various obstacle courses alive and score as many points as possible. Tall buildings, mountains, narrow tunnels, and various enemies (such as tanks, rockets, mines, and more) can all get in the way and destroy your chopper if you aren't careful. To help defend yourself, the chopper is armed with a machine gun and bombs which can be used to destroy the enemy tanks and rockets. To make the task more difficult, your chopper has a limited amount of fuel. Throughout the landscapes are fuel tanks; if one of these is shot or bombed, you will be awarded extra fuel. As the levels progress, the enemies become more aggressive, fuel becomes more scarce, and the landscape becomes trickier to navigate.</plot>

		<title_clean>Tapper</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Provide entertainment for your patrons by collecting tipsThe gameplay in Tapper is fairly simple: serve beverages to each customer that enters the bar until there are no customers remaining in the bar. For each patron that enters the bar you must fill a glass with a drink from the kegs. When the glass is full you can slide the drink along the aisle towards the advancing customer. Each time you serve customers a drink you will knock the customer away from you. In order to proceed to the next level you have to knock all the customers out of the bar by serving them drinks. In order to knock them out of the bar completely they must be fairly close to the entrance of the bar. If the customer has managed to move up over a third of the aisle then the customer will still get knocked back but hang around to finish their drink. The customer will then proceed to slide the empty mug back at you and continue his advance up the aisle toward you and your kegs.There are multiple ways to lose a life in Tapper, one of which is breaking mugs. Mugs are broken if there is no one to receive them on either side of the bar. If you are thrown an empty mug and do not catch it before it falls, it will break. This also works the other way as well; if you slide a mug down an aisle that has no customers available to receive the drink it will break. Customers are unavailable to receive your beverages when they are either consuming a previous drink or viewing the entertainment. A life can also be lost if a patron makes their way to your end of the bar where he will then proceed to throw you out of the bar. You are given 2 lives to start off with in the beginning of the game but can pick up additional lives by achieving a certain number of points. When a life is lost you must restart the level with no loss of score.StagesTapper features 4 different stages each with their own uniquely themed customers, entertainers and environment. For the first two levels you will be catering to individuals donning cowboy hats in a Saloon. For levels 3-5 you will be bar tending a sporting event where you will serve athletes from various sports. In levels 6-9 you work in a punk bar providing beverages to very odd characters including one that appears to have a safety pin in his head. This stage is where the difficulty curves the largest making it very difficult for most to make it to the next stage. For the last four levels you satisfy aliens at a space station by ridding them of their thirst using your beer/pop.Bonus RoundBonus Rounds occur after a stage is completed and give you the opportunity to win additional points. Every bonus round consists of a masked man with a villainous smile shaking up cans of beer/pop while your bartenders back is turned.

		<title_clean>Time Pilot</title_clean>
		<plot>Time Pilot as a 1982 space combat shoot 'em up arcade game from Konami. It was the first game designed by Yoshiki Okamoto. Okamoto was instructed by Konami to design a driving game, where players would try to earn a driver's license while avoiding hazards and other cars. Okamoto, inspired by Namco's Bosconian, ventured to create a space combat game, while also writing code for a driving game to disguise the secret project. Okamoto's superiors were incensed after discovering the truth, but testing revealed that players flocked to Time Pilot. Okamoto would go on to create Gyruss before leaving Konami to join Capcom.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The goal of the game is to fly around and shoot ships while trying to avoid crashing into them or getting hit by their bullets, bombs, or homing missiles. Additionally, the player can rescue fellow pilots who are parachuting throughout the level to gain additional points. After the player has shot down 56 normal ships the time period's boss ship will appear. Once the player defeats the boss ship, they move on to the next time period, or if the player completed 2001 they loop back to 1910 and the game starts over again with no ending. The time period enemies and bosses are as follows:Time PeriodEnemy ShipsBoss Ship1910WWI Biplanes Blimp1940WWII MonoplanesB-251970 HelicoptersCH-471982JetsB-522001 UFOs Mothership[CR]Time Pilot on Xbox 360[CR]Time Pilot was released on Xbox Live Arcade on August 30th, 2006 at a cost of 400 Microsoft points.

		<title_clean>Tournament Tennis</title_clean>
		<plot>Most of the conventions that became standard for tennis simulations appear in this early title - indeed many were pioneered by it. Matches can be played at quarter-final, semi-final or final level - winning at one level automatically moves you onto the next one. They can last for 3 or 5 sets, with a player requiring a 2-game lead to win a set, although a tie-break comes in at 6-6 in all but the final set.[CR]The view is pseudo-3D, from above the court, and features a shadow on the ball to give a more realistic appearance and make it easier to judge its height. Spectators turn their heads to view the action, and ball-boys run on to the court to retrieve a dead ball. Shot speed, direction and spin can all be applied, and forehand and backhand strokes are both available.</plot>

		<title_clean>Turbo</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Released by Sega in 1981, Turbo is a single-player racing game that uses a pseudo-3D, third-person, rear-view racer format, much like Namco's famous Pole Position in 1982. The arcade version of Turbo was released in Japan and North America in 1981, and in Europe in 1982.Unlike modern racing games, which feature starting and ending points, Turbo contains four screens which loop infinitely until the player runs out of time. In effect, this means that the player has to focus on keeping away from the other cars, as hitting them will cause a crash, rather than trying to win the race.[CR]ColecoVision Port[CR]While Pole Position had been licensed by Atari, Turbo was licensed by their rival Coleco. To simulate the arcade experience of the original, the ColecoVision version featured a racing wheel peripheral, which contained a steering wheel, attached gas pedal, and gear shifter that had a high and low setting.[CR][B]Legacy:[/B][CR]The other games that ran on the same Sega VCO Object hardware are SubRoc-3D and Buck Rogers: Planet of Zoom, both released in 1982. Turbo was a spiritual predecessor to Sega's popular Hang-On and OutRun franchises. [CR]</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Tutankham is an arcade game developed by Konami in 1982; in this game, players control an explorer who is grave robbing Tutankhamun's tomb. Players will search for valuable treasure (a map, an urn, a chest of gold &amp; jewels and most importantly the golden death mask of King Tut) and fight off the various creatures that guard the tomb to ultimately find the way through the catacombs.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Players must guide the explorer through a series of progressively more difficult mazes across four different stages. The explorer may move in four directions, but can only fire in two directions, left and right, making the player helpless in vertical shafts. There are also "warp zones" located in random parts of each maze that allow the explorer to be teleported from one area of the maze to another. There are several different creatures that constantly materialize from &#8220;spawning areas&#8221; within the maze and attack including asps, vultures, parrots, bats, dragons and curses. Those creatures can be destroyed to score between 20, and 60 points with either bullets or a "flash bomb&#8221;. The explorer has a single &#8220;flash bomb&#8221; per life and stage that destroys all enemies on the screen.On each stage, the explorer must pick up keys in order to unlock the door to the room where each of the treasures are kept, allowing progress to the next stage. Along the way the explorer may grab optional treasures (Rings, Crowns, etc.) for bonus points. If the timer reaches zero, the player's ability to fire is removed. Bonus points are awarded based on the amount of extra time left over when a level is completed. After players have recovered all four of King Tut's treasures, the game starts over again with increased difficulty.[CR]Ports[CR]Tutankham was ported to the  Atari 2600,  Atari 8-bit computers,  ColecoVision,  IntelliVision,  Odyssey 2,  Vic-20,  TI-99/4A and most recently the original arcade game is one of the launch games for  Game Room on Xbox Live Arcade.[CR]Additional Information[CR]The game was originally titled Tutankhamen, but the publisher discovered the full name could not fit on the final production arcade cabinet, so the title was shortenedThis game is also known as Horror Maze on  Konami Classics Series: Arcade Hits for the  Nintendo DS.[CR]</plot>

		<title_clean>Venture</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Venture is a dungeon-crawling action game originally developed by Howell Ivy at Exidy. It was released into arcades in 1981. Home versions began appearing in 1982, with Coleco picking up the rights to publish ports on the Colecovision, Intellivision, and Atari 2600. Atari Corporation would eventually re-release the 2600 port in 1988.[CR]Objective[CR]Players control Winky, a circular smiley face with a bow and arrow for a weapon. Winky can move and shoot in eight different directions. While he moves in straight lines quickly, Winky's gameplay control when shifting directions is slow and awkward. Most of the game's difficulty comes from Winky's lack of directional agility.Upon beginning a stage, players will be located in the outside "hallway". When Winky is in the stage's hallway, he is represented as a small dot and cannot shoot. The objective in the halls is to avoid green Hall Monsters while entering white doors to individual rooms.In each stage, there are four individual rooms with one or two entrance points each. In each room there is a treasure that Winky needs to grab, but also enemy creatures that will impede his path. After grabbing the treasure, Winky needs to exit the room alive. After succeeding in this task, the completed room will "white out" and become inaccessible. By completing all four individual rooms in each stage, that stage is considered complete, bonus score is tallied, and the next stage begins with new rooms and new treasure.The bonus score is determined by a timer. The faster that players finish a stage, the more bonus points they earn. There's no penalty for being slow, however players may not receive any bonus points. These bonus points are instrumental in racking up extra lives.[CR]The Treasure Chart[CR]Incomplete Chart.Each time players start a game, start a new stage, or die, they will be shown the blue treasure chart, which contains 36 question marks. Each time players find a treasure, it will replace the question mark on the chart. The act of finding a treasure requires players to enter each room, grab the treasure, and make it out of the room alive (killing all enemy creatures is, however, not required). There are nine total stages with four treasures each. While Venture is played for score, the ultimate goal is to complete the treasure chart.[CR]Hall Monsters[CR]The Hall Monster is invincible and must be avoided. The Hall Monsters are green evil entities that inhabit the halls of each stage. Each one is invincible and will pursue Winky tirelessly. In addition to guarding the halls, they will also enter individual rooms if players stick around for too long. They can not be defeated by any means, so the the only way to avoid Hall Monsters from inside rooms is to exit the room immediately. Their main purpose to to supply Winky with a sense of urgency, as each room must be completed rapidly to avoid death by Hall Monster.[CR][B]Enemies:[/B][CR]Each room is named after its creature inhabitant. These creatures almost always act identically. Some creatures won't appear until Winky enters a specific portion of the room or until he grabs the treasure. One arrow shot will kill any creature, and that creature's corpse will remain on the screen for a short period of time. In a unique twist, the corpse of any creature is just as deadly as a live creature, so touching dead enemies is not allowed. Even more so, shooting a dead corpse will reset its decomposition timer, keeping it on screen for a longer period of time. In this way, shooting wildly can be terribly counter-productive, especially if enemy corpses are blocking the player's path to the treasure or the only exit!Stages[CR]Stage 1: PinkGoblin RoomStage 1 LayoutMost outside doors are easy to get to, so navigating the inner hallways is not necessary nor recommended. Only the top right Serpent Room requires using the inside door, and it's generally simple to get to without much threat from Hall Monsters.Goblin RoomSkeleton RoomContains two doors and three goblins. The lower door is the preferred entrance, with a more direct path to the treasure and more time to line up arrow shots.Skeleton RoomSerpent RoomContains two doors and three skeletons. The left door is the safer entrance, but it's a longer path to the treasure and it can sometimes be difficult to sneak in that door from the outside. With the treasure tucked away down a far path, players must be fast.Serpent RoomWall RoomContains two doors and three serpents. Entering from the left is practically required, as the three serpents crowd around the right door and there's little to no time to react. Players should shoot enemies fast, as their corpses will likely block access to the treasure for a short duration due to the cramped quarters.Wall RoomContains two doors and four moving walls. Either entrance is a safe bet. Wait for the top or bottom wall to open all the way up, then sneak into the center. The middle area is safe, so wait patiently for the upper or lower walls to completely retract again, then run back out.Stage 2: BlueSpider RoomStage 2 LayoutUse the wide open spots on either side of the map to avoid the Hall Monsters. These spots can also be used to lure Hall Monsters away from the middle room's door, which can be difficult to get into. Most other doors are fairly unobstructed and easy to get to.Spider RoomTroll RoomContains two doors and three initial spiders, followed by two additional spiders. Once players grab the treasure, any remaining spiders and spider corpses will immediately disappear, and two new, yellow spiders will appear, one in front of each door.Troll RoomTwo-Head RoomContains one door and three trolls. The room is initially blocked off so players cannot get into the inner chambers. After a few moments, wall sections will disappear allowing players to get inside.Two-Head RoomDragon RoomContains two doors and four two-headed creatures. The enemies do not appear until the payer grabs the treasure, and two will appear down each of the exit paths.Dragon RoomContains one door and four dragons. Players will be bombarded from the moment they enter the room, so the best tactic is to shoot to the sides and try to move left or right into the open spaces in order to buy time. If the dragons are driven away from the treasure, go grab it and shoot the dragons on the way out. If players miss their first few shots when when entering the room, players can go back out the door and come back in to reset the room and try again.Stage 3: YellowCyclops RoomStage 3 LayoutStick to outside doors, as they are easiest to get into and also tend to give the best tactical advantages once players get inside individual rooms. Getting into the center room can be tricky if the Hall Monsters gather there. Try to lure them out one side, then go around the other side to the door.Cyclops RoomGenie RoomContains one door and three cyclops. The cyclops have the unique ability of warping around the room, to they can be tough to kill and tougher to anticipate. It's completely possible for a cyclops to warp on top of Winky, registering instant death.Genie RoomDemon RoomContains two doors and three genies. Players must lure the genies away from the treasure in the left corner.Demon RoomContains two doors and three demons. The demons won't appear until players enter the narrow area of the key-shaped room. Grabbing the treasure and moving back out of the narrow area fast can keep this from happening, and usually shooting only one or two demons is necessary.Bat RoomBat RoomContains one door and three bats. There's not a lot of room move around and the bats close in fast, so accuracy matters most here. If players miss the first few shots, the room can be re-entered to reset the enemy locations.Stages 4 - 9A collection of treasures. After completing the three initial stages, stage four will return players to the "pink" hall with faster Hall Monsters and slightly faster creatures in each room. The same goes for stages 5 (blue) and stage six (yellow). Stage seven again returns players to the pink hall with very fast Hall Monsters that tend to be more aggressive and take a more direct path towards Winky. After completing stages 8 (blue) and 9 (yellow), players will have completed the treasure chart. Stage 9 will continue to repeat endlessly until all lives run out.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Demon Attack[CR]Quickly enter and exit a room several times. A demon will appear outside the room and kill your character.</plot>

		<plot>The lost Imagic gameOne of the victims of the 1984 computer game industry crash, Wing War for the Atari 2600 was only released in Europe for PAL-compatible systems.  It was the only Imagic game that was not released in North America.In it, the player takes the role of a dragon.  This dragon collects eggs and elemental crystals, which it returns to its lair.  The eggs will hatch into more dragons, while the crystals give the dragon increased power if combined properly, though they can't be placed together if in opposition at the lair, lest they annihilate each other.Standing between the dragon and collecting these objects are various creatures which take a number of hits to kill (many drop the crystals you need when defeated).  Your dragon destroys these enemies with fireballs, but these are limited and so must be used prudently as they do not replenish.When the player dies, any eggs the player has collected can hatch into a new dragon with a ten fireball supply, so eggs are extra lives, in a sense.  Maneuvering resembles Joust in that the fire button flaps the dragon's wings, while fireballs are released through the unorthodox use of the upper-right diagonal on the joystick.Each dragon can take 10 hits before it becomes vulnerable, dying with the next hit.  There are multiple, varied dungeon areas to explore, and the stronger enemies increase in damage capacity as the game progresses (see the 2 , below).  Crystal collection and combination, retrieving the diamond, and killing enemies each scores points.The types of creatures (or obstacles), their crystal rewards if any, and their hit capacity is as follows (organized alphabetically):Bat - 1 hit - air crystal Beehive - 2 hits - fire    Bee Swarm - 1 hit - air  Bird - 1 hit - air   Dragonfly - 2 hits - water  Fire Demon - 2 hits - fire Griffin - 1 hit - water Hydra - 2 hits - water Rock Demon - 6 hits - no drop Roper - 2 hits - fire Spider - 1 hit - no drop Stalactite - can't damage   See Atari Age for more information.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>Spook needs to escape from the King of Id's dungeons. He slips out but Turnkey is in pursuit. He needs to solve math problems to open the way to his escape.[CR]Wizard of Id's WizMath is an educational game to teach mathematics. Using your joystick, you must move blocks into place so they complete a correct math problem and answer. If you push against a block, you will send it flying until it hits a wall or another block. You can also face a block and hold down the button. While keeping the button down, you can then slide the block as needed. There is a sixty second time limit and you are being pursued by Turnkey. Early levels require only one math problem to exit but later levels require two or more.[CR]Early in the game, you can select a floor on an elevator. The higher the floor, the more difficult the math problems. The game also asks your age. The older you say you are, the higher a floor it tries to start you on, although you can select a lower floor.</plot>

		<plot>Zenji is an action/strategy game where you control a rolling face throughout a maze. Each section of the maze can be rotated by the face. The goal is to turn the entire maze green by connecting each section of the maze to the source at the center of the screen. After all sections of the maze have been connected, you can move on to the next, more challenging level. In addition to having a time limit to complete your task, you need to avoid the flames and sparks which wander about the maze. From time to time a number will appear in a maze section and count down from 9 to 0. If you touch the number before it disappears, bonus points are earned. As the levels progress, the mazes become larger, trickier and more flames will appear.</plot>
