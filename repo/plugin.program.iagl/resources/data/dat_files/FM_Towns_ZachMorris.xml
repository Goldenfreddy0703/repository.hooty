		<emu_comment>The FM Towns Marty is a fifth-generation home video game console released in 1993 by Fujitsu, exclusively for the Japanese market. It was the first 32-bit home video game system, and came complete with a built in CD-ROM drive and disk drive. It was based on the earlier FM Towns computer system Fujitsu had released in 1989. The Marty was backward-compatible with older FM Towns games.[CR]Manufacturer: Fujitsu[CR]CPU: AMD 386SX at 16 MHz[CR]Memory: 2 MB[CR]Graphics: Fujitsu Custom Graphics Chip[CR]Sound: Yamaha YM2612[CR]Display: 640x480[CR]Media: CD[CR]Max Controllers:  2</emu_comment>

		<plot>[I]Sanjiyan Henjō[/I] is based on the manga and anime series [I]3x3 Eyes[/I]. Pai, a young girl from the immortal tribe of sanzhiyan, three-eyed demons of Chinese origin, wants to become a human again. She meets a Japanese teenager named Yakumo Fujii, whom she accidentally turns into a "wu", an immortal obedient servant of a three-eyed demon. Together, Pai and Yakumo try to regain their lost humanity.[CR]This game can be considered a side-story to the series. The player does not control Yakumo, but an ordinary high-school student named Kenichi Yamamoto. Accidentally, Kenichi comes into contact with the world of demons, and now he needs the help of Pai and Yakumo to be freed.[CR]The gameplay is standard Japanese-style adventure. The player interacts with the game world by selecting menu commands "Look", "Talk", and "Move". The game features animated cutscenes and (in its console incarnation) voice-overs.</plot>

		<plot>[I]4-D Boxing[/I] leaves behind any pretences of being a pure arcade game based on boxing, and aims to recreate the sport in full detail. The graphics engine allows for multiple camera angles and viewpoints, and considerably detailed visuals. These required more advanced hardware than was common at the time, but a stick-figure mode was included as a compromise. The moves on offer include all the uppercuts and hooks of a real fight, and the players are designed to move realistically to implement them.[CR]You progress through the game by taking on a succession of increasingly difficult fighters, and get to train your boxer in between. Advanced action replays are included as well, so you can review all that happened.</plot>

		<plot>Three months have passed since the destruction of the oceanic base of the criminal organization WWWF. One day, Blon-Win and Asshu spot an android assassin attempting to infiltrate the Unified Force base. It appears that the androids, controlled by the WWWF, intend to kidnap the scientist responsible for the revolutionary device known as PPB (Psycho Power Booster). In addition, they have developed a bionic soldier who is a clone of Blon-Win. As if this weren't enough, Blon-Win's old nemesis Dalzy appears on the stage as well...[CR][I]Dual Targets[/I] is the third entry in the 4th Unit series and a direct sequel to The 4th Unit 2. The game retains the simple sporadic turn-based battles of the predecessors. However, the core adventure gameplay has been radically simplified and modified to resemble a visual novel. There is no direct interaction with the environment; instead, the player is prompted to select emotional responses ("happy", "angry", etc.) during dialogue, as well as alternate between "Rescue", "Think", and "Fight" commands during the storyline. These choices may influence the plot and lead the game to different endings, most of which are considered "false".</plot>

		<plot>[I]Zerø[/I] is the fourth entry in the 4th Unit series and a direct sequel to Dual Targets. Only a few days have passed since the andoird assaults and the shocking encounter with Blon-Win's clone. The Unified Force gathers all its resources, preparing to engage the shady trade organization WWWF. However, a strange accident leads Blon-Win to assume that one of the Unified Force's members might be a traitor.[CR]Gameplay-wise, [I]Zerø[/I] returns to the Japanese adventure format of the first two entries, abandoning the visual novel style of its immediate predecessor. However, it still retains the emotional response system (only three out of five are present: "nice", "angry", and "sad"), which is sometimes needed to steer conversation. Topics are fixed for all dialogues. Much of the game involves looking for people located in various areas of the Unified Force base, trying to figure out who the spy is. The simple turn-based combat is present in this installment as well. The player can choose to attack any person Blon-Win encounters; however, attacking an ally would result in a Game Over regardless of the battle's outcome.</plot>

		<plot>[I]Merrygoround[/I] is the sixth installment of The 4th Unit series and a sequel to D-Again, being the second chapter of the Einheit story arc introduced in the previous game. Koshinaka's research of the data bank on board the Diabolique, a stealth aircraft carrier of the United Nations, is aimed at increasing the life adjustment factor of bionic soldiers. However, members of the Einheit assault the laboratory, and the bionic soldier Blon-Win must decipher the clues left in order to proceed with the research and confront a mysterious person named Rua Rip Salisbury in the Original Matrix.[CR]Gameplay-wise, this installment is a departure from any format introduced in the previous entries. It is essentially an interactive movie with semi-animated voiced cutscenes occupying the bulk of the game. The player is required to choose the correct character and perform the correct action within a time limit during each scene. Failing to comply with the time limit will subtract a small quantity of the "Life" bar, while choosing a wrong action will normally reduce it by an even larger amount. Once the Life bar is depleted the game is over.</plot>

		<plot>In the beginning of the 21st century, the Earth has reached an unseen level of technological progress. However, the environmental damage has also increased beyond anything the human had imagined. It was then that the disaster occurred: a huge floating fortress appeared on the Earth's orbit, and the self-proclaimed "Beast Empire" of monsters began invading the planet. Soon, a whole continent was destroyed. Humanity was on the verge of destruction. Only a special unit of agents trained and infused with the latest bio- and technological achievements can stop the monster invasion. The leader of this organization sends a group under the command of the young soldier Abel to investigate a location where the previously sent team disappeared without trace...[CR]Abel is a turn-based Japanese-style RPG set in a dark futuristic environment. The player commands Abel and his teammates from the headquarters, where they can rest, receive items, and prepare for the next mission. The missions themselves take place in large dungeon-like areas. Randomly appearing enemies must be defeated in first-person perspective combat with a rather standard system: characters either attack physically, use items, or execute special attacks that require "special points" (equivalent to magic). There is also an Auto option for battles.</plot>

		<plot>Jeremy Hartwood has committed suicide in his Louisiana mansion, Derceto. You take the role of either Edward Carnby, a private investigator, or Emily Hartwood, Jeremy's niece, and investigate the suspicious death. The three-floor mansion is reputed to be haunted by its eccentric past owner. Very quickly, you realise that it is. Warped rats, zombies and giant worms are among the foes who are after you, and you must somehow escape.[CR]Alone in the Dark is an action-adventure survival horror game. The action is displayed from a number of fixed viewpoints. The backgrounds are 2D painted images, while the player character, all items and monsters are rendered as 3D models.[CR]To escape the mansion, you'll have to solve a number of puzzles. They usually involve finding an item and using it in a proper place. Apart from items necessary for the puzzles, you can also find books and documents that can be read, healing items which can be consumed to restore hit points, and weapons.[CR]Weapons come in handy, since Derceto is full of various monsters. Some monsters can be killed with weapons, but others are either impossible to kill or require a bit of thinking to take down. Note also that you have limited amounts of ammunition, so you have to use firearms carefully.</plot>

		<plot>In Alone in the Dark 2, you take the role of detective Edward Carnby, one of the two main characters in the original Alone in the Dark. Carnby is now called upon to investigate a bootlegger named One Eyed Jack after an old detective college name Stryker attributes Jack to the kidnapping of young Grace Saunders. Stryker attempts to infiltrate Jack's dilapidated mansion of Hell's Kitchen and rescue the girl, only to disappear himself. That's where Carnby comes in.[CR]Carnby soon learns that Jack and his gangsters are really 15th century pirates who gained immortality after Jack joined forces with Elizabeth Jarret, a Voodoo witch. However the dark magic which keeps them immortal also requires Jack and his crew to regularly make human sacrifices (which explains Grace's kidnapping).[CR]Now Carnby must battle his way through Hell's Kitchen and Jack's army of tommy-gun wielding gangsters, searching for a way to break the spell and make them stay dead.[CR]Alone in the Dark 2 is an action-adventure game, similar to the original Alone in the Dark. Like its predecessor, the game uses hybrid 2D-3D graphics. Completing the game requires you to solve a lot of puzzles while fighting zombie pirates along the way. Some enemies can be killed with the numerous weapons at your disposal, while others need to be defeated via trickery.[CR]Apart from Edward Carnby, the game also includes a short section (two sections in the CD-ROM version) where you play as the little Grace Saunders. Grace obviously cannot fight, and thus the sections featuring her are all about fast reflexes and wits to evade and outsmart the enemies.</plot>

		<plot>Wisperad is a small universe that consists of only a few star systems. Hundreds of years ago, light-speed travel was invented, allowing the inhabitants of different star systems to navigate spaceships and establish contact with each other. Three hundred years ago, a great leader named Dumna founded a centralized kingdom where the different races populating the universe could leave in peace. However, after his death political tensions have increased, eventually resulting in the dissolution of the kingdom and the partition of Wisperad into three spheres of influence: the Mars Confederation, the Kingdom of Willia, and the Empire of Zolius.[CR]A young man named Sion Asmarn lives in the town of Cosma on the planet Homu together with his father, a famous explorer. One day, a huge meteorite falls on the planet. Sion's father goes to investigate it together with the physicist Mamon Penrose. Sion and his girlfriend Shoko, Mamon's daughter, venture into the canyon where the meteorite has fallen, only to witness Mamon, apparently possessed by a mysterious force, killing Sion's father and escaping. Determined to get to the bottom of this terrible affair, the two embark on a journey that takes them to different corners of the universe.[CR]Alshark is a Japanese-style sci-fi role-playing game with several distinguishing features. The player controls a party of up to five characters, exploring a vast world consisting of several solar systems, each with its own planets and space stations, many of which can be accessed in any order. Navigation in space is done with the help of the space ship Atlia, which can be equipped with various weapons, engines and frames. From time to time the player will engage in random space combat against enemy ships, earning scrap that can be converted into money. These dogfights are automatic by default, but the player can choose to control the ship and fire its weapons manually, in an arcade shooter style.[CR]The bulk of the exploration, however, takes place on planet surfaces, which the party can explore on foot or in vehicles such as buggies, tanks or hovercrafts. Enemies appear randomly; combat is turn-based and is viewed from the same overhead perspective as the exploration. Only Sion is directly controlled by the player, while other characters follow AI routines, using normal attacks as well as offensive and healing techniques. Characters can equip head and body armor, futuristic melee weapons, as well as a variety of firearms. A "party talk" feature is available, with the characters being able to consult each other at any time. The game is also notable for allowing the characters to level up beyond the customary cap of 100.</plot>

		<plot>Amaranth III directly continues the story of the second game. The knight Lyann Fremdes and his lovely companion, the elf Din, the heroes of the game, head to the city of Dematria, where Din is met with joy; there is even an article about her magical healing powers in a local newspaper. All goes well till the heroes decide to visit the city Magnelia. A hostile army invades the train station and massacres people. Looks like Lyann and Din have to hide for the time being, before they can think of a secure way to stop the enemies - which is anything but easy, since the enemy seems to possess advanced technology...[CR]Amaranth III differs from its predecessors in several ways. It has a more modern setting, with steam-punk elements. The gameplay system has been re-vamped, becoming closer to a strategy RPG than to an action RPG. As before, the battles feature free movement, but it is turn-based now, with action points for each characters; the character can act as long as he/she still have action points left. There is a "Vigour" system that keeps track of characters' stamina; once the vigour is lowered, the character begins to lose hit points. Using special items and resting in inns restores vigour.[CR]The game also makes a step towards strategy RPGs by focusing less on exploration and more on pre-set, story-dictated battles. However, the small number of controllable characters and the ability to explore prevents it from being a full-fledged strategy RPG.</plot>

		<plot>[I]America Ōdan Ultra Quiz[/I] is based on the Japanese TV show of the game name. Like the original show, the game focuses on trivia questions solely related to the United States of America. Areas of knowledge include history, geography, culture, literature, sports, language, and others. The main quiz show takes place in New York and involves questions in random categories. A special travel mode allows the player to visit various locations in the USA, including notable airports, beaches, sports stadiums, and other popular travel destinations. Each of these locations has its own challenges in additional to the trivia questions. For example, in Las Vegas the player's answers are further configured by a slot machine, in Santa Fe the player is prompted to run a certain distance by rapidly pressing keys, etc.</plot>

She works in a mansion, serving another mysterious figure, a masked "Master", hoping to find clues concerning K's whereabouts by talking to the maids and learning about their own experiences.[CR]The gameplay is somewhat in the middle between a regular Japanese adventure and a visual novel, more tending towards the latter.

This is followed by an into the screen shoot-out against an enemy flying backwards and forwards, and then the final approach to the trading centre, which involves the player progressing on foot from an overhead view, and sees contact with the enemies lose time rather than energy – the player has 3 attempts to get there in time.[CR]Once the player reaches the planet, a trading aspect comes into play. Strategic purchase of the right equipment to boost the ship, as well as extra shields and firepower (which can be balanced depending on the next level).</plot>

		<plot>[I]Bell's Avenue[/I] is a collection of three very short games, all of which play like minimalist Japanese-style adventures and have stories that revolve around sex. The interaction follows the standard verb-command "Look-Talk-Think" template, without any sub-menus that would allow interaction with different objects.[CR][I]The Lyrical Story After Rain[/I], the shortest of the three, is an episode from the life of a lonely teenage girl, who meets another young girl on the train and later has erotic fantasies involving her.[CR][I]Paragon Wing Bird[/I] is considerably longer and has a sci-fi theme, the protagonist being a male adventurer from the Earth, who has encountered a race of human-like creatures in deep space and is interested in their sexual traditions.[CR][I]Kara[/I] is the longest of the three, is set in a high school, and describes a group of young girls who are eager to have their first sexual experience. This game allows menu-based navigation through various locations in the school and non-linear story progression, which can change depending on the player's choice and order of locations to visit.[CR][I]Bell's Avenue[/I] also contains [I]Under Deep[/I], a very short futuristic story, basically consisting of two bizarre sex scenes and having no interaction at all, and [I]Minimum Hour[/I], which presents, in a comical way, a few ideas for sex-based arcade games, which are not playable.</plot>

		<plot>[I]Bible Master 2: The Chaos of Aglia[/I] is a hybrid of a real-time strategy and a role-playing game. The game is set in a fictional medieval fantasy world and its story takes place on the continent of Aglia. Many primary and secondary characters are featured and eventually become controllable by the player, but the initial segment of the story begins in the small southern kingdom of Finice-Deal, focusing on a young knight who has completed his nobility initiation and must protect his country from hostile pagan worshipers.[CR]The game is divided into scenarios, each built like a large-scale tactical battle that takes place in a location comprising outdoor areas and towns. The player navigates characters in real time on the overhead battle field in a point-and-click fashion, with enemies moving in real time as well. Each character represents a unit of a different type (such as knights, archers, magicians, etc., some with a general leading them). When a player-controlled and an AI-controlled unit are near each other the player can opt to view a full-screen animated battle sequence, the outcome of which is decided depending on the combatant's parameters. Like in regular RPGs, towns can be visited and establishments such as inns, shops and bars can be accessed (however, without free movement through the rest of the town). This can be done in the middle of the battle, provided a character is positioned near a town gate. Characters gain experience points, level up, and can equip a variety of weapons, armor and accessories.</plot>

		<plot>The kingdom of Ishut was the most powerful on the continent and considered the protector of peace. That peace was disrupted when the Northern neighbor Seden attacked without warning. After a prolonged war, an Ishut knight named Gene, valiant in battle and skillful in diplomacy, married Claire, the daughter of Duke of Seden, consolidating the peaceful co-existence between the two countries. However, Gene perished in a rebellion that arose in Seden. His son, blessed by his noble ancestors, has to follow his footsteps and bring peace and glory to his homeland.[CR][I]Blue: Will to Power[/I] is a Japanese-style role-playing game with many traditional elements of the genre, including top-down world map navigation, turn-based combat, simple leveling system, etc. A stand-out feature that the game shares with other Kinpukurin RPGs is the conversation system. Each NPC can be approached with any of the four requests: information, joining, negotiation, and battle. Many NPCs would agree to join the party, which can become considerably large for that reason.</plot>

		<plot>[I]Panic Bomber[/I] is a falling block puzzle game, somewhat reminiscent of Puyo Puyo games: instead of Tetris-like abstract blocks, little colored heads are falling down and must be arranged in rows of three (vertically or horizontally), by rotating them and matching them with other heads of the same color. In this case, the heads clearly belong to the titular character of the Bomberman series.[CR]The game has similar gameplay and opponents as in the handheld version; Bomberman automatically advances on a "world map", defeating opponents in falling block contests in a linear fashion. However, this is only one part of the game, the story mode. Two additional modes are: a versus mode, which allows multiplayer gameplay of up to five players, and a timed challenge mode. In the latter, the player has to complete specific falling block-related tasks before the time runs out.</plot>

		<plot>The island of Radja was a peaceful place, ruled by a benevolent king. But one day, monsters have invaded the island. Both the prince and the princess of the kingdom were abducted. The king summons Shami, who, despite being a cute young girl, is the most powerful warrior of the kingdom. Shami has first to rescue the king's children, and eventually to find out the source of the demonic invasion.[CR]Gameplay-wise, [I]Branmarker[/I] mainly follows early Dragon Quest template: it is a top-down RPG with random turn-based battles viewed from first-person perspective. The player controls Shami and another character who joins the party. Shami can cast a variety of offensive and healing spells, the majority of which must be found in treasure chests located in the dungeons rather than bought or learned. The main gameplay takes part in hostile areas, which are reasonably complex and maze-like, taking a while to explore. Leveling up is automatic, and combat mechanics are basic Japanese RPG fare. What makes it different are the various anime-style cutscenes scattered through the game, most of which feature nudity and erotic content.</plot>

The real power Bub and Bob have however is the ability to blow bubbles. These bubbles can be as platforms to leap on, or to trap enemies. Enemies trapped in a bubble must be popped by jumping into them, wherein they'll turn to fruit. Additionally, power-ups sometimes float by in bubbles. They include lightning, which flies out horizontally at enemies, and water, which drags the player and enemies straight down flowing over platforms. Taking too long to complete any level will summon Baron Von Blubba, who will float around the screen trying to destroy the player.</plot>

Each hero starts in a different part of the game world. The characters have different abilities and spells at their disposal, but overall follow the same gameplay template. The intro sequence presents the heroes in a particular order (starting with the thief Hayate, who was caught and thrown into prison), but the player can choose to start as any of the eight heroes.</plot>

The eight heroes who were chosen by the magical pearls to stop the plans of the evil Bido to resurrect the dark god Daar continue their journeys. The young demon warrior Jakimaru is angry at Hayate for killing his companion, and he offers his service to Bido, who still hopes to defeat the eight heroes.

There are four possible candidates: the initial romantic interest Mari Inoue, the elusive Manako Sakamoto, and two co-workers - Ami and Yōko.[CR]The player can choose to start a specific chapter dedicated to each of these young women (the last two are grouped together). The gameplay largely follows the visual novel format, albeit generally with more options to choose from than it is usually the case with games of that genre. Much of the story is linear, but some decisions may influence the subsequent development of the plot.</plot>

		<plot>The fifth Can Can Bunny game is also the first direct sequel within the series. The story is very similar to the one of the previous game: once again, the hero is lonely and is anxious to get a girlfriend, or, to be more precise, to have sex with different girls. And once again, the benevolent and gorgeous goddess Swatty is here to provide assistance, together with her side-kicks, the Seven Lucky Gods from the Japanese mythology.[CR]Even though the story is pretty much the same as in the previous game, the gameplay underwent significant enhancements. The interface is still traditional Japanese-style menu commands, but there are many more locations now, many of which can be freely accessed by clicking on them while on the main map. Once the player has reached the point where he can begin the physical seduction of the girl, the interface switches to point-and-click, with context-sensitive cursor for touching, kissing, etc. It is necessary to try different actions more than once to understand what the girl considers pleasant and what not, otherwise the girl might get angry and the game will be over. There are many more girls to seduce here than in the previous game, ranging from a school girl to a Catholic nun (seriously). There are also various extras (as the title implies), including an extensive album that arranges various pictures of the girls so that they tell her story, and an additional collection of stories, in which the hero can learn more about the girls he had met in the main game, and even interact with them again.</plot>

		<plot>In this game, the player assumes the role of an ordinary Japanese young man who works in a restaurant. One day he comes home and finds seven strange creatures sitting at his table and discussing something you have no clue about. But before you decide to throw the uninvited guests out of your apartment, a beautiful green-haired woman appears. This is the goddess Swatty, and she has power over the Seven Lucky Gods, which the mysterious seven creatures turn out to be. Swatty feels pity for the lonely hero, and decides to help him to find a girlfriend.[CR][I]Can Can Bunny Premier[/I] is the fourth installment in the Can Can Bunny series. Compared to its predecessors, it is the most pure Japanese-style adventure, without the strategy parts of the previous game. The player chooses menu commands ("Look", "Talk", etc., as well as context-sensitive commands and dialogue choices) in order to advance the game. At several points it is possible to branch the story line, which mostly influences the amount of success the hero has had with a girl.</plot>

Conquering, spying, sabotage, diplomacy, whatever it takes--as long as you keep the Pope and your people happy. You have to reach 7,000 points to petition the Pope for the throne, and then you have to maintain those points for 4-5 game months to win the game. However, your rivals will attack you as soon as the Pope declares his support, so be sure you have a strong military before applying for the Papal backing.[CR]Castle building is more efficient and easier to deal with. You can also set up pre-made castles on file so that you can place them quickly. Battles are set in a full alternate screen with the ability to place and command each unit.</plot>

One fine day he meets Stella, the queen of magic world. She tells him that her duty is to sustain the balance between worlds, but now her power is fading, which means a new queen has to arrive and take her place. To find this queen, Stella tells her companion Pixie to open the gates to seven different worlds: three modern-day ones, three futuristic ones, and one "past", and sends the hero on the quest for balance in the world... and numerous sexually fulfilling encounters with pretty girls from different dimensions.[CR]The game plays like a traditional Japanese adventure, with still pictures, plenty of text, and the necessity to go through all the commands several times to trigger new ones and eventually advance the story. However, unlike most games of this kind, [I]Cat's Part 1[/I] features a point-and-click interface along with the usual menu-based choices. Thus, the player can interact with various body parts of the girls, as well as some objects, by simply clicking on them.[CR]The player must complete Modern World 1 first, but after that is free to travel to the six remaining worlds in any order. It is also possible to teleport out of the world at any time using a magic stone.</plot>

		<plot>Starting as a young Roman legionnaire in 275BC, your job is to conquer the known world through force or diplomacy, fighting on land and sea.[CR][I]Centurion: Defender of Rome[/I] is a turn-based strategy game. You start with one province, Rome, and one legion. To complete the game, you have to conquer all the provinces on the map.[CR]One part of the game is micro-managing your provinces. You set up tax rates and make people happy by organizing games. In Rome, you can organize a chariot race, a gladiatorial combat or even a simulated naval battle; this starts an action mini-game where you control the chariot rider, gladiator or ship.[CR]Another part of the game is military conquest. You can raise legions or strengthen them in any province you control (let's just hope there are enough men in the province, or your legion will be incomplete and weaker). There are three types of legions, each of them has a different strength. You can also move a legion to a neighbouring province.[CR]When you enter a province you don't yet control, you can speak with the ruler there. With luck, you can convince him to give you the province for free; but this isn't very likely, and you'll often have to fight.[CR]When your legion attacks a province, or defends one of your provinces from an invader, the game switches to an isometric view of the battlefield. You can give orders to your legion (assuming they are within the range of their commander's voice) and watch as they duke it out with the enemy forces. Eventually, one of the sides will be completely wiped out or panic and retreat.[CR]Finally, you can buy warships and have naval battles with the enemy fleet. This is represented as an action mini-game, depicting a duel of the flagships; however, the outcome of the battle actually depends on the strength of your fleet.</plot>

		<plot>Youhei is a Japanese teenager who is bored with his life, unable to find excitement anywhere. Even sexual escapades with various women don't satisfy him: he craves for real adventures. But on that particular day, his wishes were fulfilled in a very unexpected way. He was talking to a schoolmate named Mahiro, a girl he didn't even like particularly, when something like an earthquake shattered the school. Youhei and Mahiro hurried to the nearby classroom, only to find a strange mirror-like object - which in fact was a portal to a dungeon in another world. Now the two teenagers have to find a way to escape from the dungeon - and eventually to return home.[CR][I]Crystal Rinal[/I] is an adult dungeon crawler along the lines of Words Worth or Raidy games; but instead of a lonely hero/heroine, the player controls a party of two, Youhei and Mahiro, who fight randomly appearing monsters in turn-based combat. There is also a "talk" command that lets the two heroes chat with each other and comment on the situation. Some gameplay segments follow the template of a Japanese adventure, with menu-based commands and multiple choices during dialogues.</plot>

		<plot>In the year 2027, the world is controlled by two rival superpowers, the western-bloc Free World Alliance and the east-bloc Cartel. Transmissions from an FWA spy reveal the location of a secret multi-national laboratory deep within Siberia, the Cyberia Complex, where a mysterious weapon is being developed. FWA leader Devlin frees a cyber-hacker named Zak from prison and sends him to infiltrate the complex and discover the true nature of the Cyberia weapon.[CR]Unfortunately, the Cartel is also interested in the weapon and will stop at nothing to get it. Not only must Zak make his way past the Cartel forces sent to stop him, but he must also overcome the Cartel agents which have already seized control of the complex. To make matters worse the Cyberian scientist's genetically engineered creations are running rampant in the same area as the weapon and Devlin also appears to be have something up his sleeve.[CR]Cyberia is an action game with puzzle sequences and a heavy reliance on scripted events and cutscenes. The game allows limited navigation between locations, which usually lead to a puzzle or (more often) action scenes that involve either shooting down planes with a gun turret or navigating various flying vehicles, destroying enemies in a Star Wars: Rebel Assault-style confrontations.</plot>

		<plot>A young man gets involved in a struggle between the gods Martis and Mira. Serving Martis, he believes that in order to restore the balance he has to unseal this deity, the protector of all women. Fourteen chosen girls must fight alongside the hero, venturing into the depth of a sacred mountain and helping him to defeat countless monsters who live there.[CR]Made by the creators of Rance series, [I]Dalk[/I] is an erotic RPG. However, it is more heavy on strategy element than Rance games. Town navigation is done from first-person view. You choose your party members among the 14 available girls, and take them to fight in the mountain. Once you enter the dungeon, the game switches to top-down view, and you advance in turn-based mode, assigning commands to your party and waiting for the enemy party to move. You can attack when an enemy is in range, or cast spells with your magic users.</plot>

		<plot>Long time ago, there was balance in the world. Three great tribes lived in peace with each other. Up in the sky, the Heavenly Tribe; down on the Earth, the Human Tribe; and between them, the Demon Tribe. But among the demons, there were some who wanted more power. The members of the Heavenly Tribe were forced to seal the rebellious demons in what they called "Path of Light". But one of them figured out how to break the seal. The demons were now free, and they attacked the Human Tribe. Horrible massacres, ruined cities and villages, exterminated nations - it looked like the End of Days had come to the humans...[CR]...A boy named Anduke was raised in a secluded location by two female elves. It was clear that the boy possessed extraordinary powers: at the tender age of nine, he was already able to sexually satisfy his lovely nannies. But a mysterious force tore the boy away, knocking him unconscious. He awoke ten years later, in a human village. A promise given to a young girl led him to a fateful meeting that revealed his destiny: he had the blood of Heavenly Tribe in him, and was the only one able to save the Human Tribe from the demons...[CR][I]Dangel[/I] is a traditional Japanese-style RPG. Anduke meets companions on his quest, who join his party. The navigation is done from top-down perspective, while random turn-based battles use first-person view. Player-controlled characters can use regular attacks or magic. Anduke is also able to give commands to his elf companion, who has access to many magical spells. The game features full-screen anime-style cut-scenes to advance the story, many of which depict sexual encounters.</plot>

		<plot>Following a devastating atomic war between USA and Soviet Union, the Earth has plunged into chaos and destruction in the 1990-ies. It was not until the middle of the 21th century that humanity started to recover from its losses. Earth was nearly abandoned, and representative of the most powerful countries concentrated on space colonization projects. The Americans founded an organization called NSCA (National Space Colonized Association). Their project, SC (Space Colony), was a huge tower, comparable to the mythical Tower of Babel. This is also the home of the game's protagonist, who returns after prolonged space travels, and soon becomes involved in a complex struggle between countries and political organizations.[CR]The fifth installment of System Sacom's [I]Novel Ware[/I] series, [I]38000 Kilo no Kokū[/I] is essentially a visual novel. The majority of the game consists of text - dialogues, descriptions of the hero's thoughts and actions, and an extensive database concerning the scientific/political background of the game. Though graphical images (usually of people) are displayed by default in small windows, they can be turned off. The player follows the story, sometimes altering its course by selecting an action/response when such a choice is given to him by the game.</plot>

		<plot>[I]DE・JA 2[/I] starts where the previous game ended. The young researcher and archaeologist Ryuusuke Hatsushiba has solved the mystery of the ancient jewels, became a hero, and conquered the heart of the pretty Gachako. The Japanese Archaeological Society has chosen a new president instead of the old man Hyuga. But it's not the end of Ryuusuke's adventures. Suspicious circumstances surrounding the change of the president, new mysterious artifacts brought by clients, troubles concerning Gachako's friends, and (most importantly) more pretty ladies to haunt Ryuusuke's imagination - everything makes him forget his articles and his collections...[CR]Like its predecessor, [I]DE・JA 2[/I] is a Japanese-style adventure. The interface has been enhanced compared to the first game. Most of the commands are still done via the extensive verb menus and object sub-menus; once again, it is usually necessary to use those commands several times in order to gain new information and thus advance the story. However, in certain places, icon-based interface becomes available, with point-and-click interaction. The icons include traditional talking, touching, as well as less common commands such as hitting, and even an icon depicting a condom, for... err... scientific activities that are closer to anatomy than archeology.</plot>

Finally, after some efforts, he recalls his name: Luck. Profession: adventurer. He was supposed to meet his partner, a sexy girl named Sue, but instead ended up in some sort of a magical land, with zombies and angry female warriors. Soon he will learn that the land is called De FaNa, is ruled by a queen, and contains plenty of dangerous quests for an adventurer... and pretty girls for a horny teenager![CR][I]De. FaNa[/I] plays like a typical Japanese adventure, with the interaction reduced to menu-based choices, all of which depend on the context. Only in a few cases will a wrong choice lead to premature end of the game; most of the time, the player is required to try different choices until the right one triggers the next event.[CR]Unlike most other Japanese adventures, many of the screens the player sees in De. FaNa are animated. This includes Luck's numerous sexual encounters with female characters.</plot>

		<plot>In 1999, the Third World War has devastated most of the countries on the Earth. The one that emerged stronger than before was Japan. It became the world's undisputed leader in technology. In the beginning of the 21st century, a company named Nexus began developing a new technology that would eventually lead to production of cyborgs. Nexus soon became the world's most powerful corporation. By then, cyborgs broke loose and caused violent incidents everywhere. A special unit called "Hunter" was deployed to combat them. But Nexus wouldn't stop with their experiments. In 2014, their newest project began, called "Halleluja"...[CR]In [I]Deep[/I], the player can choose between four main characters, which include the result of the Halleluja project, an artificial young girl who is called "Jesus" and proclaimed to be the savior of the world, as well as three other, less important characters, all having their own agenda. The story is, however, the same for all characters.[CR]The gameplay consists of moving on a map with grids and accessing different locations. Sometimes there would be branching paths, but the progression is mostly linear and the same for all characters. Most of the locations contain one screen with a character picture. It is possible to interact with characters in point-and-click fashion, with the cursor turning to "Look", "Talk", and other commands.[CR]Sometimes, enemies would pop out and attack the player character. Some battles are pre-set and story-related. Even though the player characters have statistics and carry weapons, there are no real RPG elements in the game. The turn-based battles have a timer; if the player failed to choose an action within the time limit, the enemy will have a free turn. To make combat more challenging, the command menu is very large and has useful as well as useless commands, which are mixed up at the beginning of each turn.[CR]The game contains graphics with explicit sexual content.</plot>

		<plot>On the continent of Barnhedge, there lies a kingdom named Vagrand. The inhabitants of the country are followers of what they call the "True Religion", which teaches them, quite simply, to enjoy life in all possible ways, without controlling their desires and lust. As a result, the capital of Vagrand became the center of corporeal pleasures, and its neighbors started calling it the "Demon City". The player controls a Vagrand knight who is sent by the princess Leticia on a confident mission. But intrigues and uncontrolled lust surround the hero everywhere: opposition in the palace, a young girl named Milk who wants him all for herself, and the mysterious cult of the Moon are all there to make the hero's life hard...[CR][I]Demon City[/I] is a Japanese-style adventure. The interface consists of icons, selectable at any time, which correspond to actions such as Examine, Talk, Move, etc. The player can visit various locations in the city and its surrounding (done by choosing the Move command and a location name from the menu). During sex scenes, the interface changes somewhat, with additional icons for more specific sexual actions.</plot>

One day, his boss, the old professor Akihabara, invites him to his office and reveals some secrets concerning the young man's parents and an international crime syndicate known as Black Cross, which Akihabara was trying to bring down. Meanwhile, Black Cross sends a female agent under codename 0074 to assassinate a certain powerful man who happens to stay in the same hospital where Tanchi works...[CR]Dengeki Nurse consists of two main gameplay modes: Japanese-style adventure and turn-based one-on-one battles. The adventure gameplay stars Tanchi as protagonist, and requires the player to click on verb commands (Look, Talk, Think, Action, and Move) to advance the story. The turn-based battles have agent 0074 (Kirara) as the playable character, and occur as events dictated by the story; there is also a "Free Battle" mode (accessible from the main menu), which allows the player to fight against an opponent of his/her choice. Kirara can perform regular attacks (punches and kicks) for low damage, spend turns to charge power and unleash a devastating attack afterwards, or use various drugs for healing and supporting purposes.</plot>

The heroes of the story, the young doctor Tanchi and his sweetheart, the lovely Kirara, are enjoying a peaceful moment... when an explosion reminds them that the evil organization Black Cross has not yet been defeated. One by one, the powerful "nurses" - agents with super-powers - are sent to deal with Tanchi, Kirara, and their friends, and the only way to stop them is to use Kirara's own super-power - turning into the "electric nurse"!..[CR][I]Dengeki Nurse 2[/I] is nearly identical to its predecessor gameplay-wise. Once again, the gameplay is divided into adventure portions and turn-based battles. The adventure activities are performed by selecting the commands Think, Look, Talk, Action, and Move repeatedly, thus advancing the story. Battle mechanics are the same as in the first game: controlling Kirara, the player has to find the right balance between regular attacks, charging the power, and using drugs in order to win. A new addition are powerful "plasma attacks", then can be unleashed when the power gauge is on maximum.</plot>

The hero used its power to build the country of everyone's dreams, where peace and prosperity reigned supreme. However, an evil magician has usurped the power of the sword and used it to unleash monster minions on the kingdom. A new hero has risen, determined to enter the depths of the dungeon and rid the land of evil.[CR]The sequel to Gekirin is nearly identical to its predecessor gameplay-wise. Like the previous game, it is an action-oriented dungeon crawler that predominantly takes place in randomized mazes full of respawning enemies. All the features of the original game - breakable weapons, magic, destructible walls, etc. - return in the sequel. New weapons, armor, and item types have been added.</plot>

He starts working in a book store, and soon realizes that feelings develop between him and Megumi, a girl who works in the same place.

		<plot>[I]Dōkyūsei 2[/I] is a classic "love adventure", a genre that is also referred to (quite erroneously) as "dating simulations". You are a high-school student, whose father is a famous archaeologist traveling around the world, and whose mother died when he was a child. It is now your third year at the 88 High School, and naturally, your primary concern is your love life. Will you be able to date successfully and to come to a happy ending with one of the fifteen lovely female classmates?[CR]The game mechanics are a lot like in a "standard" adventure game (examine objects, visit various locations, talk to people, make decisions), but the plot centers exclusively around your relationship with the girls. The game has its own internal clock. You can move around your character on a "city map", visiting different locations. Every visit takes 20-30 minutes of game time. You can make appointments and visit various places at a specific time. The decisions you make influence the story.</plot>

		<plot>One of the games based on Ryuusuke Mita's eponymous manga. The story focuses on the manga's protagonist, a cute half-human, half-dragon girl named Mink. She is in love with a pop singer and dragon-slayer Dick Saucer; however, to win his love, Mink has to find a magical potion to turn her into a human. In the game, Mink and her friend Lufa and Pia are having a vacation on the beach, listening to Dick Saucer's concert on the radio. When Dick mentions Mink in his "special thanks" speech, she decides to find him no matter what, even if it means changing her own nature.[CR]This version of Dragon Half is an RPG with card-based system. The player navigates Mink, Lufa, and Pia through the top-down environments, encountering random enemies. During battles, the player selects cards for attack, healing, and other actions; there is no individual control of party members, and they also share an HP pool. The player can select several cards of the same type to increase the corresponding effect, or choose to save some of the cards for later to perform even more powerful combos.</plot>

He married his sweetheart Luna, and they had a son named Kakeru. This fifteen-year-old boy has one weakness: he likes naked female elves. But soon he learns that the evil wizard Lushifon wants to turn all people into stones and control the whole world while nobody is able to stop him. Together with the mysterious swordsman Eto and many other heroes, Kakeru must perform his ultimate quest and defeat Lushifon and his minions.[CR]In this tactical role-playing game the player controls nine units in battles, assigned according to the class of the character who leads the unit. The opponents also form similar groups, and are also divided into classes. Each class has its own range, strengths, and weaknesses. There are many characters the players can recruit to the party, and they belong to different classes (barbarians, archers, magicians, etc.).[CR]The adult content (scenes which include nudity) has been removed from the console releases. The PlayStation version has updated graphics and CG animations.</plot>

		<plot>The prophecy has been fulfilled. The world shall be ruled by the dragons. On an island far away, their lords prepare for the conquest of the lands. There is only one hope for mankind. The emperor sends out four heroes -- warriors and magicians -- to solve the puzzle of tears and prevent the invasion of the Drakkhen.[CR][I]Drakkhen[/I] is a role-playing game with a visual presentation that combines 3D landscapes and 2D interiors. The player's party will travel overland on a flat terrain made up of vectors, on which 2D objects are zoomed (The same type of engine was later used in Eternam). The player will encounter monsters and fight them in real-time combat, and discover the palaces of the dragon lords. Indoors, the player has to find a way through the maze of chambers, solving puzzles and defeating the minions of the Drakkhen. Party members are depicted in four status windows on the left side of the screen, thus allowing to see their current status and equipment at once.</plot>

		<plot>Dungeon Master is a role-playing game where the player selects four adventurers and descend into the depths of the dungeon. The gameplay is reminiscent of the 3D dungeon crawl type of role-playing games popularized by Wizardry and The Bard's Tale. However, unlike these games, Dungeon Master features real-time combat, which requires the player to click on the opponent in order to execute an attack. Another notable aspect of the game is its growth system: instead of gathering experience points and leveling up, characters improve by repeatedly using the same action. Spellcasting involves selecting and combining symbols, which can be arranged as rune sequences. The game also allows the player to directly interact with objects in the game world through a point-and-click interface.</plot>

		<plot>In Emerald Dragon the player takes control of Atrushan, a blue dragon who lives in the Dragon World. One day, he and his friends discover a ship wreck near a mountain. After examining the wreck, the dragons find a human child - a little girl. The wise White Dragon, the leader of the dragons, tells them that her name is Tamryn and that she will play an important role in their lives. The girl doesn't remember anything, and grows up together with the dragons. But when she turns fifteen, she decides to go back to her homeland - the Human World. Soon after Tamryn has left, Atrushan realizes he can't bear the separation, and asks the White Dragon to allow him to go and find Tamryn in the Human World. But a mysterious evil curse has been placed on the dragons - they can't appear among the humans in their true form. Atrushan agrees to become a human and goes to the Human World - to find Tamryn, and also a way to remove the curse...[CR]The game has many traditional Japanese-style RPG gameplay elements: Atrushan and his party travel around the game world, visit towns, descend into dungeons, and level up in an automatic fashion. One of the game's distinguishing features is its battle system. Characters are able to freely move over the battle field; the range of their movement depends on their agility rating. Only Atrushan can be given precise instruction during each turn. The player is able to position the characters strategically near or far away from the enemy, attack from different sides, and assign general strategies to the party members. Another notable feature of the game is the absence of a "world map": the game's locations are seamlessly connected with each other.</plot>

During the story mode, players can pause the game at any time in order to look up a term they didn't understand or to change the language.[CR]The exercises are:[CR] * Listening comprehension activities where players pick the right options to check their understanding of the story.[CR] * Guessing what's going to happen where players choose the question that's closest to their opinion and listen to the characters in the story commenting about the player's opinion.[CR] * Conversation practice where students can listen to the characters speech and act out the dialogues.[CR]The English game mode is a mini-game which involves 2 police officers in the game's world looking for a criminal. Players must tell the officers where they should go, write down which buildings are nearby and take note of the phone calls from the local citizens informing them where the criminal was last seen.[CR]The first volume of the game deals with Yuri's chance encounter with an old man and the events that unfold after that meeting.</plot>

		<plot>In [I]Engage Errands[/I], the player commands a unit of angelic fighters. These fighters look like pretty girls, but they are all angels, sent by the Goddess onto the Earth to stop a terrible disaster: the evil sorceress Guendola, commanding minions of orcs, has been terrorizing the land, and the Powers-That-Be see it fit to interfere and put an end to the invasion.[CR]The gameplay is a rather simple version of traditional Japanese strategy RPG. There is no exploration in the game and no movement outside of battles. The battles take place on top-down screens, and the player navigates the angelic girls in a turn-based fashion. The girls have different movement and attack ranges; for example, a knight can walk further than the wizard, but can attack only at closer range. Attacks are shown as short anime-style sequences. Experience is gained for each hit, so it's possible to level up in the middle of the battle. Sometimes armor and rings can be found, which can be later equipped on the girls.[CR]The cut-scenes between the battles are usually of sexual nature.</plot>

		<plot>Five hundred years have passed since the twelve Angelic Disciples defeated the evil sorceress Guendola. All that remained was her book of curses, for which nobody found any use. Peace descended upon the humans. But the young princess Ashura Kei showed Guendola's book to the angel Dominion; after having read the book, Dominion realized that she could attain the power of Guendola, betrayed the humans, and placed a rather embarrassing curse on Ashura's general, Leon: he was endowed with a pair of breasts... But with such "disguise", Leon found it easier to "train" the best female fighters in the country and assemble an army that would defeat evil once again.[CR][I]Hikari o Ninau Mono[/I] plays similarly to its predecessor; it is a rather simple turn-based strategy/RPG hybrid. As in the first game, the player commands a squad of pretty girls, each with her own movement and attack range. Battle sequences are now fully animated, showing unique attack moves for all characters. There is still no exploration outside of battles, but the player has more options beside equipping his fighters: as Leon, it is possible to spend an evening with a girl of the player's choice in different locations, which might lead to further erotic scenes.</plot>

		<plot>The Archmage Khelben summons the Heroes of Waterdeep, slayers of the Beholder Xanathar, for another mission. Strange things are happening in the forests near Waterdeep, centered around the Temple Darkmoon. People have been disappearing and shallow graves containing human remains have been found. Khelben teleports the party to the forests near Darkmoon so they may find out what kind of evil is working in the towers of the temple.[CR]Eye of the Beholder II: The Legend of Darkmoon is, like its predecessor, a first-person dungeon-crawling role-playing game based on the second edition of AD&amp;D; rules. It uses the same point-and-click gameplay mechanics and controls as the first game, with only minor changes. The game is set entirely in pseudo-3D maze-like areas; no automapping is available. Combat flows in real time, and characters can move as a single unit to lure enemies or avoid blows.[CR]A starting party consists of four characters, which can be transferred from the earlier game or created from scratch. Six classes (Fighter, Ranger, Paladin, Cleric, Mage, and Thief) are available. Characters can reach higher levels and learn new spells, must face new and tough monsters, and solve multiple puzzles. Compared to the first game, many more illustrated NPC encounters and cutscenes were added.</plot>

		<plot>Final Blow is an action game based around the sport of boxing. You can play the fighters in a sequence of knock-out competitions, (the computer versions also include a round-robin league). Rounds last one minute, with a short break in between them. As in the real sport, your aim is to knock your opponent down for 10 seconds, by gradually weakening him with a series of punches. You can block punches, to avoid them inflicting damage onto you. The ring is of a limited size, so players can be cornered, although the referee will intervene to break the boxers up if they become entangled in a stalemate position.</plot>

		<plot>The year is 2142. The player takes control of Conrad B. Hart, a man who has lost his memory. After barely escaping from hostile aliens, Conrad's bike crashes on an unknown planet. Conrad finds himself in the jungle, and from that moment on his quest for survival and his lost identity begins.[CR]Flashback incorporates elements of platforming, shooting, and problem-solving. The game can be described as a "cinematic platformer" (commonly referred to as Prince of Persia-style), following a design philosophy that was also manifested in Delphine Software's previous work, Another World. Compared to that game, Flashback focuses more on platforming and exploration of large levels.[CR]While a large bulk of the gameplay is dedicated to running, jumping, and shooting enemies, there is also a considerable exploration element in the game, as well as some puzzle-solving. The player navigates Conrad through platform structures, performing various moves. It is possible to simply jump or do a longer run-and-jump, run, climb, hang off ledges, and pick up objects lying on the ground.[CR]To defend himself, Conrad can shoot enemies with his gun and also use various objects (such as stones) to harm or distract them. Crouching and rolling are possible (and often essential) moves that can be executed during combat. The gun has unlimited ammunition; however, shields that Conrad uses to protect himself from attacks are depleted when he is hit, and can be recharged at special stations. Though most environments in the game are hostile, there are a few locations that are devoid of enemies. The player is usually required to talk to characters, gather information and complete tasks in an adventure-like fashion in these areas.</plot>

		<plot>The hero of the game is an apprentice swordsman who lives in a secluded tower, studying martial arts with the old master Daido. One day, bad news reach the tower: the hero's father, the great knight Allen, is missing. Receiving the blessings of the wise teacher, the hero immediately begins the long journey, hoping to find companions who would help him on his quest to find the missing knight.[CR][I]Free Will: Knight of Argent[/I] contains elements of a traditional Japanese-style RPG, such as top-down world map navigation, random battles, simple character growth (automatic level up), etc. However, it has several features rarely found in games belonging to this genre. Each dialogue with an NPC brings a menu with four options: Information, Companion, Justice, and Negotiate. "Information" corresponds to standard NPC conversation; "Negotiate" is mostly used in shops to buy items, but can also be used in specific situations to trigger events. The two other commands are the more interesting ones. It is possible to convince an NPC to join the party; this doesn't rely on story events, and since there are many characters who would join, it is possible to build completely different and quite large parties. The "Justice" commands is basically attacking an NPC on the spot. It is possible to attack anyone, even key plot characters - although in most cases, naturally, the battle will be over very quickly, and the hero would be "welcome to heaven", as the game itself calls it.</plot>

Using the keyboard control help-screen (brought up with the F10 key) during flight helps reduce the learning curve. Chat communication in real-time air battles is limited to keyboard text, which makes quick abbreviated responses a necessity.[CR]The game has SVGA graphics of 640x480 256 colors, which allows enhanced cockpit layouts, increased visibility, and realism during off-line training and online aerial warfare.</plot>

		<plot>One of the games based on the Japanese animated series [I]Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water[/I], which is loosely based on works by the famous French writer Jules Verne, in particular [I]Twenty Thousand Leagues Under The Sea[/I].[CR]The story focuses on a fourteen-year-old French boy named Jean, who is a talented inventor and an avid adventurer. Together with Nadia, a runaway circus girl of mysterious African origins, they travel all around the world in an attempt to reveal the secret of Nadia's pendant, pursued by the race of Neo-Atlanteans and their ruthless leader Gargoyle.[CR]The game's narrative is parallel to later episodes of the show, when the two young heroes have already joined forces with the mysterious Captain Nemo and travel on board the wondrous submarine "Nautilus" to the island Fiji, hoping to find the traces of a lost ship on which Jean's father was last sighted.[CR]Gameplay-wise, this is a Japanese-style adventure with the typical first-person view, still screens, and menu commands Look, Talk, Think, and Move. As it often happens in games of this genre, the player is usually required to go through the commands several times until the next event is "triggered". There are also a few ship battles which require the player to choose actions and weapons for "Nautilus"; however, they are also done in adventure fashion and are heavily scripted to be considered an additional strategy-based gameplay element.</plot>

Whether they want to destroy it, divert it, or whatever is unknown however, and you are charged with the task to find out what really is going on.[CR]The game is viewed from a first person perspective and progresses as an adventure game, where the emphasis is to explore and discover rather than solve puzzles (this seems to be the Japanese concept of an adventure game) so ultimately it is not so much of a game as it is more an interactive "tour de force".</plot>

		<plot>In the year 30 of the Meiji era in Japan (end of 19th century), a powerful family of Japanese oligarchs ([I]zaibatsu[/I]) known as "Amatsukami" has constructed an artificial island and ruled over it, basically creating a state within a state. They had high hopes of building the "Japan of the future" and educating the young ones: the central place on the island was dedicated to a high school. But years have passed, and the youngsters rebelled against the oligarchs. Chaos reigned on the island, and even terrorist attacks were not uncommon. Amatsukami Hidehiko, the last (and youngest) of the oligarchs, decides to change the way of things. Using his charisma, but also more violent tactics, he goes to the troubled school to deal personally with anyone who dares oppose him.[CR][I]Gakuen King[/I] is a peculiar mixture of typical Japanese RPG with random turn-based battles, strategy elements (recruiting students to join Hidehiko's army), and adventure elements ("search" command, finding and manipulating items), with extended sex scenes that have Japanese adventure-style menu-based interaction. The basic gameplay is that of a top-down RPG: Hidehiko walks around, fights random enemies, levels up, etc. The combat system is rather basic: Hidehiko's party (or, better to say, army) is treated like a single character - the player is only able to give general commands (attack, use special powers, retreat, etc.), after which the battle unfolds automatically. That is why the player also has to focus on adventure-like exploration to solve problems and overcome obstacles, as well as constantly enlarging the army to become stronger.</plot>

Compatible with Sharp 's analog joystick " Cyber ​​Stick ". It is possible to select the degree of difficulty. Like the arcade version, the screen is composed of sprites. In all stages other than Stage 1 and part of the final stage, effects such as tilt and rotation of the background have been deleted. In addition, the expansion and contraction pattern of the character is unusually small and the sense of depth is lost, and this point becomes felt as it progresses to the second half stage. Compared with the same version afterburner ported by the company before, the degree of portability is slightly higher, but still the game nature and the dynamic of the image are much lower than the original.</plot>

		<plot>[I]Regional Power II[/I] is set entirely in space. However, it is not a space combat or trading simulation; rather, it has similarities with grand strategy games such as Koei's historical simulation series, though with a much heavier emphasis on construction and research. The player can choose to go through a campaign, choose any of the five available scenarios in it right in the beginning, or create an own scenario in a randomly generated space map. The background for the available scenarios is fairly abstract, with the player always taking control of a nameless high commander with a few generic politicians and admirals to manage.[CR]Each planet in the player-controlled space can be used for colonizations. Space stations can be built in the orbit, and cities, factories, and other facilities constructed on the surface. All these activities are automatized and not displayed visually. The player can also build combat spaceships and outfit them with various bodies, engines, and weapons such as lasers, missiles, etc. New types of craft and accessories can be researched and eventually produced. Diplomacy and spying can be used for contact with other nations; however, the emphasis is on internal development of the fleet and fortification of the player-controlled planets.</plot>

Dates are presented as still anime-style images depicting the girl and whatever location the meeting takes place in. A set list of conversation topics is available, as well as a point-and-click interface allowing limited interaction with the environment.[CR]In order to gain more money needed for the dating the player character can bet on horses participating in races. The gambling system is quite simple and only gives general information concerning horses and their standings. The game also offers a training mode that only includes the gambling, with the dating elements omitted.</plot>

The bulk of the game takes place in a gigantic multi-story overhead randomly generated dungeon. The protagonist explores the dungeon in search of a precious sword, descending deeper and deeper, looting treasure chests, and fighting respawning enemies in action-oriented combat, which grants him experience points.[CR]Ranged and melee weapons are available, as well as attack items (bombs etc.) and special items (such as keys that unlock new areas). Equipment and items can be bought in the town's stores. The hero's weapons and armor rapidly deteriorate and must be repaired or exchanged for new ones when their rating reaches zero. It is also possible to attack walls, carving alternate pathways through the dungeon. When the protagonist dies he is teleported back to the town and the player can attempt to tackle the dungeon again.</plot>

		<rom name="mame-merged/mame-merged/fmtowns.zip" size="3100000"/>
		<plot>The story of [I]Gokko Vol. 01: Doctor[/I] is quite simple: the protagonist is a young man who dreams of becoming a great doctor, study abroad, and win the Nobel prize. In reality, however, he is just an ordinary aspiring physician who has to practice his medical skills in a Japanese hospital. However, seeing how all the doctors, nurses, and patients turn out to be gorgeous young women, the hero quickly forgets the Hippocratic oath in favor of his less altruist, but more basic instincts...[CR]The gameplay offers very little interaction and mostly involves choosing between a few dialogues lines and actions (always context-specific, without a permanent interaction menu) to advance the events. Most of the choices are purely cosmetic, though a few might lead to Game Over.</plot>

		<rom name="mame-merged/mame-merged/fmtowns.zip" size="3100000"/>
		<plot>[I]Gokko Vol. 02: School Gal's[/I] ([I]sic[/I]) is very similar in structure to the previous volume, but - as the title implies - with a different theme. The player controls a young male protagonist (default name Lance), who has spotted a beautiful girl near the gate of the prestigious Finlandia Girls High School. He is determined to gain access to the school, which is also attended by his sister. Though men are strictly prohibited from entering the school building, the hero is resourceful enough to find a way in; what happens afterwards should be clear to anyone familiar with the many high school-themed bishoujo games...[CR]The game plays very similarly to its predecessor, though the player has somewhat more freedom of choice and options this time. It walks a fine line between a "normal" Japanese-style adventure and visual novel, though due to lack of a fixed verb-based command menu it should probably belong to the latter. Most of the choices are there simply to try and see the responses; however, some of them lead to dead-end situations, which eventually result in Game Over.</plot>

		<plot>Etcetera" describes quite well the content of this game, which is the third volume in the Gokko series. While the two previous games were dedicated to certain themes or scenarios (doctor and school girls, respectively), the third one is a collection of multi-thematic stories of a sexual nature. The protagonist is a young Japanese male (default name Shouhei), and his first objective is to seduce his boss's sexy sister. In following chapters, the hero encounters other women (sports car driver, journalist, etc.), each encounter ending the way one would expect from an eroge.[CR]The gameplay is identical to the other games in the series. There is no permanent interaction menu, commands are always context-sensitive, mostly being conversation responses or choices of actions. Some choices are purely cosmetic; others might lead to Game Over; finally, certain choices unlock additional CGs. The final chapter of the game is playable only if the player has unlock a sufficient amount of CGs while playing the previous chapters.</plot>

		<plot>[I]Mandala[/I] is a mystical circle in Buddhist sacred art, while [I]Gokuraku[/I] is the Japanese term for Sukhavati, "Pure Land", the heaven of Buddha Amitabha. It is not surprising that the game with such a name concerns itself with Buddhist themes, though mostly in a comical way. The three heroes of the game, a man named Tamon (the player-controlled character), the girl Amako, and her parrot Gon, are on a quest to find the mysterious Death God, who stole a valuable jewel from a Buddhist temple where Tamon was working.[CR][I]Gokuraku Mandala[/I] is a point-and-click adventure. The player hovers the mouse cursor over objects on the screen and clicks on them to interact. Usually only type of command per object (mostly "Look" and "Talk") is eligible. There are no puzzles, and progress in the game is often achieved by repeatedly selecting commands. The player is given considerable freedom to move around the game world (by choosing locations on the map).</plot>

		<plot>The events of this game take place in London, in the second half of the 19th century. Mark Flint is a young private detective. One day he sees several men assault a young girl near his apartment. He saves the girl, only to discover that he has seen her face already on a wanted poster. But the girl (whose name is Jewel) explains that she is being hunted by the mysterious society of Rosenkreuz. Her father was a great scientist who knew how to make items out of pure ether; his zeppelin was attacked, and the Rosenkreuz are after the ether-made necklace Jewel is wearing. Mark, Jewel, and their friends have to find a way to defeat the Rosenkreuz and their leader, the ambitious Irene, who won't stop until the entire world is under her control...[CR][I]GunBlaze[/I] plays like a story-driven Japanese RPG, with the real-world setting adding some unusual gameplay elements. Most of the game takes place in urban locations (such as the city of London); instead of a world map, there is a city map with locations marked on it. Despite the fantasy elements, the game tries to keep the realistic setting without supernatural or sci-fi themes - for example, there are no magic spells or any equivalent powers. The heroes fight with guns, for which they have to buy bullets, and which require re-loading during combat.[CR]Otherwise, [I]GunBlaze[/I] preserves traditional Japanese RPG gameplay elements such as linear plot progression, simple character development system (leveling up), random enemies, turn-based battle engine, etc.[CR]Despite the historical European setting, [I]GunBlaze[/I] has typically Japanese manga/anime-style character design. The game has nudity and sexual content, though it can be considered softcore.</plot>

Tutorials teach the player to handle the copter; once the controls and flying skills are mastered, there are escalating challenges and hundreds of missions in any one of four regions of the world, including Southeast Asia, Central America, the Middle East, and the Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact allies in Western Europe.</plot>

		<rom name="mame-merged/mame-merged/fmtowns.zip" size="3100000"/>
		<plot>The game is based on the manga [I]Half Moon ni Kawaru made[/I] by Ryo Ramiya. It contains four separate stories/games, which can also be defined as mini-games due to their short length. Each story contained is dedicated to a different heroine: * Suzuka and her boyfriend escape from ninjas; they are ambushed by amazon warriors and get separated. Suzuka finds herself in a weird mansion overrun by monsters, and must fight her way with a sword. This game is an adventure with top-down movement; the goal is to find the way through the maze-like locations. There are also pre-set turn-based battles - Suzuka can choose between various techniques to defeat the foes. There is no RPG system of any kind. The sex scenes include grotesque encounters with monsters.[CR] * Eve is a saleswoman in a large company that sells items for skin care and make-up. She has to explore the neighborhood and to convince customers to buy their products. This story plays like a standard Japanese adventure with first-person view and menu-based commands. The sexual content here is mostly of lesbian nature.[CR] * The protagonist in this story is the "hero" of the entire game (default name Tatsuya); he offers his services to Selena, the queen of the medieval Rabbi-Rabbi kingdom. Evil bunnies are disturbing the peace in the country side, and the hero, aided by the lovely girl Nina, has to get rid of them and bring back the carrots. This is an action game, with bunnies popping out of holes in different stages, and the player character hitting them on the heads using various items (such as a house shoe).[CR] * The shortest game tells the story of Titis, a lovely mermaid who dreams of marrying a human prince. In search for the love of her life, Titis gets to know the world of humans through a series of sexual encounters. This game is once again a typical Japanese adventure with menu-based commands and no movement of any kind (the player switches locations automatically, as dictated by the story).</plot>

From that point, the story can branch two different ways: either she is being raped by Sumi, or seduced by the nurse Aki.[CR] * Back to Kiko from the first story; she is the playable character now, and, depending on the story branch, she either waits for her boyfriend and has sex with him, or goes outside in a disguise already seen in the first episode mentioned.[CR]All the episodes are visual novels with very little interaction; the player is only allowed to make a few choices. However, the choices usually change the direction of the events significantly, up to the point of leading to completely different situations.</plot>

		<plot>When Richard MacIntyre, the hero of the first Hiōden, became old, he retired from his duties, intending to spend the rest of his days in a secluded location together with the dryad Beatrix. But one day, the old king meets a little girl and gives her a present - a ring that Beatrix gave him long time ago.[CR]Fast-forward to present time: Marcfeand, a young man with a mysterious past and even more mysterious intentions, deliberately gets himself accused of a crime and is thrown into prison. But there, he meets Millray, a young girl with magic powers, who was wrongly imprisoned. Changing his plans, Marcfeand helps the girl to escape from her cell - but the guards are alarmed, and soon the two unlikely heroes have to fight for their lives. Shortly thereafter the two young people discover that they can re-animate and command monsters - which is the same curse the old king Richard MacIntyre was afflicted with...[CR]Like its predecessor, Hiōden 2 is a mixture of RPG and real-time strategy. The player commands one or more teams at the same time. The battles are mostly automatic, with preparation having more weight that the actual commands during battles. There is an option to "stop the clock" and adjust the strategy. Most of the gameplay involves exploring the maze-like isometric location with the player's teams, fighting enemies on the way, gathering treasure, and solving (mostly very simple) puzzles to advance to the next area. RPG element comes in form of character levels. The windows-based interface from the previous game returns, with slight adjustments (point-and-click navigation through the main area instead of clicking on arrow keys; more comfortable menu with items displayed next to the character's portrait, etc.).</plot>

The King rewards you with his magical sword, Grimthwacker, and a village, and the mission to go forth and prosper by felling waves of Hordlings, who are bent on eating everything in the province. The better you get at defending villagers, crops, and cows from Hordlings, the better equipped you become. Success wins you further favor from the King, along with bigger challenges and more enmity from the evil High Chancellor.[CR]There are several types of Hordlings, each with their peculiar style of picking through the edibles under your care. Success is measured by how many villagers and crops survive each season's gluttonous attacks.</plot>

		<plot>Gengorou Imai is a 19-year old lad who wants to have a simple life, his only passion being young pretty women. He stays in a boarding house in the country, enjoying the quiet life, the sea, the beach, and the abundance of those he likes most... So all goes well, until one of the guests who was staying at the boarding house is killed. Not entirely trusting the police, the owner of the boarding house asks Gen to look into this. Gen knows that the deceased was having a relationship with the owner's daughter. The young man begins his investigation, saying good-bye to quiet life - but not to the seductive young female tenants of the boarding house...[CR][I]Hoshi no Suna Monogatari[/I] is the first in the series of adult detective/mystery adventures by D.O.. The game world is composed of still screens viewed from first-person perspective; navigation is done by selecting locations from a menu. At every screen, a full list of commands is available, from the standard "Look" and "Talk" to the more specific "Kiss", as well as "Ask", "Use Item", and "Show Item". Advancing in the game usually means investigating the locations, talking to everyone, asking the right person about the right topic, and showing the right person the right item.</plot>

The stage of events is once again a boarding house in the country, this time in the winter season, with skiing and other attractions. Gen is having a good time with the young, but "demanding" Reiko Honda, when the news strike: a family friend, a young foreigner named Eddie, is stabbed by an unknown assailant. The only clue Gen can find right away are strange letters written in blood: H and O. What do they mean? Why would anyone want to harm the young boy? With the help of the many pretty girls at the boarding house and its surroundings, Gen begins the investigation, determined to find the criminal...[CR][I]Hoshi no Suna Monogatari 2[/I] plays almost identically to the first game, the only interface-related difference being the addition of a mouse. Otherwise, the player follows the same procedure: look at everything; talk to everyone; find the items needed to advance the investigation; ask the right person the right question, and show the right item to the right person - all done by selecting commands and topics from the extensive verb menu.</plot>

		<plot>The third entry in the Hoshi no Suna Monogatari series is also the first one not to have Gengorou Imai as the protagonist (although he does have a cameo appearance in the game). The playable character this time is the 23-year-old Mine Takaishi. He dropped out of college because of opinion difference with a teacher; now he is poor and can only have jobs as a tutor. Luckily, one of the girls he teaches has a rich family, which sends her on a vacation at the fashionable boarding house on the sea shore, owned by a relative named Uminoya; the private teacher accompanies her. Several relatives also stay at the boarding house, and all goes well until one of them, the owner's younger brother, suddenly feels very sick after having dinner... He is taken to the hospital, and Mine begins to investigate the boarding house and its surrounding, suspecting foul play...[CR]Like the previous entries in the series, [I]Hoshi no Suna Monogatari 3[/I] is a detective/mystery adventure. There are no significant changes to the interface, beside the addition of several context-related verbs (such as "Take") to the list of available commands. The navigation is also done through a menu, basically "jumping" from screen to screen. There is some investigating work (questioning, gathering items, etc.) to be done, but like in many Japanese adventures, advancing the story is often a matter of visiting all the locations and hoping to trigger events by "bumping" into characters.</plot>

		<plot>In Idol Project, the player takes a role of a young man named Takashi, who works for a company called Mobius, an agency whose goal is to turn young Japanese girls into famous singers. The game can be qualified as simulation: the main gameplay focus is on finding young talents and helping them to become famous. There is also a strong RPG element in the game. Takashi and his recruited "stars" gain levels according to their success. Takashi also has two other parameters, "Power" and "HP". "Power" is Takashi's stamina, which depletes regularly and can be restored with food, sleep, medicine, etc. "HP" in this game is the amount of work stress the protagonist has.</plot>

Raidi decides to enter the tower and to free the prisoners.[CR][I]Ikazuchi no Senshi Raidi[/I] is a rather basic dungeon-crawler with a twist: hentai. The enemies in the game are female (demonic female, but female nevertheless); when Raidi defeats them, they lose their clothes. There are also event scenes that contain sexual images. The gameplay involves Raidi moving through pseudo-3D environments and defeating enemies in turn-based combat. The only location in the game is the tower; there are no "friendly" areas and no possibility to acquire weapons, equipment, or items but by finding them in the tower or having them randomly dropped by enemies.</plot>

		<plot>In this sequel to Ikazuchi no Senshi Raidi, the fearless (and good-looking) female warrior Raidi is wandering through a desert. Finally she reaches a small town, only to discover that its inhabitants are being abducted by mysteriously looking creatures. The trace leads to an abandoned mansion not far away from the town. Armed with the power of lightning, Raidi steps into the mansion, hoping to unravel the mystery and to find the missing villagers.[CR]The sequel has the same core gameplay: explore huge maze-like pseudo-3D dungeons, fighting randomly appearing enemies (demonic, female, sexy, under-dressed) in turn-based combat. Raidi still fights alone in this sequel, without a party to aid her. There are, however, some additions: several dungeons instead of one, and a town where Raidi can rest and buy supplies. Just like the first game, encounters with enemies end in the enemies losing whatever clothes they still had on in the beginning of the fight.</plot>

		<plot>Indiana Jones is back! The great archaeologist and adventurer has to solve a grand mystery once again, aided by his trusty whip, his sharp wit, and his courage. A man who calls himself Mr. Smith is interested in a certain ancient statue. When the unsuspecting Indy hands it over to the client, he finds out that Mr. Smith is in fact a colonel in the Nazi army! Why was he so interested in that statue? A young woman who had once worked together with Indy, the pretty red-haired (and a bit troublesome) Sophia, tells him the whole thing must have a connection with the legendary lost continent Atlantis. Gathering clues from all over the world, Indy and Sophia embark on a grand journey across the globe.[CR][I]Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis[/I] is a puzzle-solving adventure game conceived in the spirit of [I]Indiana Jones[/I] movies; however, it is not based on a specific movie, introducing a new, independent story. The game utilizes LucasArts' SCUMM system, with action verbs the player chooses from a menu; objects that can be interacted with are highlighted. The game contains many puzzles of various kinds (mostly inventory-based) and dialogues with multiple choices. There are also a few simple hand-to-hand fights against the Nazis, some of which can be avoided.[CR]The middle part of the game can be played in three "modes": co-operation (Indy and Sophia), adventure (Indy alone), and action (Indy alone, with less puzzles and more action). In each mode there are different locations to visit, different puzzles to solve, and different characters to meet. The CD version of the game adds voice-overs to all the conversations.</plot>

		<plot>[I]Iris Tei Serenade[/I] is set in a medieval fantasy land. For seven years, the two most powerful countries - the Empire of Aimar and the Kingdom of Langbard - have been at war with each other. In order to secure the victory, the people of Aimar turned to Imar, their hero and guardian angel. Imar's mission is to infiltrate the Langbard kingdom. However, once he arrives there and stays at the inn run by three young and lovely sisters, his mind turns into a direction quite different from war and politics...[CR]The game is a traditional Japanese adventure, without puzzles, physical movement, or any interaction beside menu-based commands. The usual verb commands are the standard "Look", "Talk", "Think", and "Move", though other, context-specific command might appear on different screens as well. Most of the commands lead to sub-menus of objects. The player typically has to exhaust the command tree to trigger the next scene. At some points, the player can make decisions that will trigger different scenes.[CR]There are scenes with nudity and suggested sexual situations, though they are infrequent and rather "softcore".</plot>

		<plot>[I]Ishido[/I] is a solitaire board game played with tiles, similar to Shanghai. The objective is to place all of the tiles onto the board and obtain the highest possible score by following specific rules of play. There are ways to play that can dramatically increase the score, which makes the game very strategic in nature. Additionally, when desired, the player can get an oracle reading by asking a question, which is answered when the player makes a very elegant play (four-way match).[CR]There is also a "construction set" where players can create their own tiles and backgrounds. The game comes with numerous tile sets and backgrounds.</plot>

		<plot>[I]Ishin no Arashi[/I] is set during Bakumatsu period (around 1850 until the Meiji Restoration of 1867), the final stretch of the Japanese Edo period, which was a turbulent time, a time of great struggle between the supporters of the feudal shoguns, the rulers of the country, and the adherents of the Emperor, which eventually won and carried through the Meiji Restoration, turning Japan into a modern, powerful state. In [I]Ishin no Arashi[/I] the player can choose one of the three major battles of Bakumastu period, and decide which leader will eventually propel Japan towards the Meiji era.[CR]This strategy game is somewhat similar to the better-known Romance of the Three Kingdoms series and other historical simulation games by the same company, but also differs from them by having much less complex diplomacy options and focusing the gameplay on navigation and individual encounters. Before beginning, the player chooses a general and customizes his parameters (stamina, attack power, charisma, knowledge). The player then controls the general with soldiers of his choice, navigating him on grids representing towns and countryside of Japan in turn-based fashion. The grids can be occupied by shops, schools (to train the general), friendly and hostile characters and groups. Battles, as well as negotiations and diplomatic procedures, are carried out automatically, and their outcome depends on the characters' statistics.</plot>

Defeating a female mahjong opponent usually leads to cut scenes that depict nudity and sexual situations.</plot>

		<plot>[I]Joshi Kōsei Shōjo Hatsunetsu[/I] is an erotic game with digitized pictures of Japanese models posing as schoolgirls. The game consists of three modes. The first mode allows the player to view profiles and photos of twelve models (five photos per model). These photos are sexually suggestive, but contain no nudity. It is possible to interact with the pictures by moving a hand-shaped cursor over them.[CR]The second mode is a photo-shooting simulation game in which the player chooses one of the four available models as well as one of the several photographers, each with their own parameters. The session is timed and the photographer has to choose the right things to say in order to keep the girl in a good mood. Erotic photos (this time with partial nudity) can be then taken and saved to an album.[CR]The third mode is a simple sex simulation game. The player chooses between two young women, selects a few conditions for the sex scene, and then presses various keys to stimulate the woman. There is, however, no explicit sex situations in the game, the viewing area consisting only of a digitized photo of a semi- or fully nude woman.</plot>

		<plot>[I]Joshua[/I] is a grand strategy game set on the fictional semi-medieval continent of the same name. The people of Joshua are skilled in sciences and technology, which were used for good and evil purposes alike, leading to the invention of wondrous flying machines, but also mechanical war devices that allowed certain nations to take over large portions of the continent. The player can choose between any of the three scenarios, taking place during the fictional 10th to 12th centuries of Joshua's history. The earliest scenario puts the player in control of the small desert nation Rujua; in the middle one the ruler of the Principality of Ashumenia fights against the kingdom of Ishtakar; the final scenario takes place on a part of the continent occupied by the powerful Barm Empire, and the player must resist their invasion as the leader of the kingdom of Ans.[CR]The gameplay is similar to Koei's historical simulation games. Much of the interaction is menu-driven, as the player conducts interior policies, diplomacy, and military actions of the controlled state. As the ruler of a nation, the player has to keep the population happy, fortify cities, construct catapults for protection, train soldier, supply money and rations to the army, and engage in large-scale turn-based battles that take place on separate overhead screens.</plot>

The other eraser tools can be done with just a click of the mouse.[CR]- Alphabet and Rubber Stamps: Stamps can be placed with a click of the mouse using a library of art.[CR]- Truck Mover: Move part of the picture when the mouse is held down.[CR]- Undo Guy: Undoes the last thing the player did to the picture, and clicking on it again brings it back to where it was before the Undo.[CR]- Colour Picker: Clicking on a colour swatch will select that colour for use with drawing.[CR]The player can also record a voice for the picture if a microphone is plugged into the computer.</plot>

It adds 112 additional rubber stamps, colouring pages, 19 hidden pictures, “Draw Me!”, a video player, and a slide show creation tool.[CR]In SlideShow, the player can create picture presentations with transitions and recording custom audio if a microphone is plugged into the computer. In the Wacky TV, the player can watch video clips stored on the player’s computer, and can alter the picture by using the mixer tool. “Draw Me!” creates an idea from three humorous phrases, and puts the three sentences together to make a wacky drawing for the player to start off with. The coloring pages (known as “Color Me!”) are added in this edition to allow the player to colour in black and white drawings using the fill bucket tool. 112 rubber stamps are also included in this edition ranging from cartoon animals to everyday life.[CR]19 additional hidden pictures can be uncovered using the eraser tool, and is backwards compatible with an existing copy of Kid Pix’ hidden pictures library.</plot>

		<plot>Shizuni is a planet in the solar system of the star Vanas. The planet emits a glowing light. The humans have built a civilization there, similar to medieval Europe of our Earth. Whenever forces of darkness threaten the planet, it releases three shining orbs. These orbs choose their heroes, who would then join forces and defeat the evil. This time around, one of such heroes is Kanan, a young knight who has swore to serve his king. He must find the other heroes and save the planet, before it is once again controlled by the dark forces.[CR][I]Kigen: Kagayaki no Hasha[/I] is a traditional Japanese RPG with top-down world, randomly appearing enemies, simple leveling up system, etc. The battles are turn-based, with a slight twist: the game doesn't pause when the player selects battles commands, similarly to Final Fantasy games. The battles are set on auto, but it is possible to input precise commands at any time. The characters utilize physical attacks and techniques, which require technique points (TP).</plot>

Once there, the player is given new options, which includes leaving the tank commanders to follow their own judgment, or instruct them precisely where to move. A certain amount of time passes with each turn, and the player-controlled forces may be attacked by enemy tanks, planes, etc.</plot>

		<plot>As a knight, paladin, barbarian or sorceress, amass an army of creatures to take on the local baddies and search for the Sceptre of Order. A turn based game with a time limit that decreases depending on the skill level you play at.[CR]Depending on your allegiance, you will initially start with a different set of creatures, though the king will not mind whether you're his knight or barbarian. Game consists of four maps, each with more mean creatures to control and meaner opponents to fight, but acquiring those maps early will let you find and buy some mean creatures that will help you easily conquer prior maps.[CR]You can see all the enemies on the map and can literally clear the map of enemies, though random can appear in your castles if you leave them unprotected after the conquest. With each conquered castle (assuming the castle is occupied by the enemy you are currently after), you will get a level up, after first two level-ups king will promote you and you'll be able to recruit cavalries from the castle, after four more promotions you'll be able to recruit knights. All the other creatures are found outside the king's castle and can be recruited no matter the level, although your level determines the quantity of creatures you can find for recruitment, but take care of your money because if you don't have enough for your army's salary, they will desert or turn against you.[CR]There are also two artifacts per each map that will also uncover the map of the place holding the King's Sceptre. The moment you find the sceptre and bring it back to the king, the game will end even if you happen to find it very early in the game.[CR]As for tougher enemies, like the final one having hundreds of dragons and demons, they can also be defeated, but not by the army you can muster in one go. But when you're defeated, you respawn back at the king's castle and start with almost nothing but your money, however, the enemy in the castle will be left without those creatures lost in the battle, unless some of the new comes to aid him as every week the population increases.</plot>

		<plot>On a beautiful sunny day, King Graham of Daventry decides to take a stroll in the woods surrounding his castle. When he returns, he discovers with horror that his home, Daventry Castle, has completely disappeared! Graham is at a loss, and wonders how this could have happened, when a talking owl named Cedric appears. He tells him that he saw the whole thing, and that an evil wizard named Mordack whisked the entire castle away, along with Graham's family in it. Cedric offers to take him to his homeland, Serenia, where his master, the wizard Crispin resides. Surely Crispin will be able to help King Graham rescue his family from Mordack's clutches.[CR]King's Quest V: Absence Makes the Heart Go Yonder is an adventure game, and the first from Sierra to use a point-and-click mouse interface. Rather than typing commands on a keyboard to interact with the game world and use the arrow keys to walk around, King's Quest V instead simplifies all actions down to base commands. To access the different cursors, the player can move the mouse to the top of the screen, revealing a hidden menu with each of the different actions, as well as game options and the inventory bag. By clicking the "Walk" cursor on the screen, Graham will walk as close as he can to the appropriate area. Clicking the "Eye" cursor on items will provide a description, the same as typing "Look at". The "Hand" cursor is a multipurpose cursor that can be used to push, pull, interact with and pick up objects. The "Head" cursor is used to talk to people (and in the strange world of King's Quest, often objects and animals, too). Players can also right-click to cycle through the different available cursors. Inventory that Graham picks up now gets placed into a bag. By clicking on the bag, this opens up a sub-window that displays all the inventory that Graham currently has. In here, players can look at or interact with objects, combine them with other objects, or pick them up to use them in the game environment as another cursor.[CR]As with most Sierra games, it is quite possible to die. Bumping into witches, poisonous scorpions, falling off edges of cliffs, dying of thirst in the desert, and many other objects, locations and characters will send Graham to an untimely demise. The player must be cautious as they explore Serenia - frequent game saving across multiple files is usually the best course of action to make sure that you don't get stuck or have to start right from the game's very beginning.</plot>

		<plot>In the first part of this trilogy, Brandon, soon to be a king and only heir to the throne, determined to stop the evil jester Malcolm. Now, Kyrandia is disappearing. The high council found the cure for that - the anchor from the center of the world. When the young sorceress Zanthia comes to that anchor, she realizes it is not the answer. Her friend Marco is in possession of a giant hand, and it looks like that hand is responsible for the sabotage. Now, Zanthia must save Kyrandia before everything else vanishes without a trace.[CR]Hand of Fate is the second installment in the Kyrandia series. The gameplay is similar to that of the previous game. Interaction is possible only with highlighted objects on the screen, and is reduced to a single cursor, without the distinction of separate commands. There are also no branching dialogues. Many of the puzzles involve picking up ingredients and concocting magic spells out of them.</plot>

		<plot>The Dark Army is on the move again, led by the evil sorceress Scotia. Her goal is obvious: to destroy Gladstone Keep and its ruler King Richard. Scotia herself has recently become more powerful after acquiring "the Mask" from the Urban Mines, gaining the ability to shape-shift. She is virtually unstoppable and able to infiltrate Gladstone Keep, poisoning King Richard. If it were not for the intervention of Sorceress Dawn, the monarch would surely be dead. In order to find a cure for the King's illness, a band of heroes must set out on an adventure, and keep themselves alive from the Dark Army forces.[CR]Lands of Lore: Throne of Chaos is a real-time dungeon-crawling role-playing game viewed from a first-person perspective. Players begin by choosing one of the four available protagonists: the Dracoid Ak'shel (high magic power), the Huline Kieran (high speed), and two humans: Michael (high strength) and Conrad (balanced character). Each has his weaknesses and strengths, but all abilities in the game can be eventually upgraded.[CR]Much of the game consists of exploring pseudo-3D maze-like dungeons. Most of them contain secret areas and it is sometimes necessary to solve puzzles to advance. Real-time combat involves clicking on either the attack or magic icon for each character. Depending on their speed attribute they will need a certain amount of cooldown time before the player can activate them again. The point-and-click interface allows interaction with some background objects, sometimes eliciting comments from the protagonist or his companions.[CR]The game does not feature manual character development, introducing instead a semi-automatic form of leveling up, where skills of the hero and the companions are divided into Fighting, Magic and Rogue skills. Each skill level will increase when killing enemies using a particular type of attack: melee weapons increase the Fighting skills, magic increases the Magic skill, and ranged weapons increase the Rogue skills. In the course of the game players will form a party of up to three heroes in the quest for the cure. The player is able to equip these characters with new weapons and armor in a "paper doll" styled interface. The CD version includes full speech.</plot>

		<plot>The Earth has changed. We don't know yet what happened to humanity, but we know it was eradicated. The new Earth is called Makai - the Demon World. Generations of mythological creatures dwell upon the planet, from which the human being has mysteriously disappeared. One day, a wave of energy hits the Earth. The leaders of the demons realize that a robotic alien race from outer space threatens their existence. The explosion turns earth into a wasteland. Many demons die in the chaos of destruction. It is now up to the remaining demons to fend off the alien invaders, to bring back peace to the demonic race, and perhaps to find out more about the tragic fate of humanity.[CR][I]Last Armageddon[/I] can be described as a post-apocalyptic Final Fantasy. Instead of a party of four light warriors who fight hordes of demons, you have a party of four demons who fight... no, not hordes of light warriors, but mysterious robot-like aliens. The turn-based fights are viewed from third-person perspective and are very similar to the battles of early NES Final Fantasies. The demons can attack, cast offensive and defensive magic, and use special skills. Once they reach a high enough level, they morph into stronger forms with more powerful skills.[CR]Dungeon areas are done in pseudo-3D and are viewed from first-person perspective. The player is able to set and use multiple parties of demons, some of which have unique skills. For example, a flying demon can take the party quicker to some locations, avoiding random encounters.</plot>

		<plot>Last Survivor is one of the earliest 3D third-person shooters, it involves players traversing a maze shooting at opponents. The game consists of 20 levels and the goal is to collect four keys and then head towards the exit. There are 7 other human characters running around, in addition to various non-human enemies. Keys can be obtained by killing other players while non-human enemies drop gold, which can be used in the shop to purchase stronger weapons and armor as well as increase the player's moving speed or regain health.[CR]The player's character is rendered as a black wireframe and is viewed from behind. The screen is divided into halves (vertical split-screen), with two players being able to play on the same screen. Up to four arcade cabinets could be linked up, allowing eight players altogether, making it one of the first shooters with a network multiplayer deathmatch mode. The FM Towns port supports 4-players via serial crossover cable, or 2-players via direct dial modem.</plot>

		<plot>The Legend of Kyrandia is the first in a trilogy of adventure games by Westwood. In this game the player controls Brandon, grandson of Kallak - a wizard of the realm of Kyrandia. Malcolm, a psychotic jester imprisoned in the past by Kallak, has broken free and wishes to take over the land as well as lay down his revenge. He turns Kallak into stone leaving him with only his eyes, so that Kallak is not denied his tears for Kyrandia's sake.[CR]This is where Brandon steps in; returning home shortly afterwards only to find that his grandfather has been turned into stone, Brandon is being told by a messenger from the Realm of the Land that he has been chosen to embark on a journey that will rid this realm of Malcolm and his evil. He has to prove himself not only a hero, but a worthy heir to the crown and ultimately of becoming a king.[CR]Throughout the journey Brandon will collect many items and also learn how to master magic. Available spells include disappearing, healing yourself, summoning ice upon fire and shifting into a wisp. Interaction with the environment is confined to highlighted items, and a single cursor is used for all actions, without differentiating precise commands.</plot>

Along the bottom are a selection of functions which can be assigned to a Lemming, including climbing, floating and bashing. You must click to select the appropriate function, then click on the Lemming to activate it. Each level has a different range of skills on offer, a different amount of Lemmings, and a different percentage target in order to progress.</plot>

		<rom name="mame-merged/mame-merged/fmtowns.zip" size="3100000"/>
		<plot>The sequel to Lemmings has a plot describing how the Lemmings have split into 12 distinct tribes, each of which has their own landscape and their own cultural identity - they include Egyptian, Circus and Highland. However, Lemming Island is now in danger, and you must complete 10 levels for each tribe in order for them to reunite and reassemble the Talisman from the 12 pieces.[CR]Across the 120 levels there are over 60 skills, although no more than 10 are in use on each screen. The Classic tribe has the ones from the original and is perhaps the best option for first-time players.[CR]The others range from digging methods such as a scooper (diagonally downwards) and club basher (horizontal), building skills such as a planter (takes time to produce the desired raise to the landscape) and a sand pourer, and various methods of movement including a Pole-Vaulter and a Skater (the only Lemmings who can cross ice). Some of these are only subtly different to others, and their exact uses are unclear, but there are 4 Trainer levels where you can select any combination of skills and experiment.[CR]Unlike the first game, the player is rewarded for saving as many Lemmings as possible, rather than simply passing or failing. The ultimate aim is to save all 60 Lemmings through all levels, thereby earning a Gold Medal for that tribe - Silver and Bronze are also on offer. The player can also go back over levels in the hope of saving more Lems.[CR]Because there are 12 tribes, and the player can switch between them at any point, you have to be stuck 12 times in order to be unable to progress. The game saves progress rather than using passwords as in the first game.</plot>

Enemy encounters are semi-random: after every few steps small whirlwinds appear near the main character, which can be avoided or confronted to initiate combat.</plot>

		<plot>[I]Life and Death[/I] is a game which casts you as a doctor in a hospital. Your job is to diagnose patients and administer appropriate therapies, or even perform surgery when necessary.[CR]To diagnose a patient, you have to press on his or her abdomen, to see which portions of the stomach cause pain. Basing on this knowledge, you can choose a therapy for him (observation, medication or referring to another specialist) or administer a X-Ray or ultrasound scan to get more information about his illness.[CR]In some cases, surgery will be necessary. You're the surgeon and you have to perform the operation very carefully, adhering strictly to the procedures, preserving hygiene, and maintaining care when cutting up the patient.[CR]Should you mistakenly administer the wrong therapy, or kill your patient at the operating table, you're kicked into the medical school, where you're given hints as to what you've done wrong.</plot>

The sequel focuses on the brain, whereas the first game focused on the abdomen.[CR]The graphics and gameplay have been improved from the first game, but, other than the new patient cases, it plays more or less the same.</plot>

		<plot>This entry in the Lipstick Adventure series continues the story of the young private detective Gorou and his sweetheart Otomi. After attending a friend's marriage ceremony, they return to Gorou's office and find a strange package in the flowers. The package contains pictures of Otomi and several other girls, her schoolmates, some of them naked. Gorou heads to Otomi's high school to begin the investigation, without realizing that he will soon become involved in a sinister conspiracy...[CR][I]Lipstick Adventure 3[/I] plays similarly to its predecessors, having typical Japanese adventure gameplay with menu-based verb commands. The interface has been slightly tweaked, allowing easier "triggering" of events by eliminating some unnecessary commands.[CR]Like the previous games in the series, [I]Lipstick Adventure 3[/I] walks a fine line between adult and non-adult games, having graphical nudity and plenty of sexual innuendo, but no explicit sex scenes.</plot>

		<plot>A departure from other Lucasfilm adventure games in many senses, Loom is based on a serious and complex fantasy story. With its experimental interface, it eschewed the traditional paradigm of graphical adventures.[CR]Loom was redeveloped for the Japanese FM Towns computer and released on CD-ROM in 1991 with enhanced 256-color VGA graphics and a new digital soundtrack. The dialogue and story elements remained largely unchanged from the original version, though at least one scene was partially censored of blood and some elements of the visual design were lost.</plot>

		<plot>Like other Lunatic Dawn games, [I]Lunatic Dawn II[/I] is, despite its Japanese origins, an exploration-oriented Western-style RPG. There is no main story line in the game, beside the cryptic mentioning of a legendary group of heroes who fought demons and as a result became demons themselves in the introduction sequence. There are no "main goal"in the game, and no plot-advancing events; it is entirely dedicated to free-form exploration and role-playing.[CR]In the beginning, the player creates the main character (default name Lunatic), choosing gender and background - social status, strengths and weaknesses, etc. All this affects the parameters of the character, which include strength, stamina, weapon technique, charisma, etc.[CR]Like in the previous Lunatic Dawn game, the gameplay revolves around exploring the vast game world. The graphics are much more detailed in this installment, with actual locations within a city. There are more shops and places of interest to visit in each city, including the ruler's castle, as well as horse stables, where it is possible to buy a carriage to quickly transport to another city. It is possible to "call the master" in every location; some of the masters will join the main character. Also available for recruiting are various NPCs staying in the inn (a party can contain up to six characters). The NPCs have names and different abilities/parameters, but no distinct personalities. As before, there is a real day-by-day calendar in the game, and it is necessary to buy food rations for several days ahead if the player is planning a long journey. "Jobs" are available at the inns of various cities, which include treasure hunt, monster-eliminating, etc. The heroes get paid for completing those tasks.[CR]Roaming the top-down world map, the party can enter dungeons, which are viewed from an isometric perspective. Enemies are visible on the screen, and a turn-based battle initiates upon contact. The player can assign general strategies to the whole party, but is only able to control directly the main character. The party acts according to its AI, and the rest of the battle evolves automatically until the player interrupts it to input new commands.</plot>

		<plot>[I]Hong Kong no Mashu[/I] is based on the manga [I]Lupin the 3rd[/I] and is built like an episode in the series, assuming the player's familiarity with the characters. The central character is the grandson of the fictional "gentleman thief" Arsène Lupin, who follows the same profession, traveling in search of riches and adventure with his companion Daisuke Jigen, an expert marksman. Joining them in this episode is Goemon Ishikawa XIII, a descendant of the legendary Japanese swordsman. Finding themselves in Hong Kong for different reasons, the heroes encounter an evasive and mysterious character with a dark past who crosses their paths and forces them to take action.[CR]The game consists of two stories accessible from the main menu. In the first the player controls Jigen, while the protagonist of the second is Ishikawa. The game's structure resembles that of a visual novel: the gameplay is mostly restricted to selecting the right choice among several available ones. These decision prompts are fairly frequent, and making the wrong choice would sometimes lead to Game Over. In addition, in the beginning of each chapter the player must select three items from a list, which will become available as valid choices during correspondent scenes.</plot>

There were a few hundred SlaveGears aboard the war ship, and were to be put under the control. Under the intention of the ruling government in power. Two SlaveGears were put under the management of the police for the purpose of experimental use. These two models were named "Hound Dog" and "Rising Dog". The manned test of Hound Dog.

Rising Dog which had not yet been modified for manned use, also had started operations under the command of Omega. The research facilities were destroyed, and one SlaveGear disappeared into the city.

		<plot>The kingdom of Digal was the only peaceful country amidst chaos, ruled by the benevolent king Deneos and his wisest advisor, the High Priest. But the time of peace has come to an end when something strange happened to the king: seemingly controlled by an evil power, he banished the High Priest from the country. Digal plunged into chaos, crime began to flourish, bandits roamed the countryside uncontrolled.[CR]At this tough time, a young man named Rezas joined the Magic School, where the most beautiful and skillful female magicians were training at that time. But the next day, the school was attacked by a gang of criminals, and most of the people there killed. Rezas and his pretty schoolmates swear to avenge this crime and bring peace back to the kingdom.[CR][I]Madō Gakuen R[/I] is a mixture between Japanese-style RPG and turn-based strategy. There is free movement in towns, but the exploration is limited by restricting the player-controlled characters to a linear world map. Battles occur at pre-set locations, so instead of the usual dungeon exploration there are strategic battles, with turn-based movement on the battle screen. Characters attack physically or use healing, status-changing and offensive magic. The characters level up after successful disposal of an enemy.[CR]The game's adult content is present in some of the cutscenes, as well as during battles: female characters gradually lose pieces of clothes when sustaining damage.</plot>

		<plot>The goblin empire became more powerful than ever thanks to the charismatic king Gobligan, a human who united goblins under his rule. King Caudwener knew that the goblins began mass production of magical weapons. Assassinating Gobligan seemed the only option. Four warriors volunteer to infiltrate the goblin empire and carry out this dangerous task.[CR]Mahou Daisakusen (Sorcer Striker in the arcades) is a vertically scrolling shoot-em-up with a medieval fantasy theme mixed with modern weaponry and devices. The player can choose to control any of the four characters: fighter Gain, witch Chitta, reptile samurai Miyamoto, or necromancer Bornnam. Each of the characters flies through the stages and attacks with three types of main weapons, distinguished by color and taking different shapes depending on the chosen character: accurate homing fire (red), side weapons (blue), powerful straight attack (green). The weapons are changed by collecting magic books, and their power is enhanced by flying over coins that appear on the stages.</plot>

		<plot>[I]Mandala Keichizoku[/I] is a mahjong game that includes two modes of play: story and versus. The story mode puts the player in the role of a brave warrior named Shou, who ventures towards the mysterious tower, the kingdom's most sacred site; there, he encounters a cute female android who tells him that he will have to compete against various magical creatures in the game of mahjong if he wishes to obtain the treasure hidden within the tower. The player proceeds to face various female opponents in a pre-set order; in the versus mode, the player is free to choose the opponents. Winning mahjong games leads to erotic scenes featuring the opponents.</plot>

		<plot>The idea of this arcade game is deceptively simple: Guide a marble down a path without hitting any obstacles or straying off the course. The game is viewed from an isometric perspective, which makes it harder to stay focused on the direction the ball is to follow. There are tight corridors to follow and enemies to avoid. There is a 2-player mode in which players must race to the finish; otherwise you're racing against the clock.</plot>

		<plot>[I]Marionette Mind[/I] is a collection of three interrelated short stories depicting the adventures of an artificially created young woman. Each story is told and seen from the point of view of a different protagonist. In the first story, a young puppet-maker creates a doll of a young woman that becomes miraculously alive, and very soon discovers her sexuality. In the second story, she helps a broke performer in a puppet theater to improve his business and life. The third story is dedicated to battle puppets known as "kugutsu", where the artificial woman finally finds her home.[CR]The gameplay in the three stories is identical, and contains very little interaction. The player is typically presented with a number of choices on most screens, but only one of them usually leads to the continuation of the story. Despite its visual novel-like structure, there are no different outcomes to the stories available.</plot>

		<plot>First you choose one out of four different characters to represent you, Scarlet (red army), Oberon (yellow army), Caesar (green army), or Madcap (blue army). The game is split into 10 levels - the first 9 are groups of 3 territories which can be completed in any order, while the final 'Mother of All Battles' has its own surprises.[CR]Land is mostly of sand, grass or ice. You start with 100 men and you can use whatever quantity you find necessary on each island. The rest men left will go to another level with another new 100. In the second half of the game you can freeze men to save them for the Mother of All Battles.[CR] [CR]Once you select your island and place for your HQ, you must do some research for better weapons and defences. On the roof of your buildings you can put protectors like archers, gunmen, boiling oil men, and later on even laser turrets. If you send a team of unarmed men into an unoccupied square, they will build an additional base there, with larger armies completing this more quickly.[CR]Later on higher levels, you'll also build mines and factories, as you'll need to dig a certain material for higher level weapons, depending on whether the area you're on is rich with a certain material or not. With each next level, you'll start from a higher technology level and be able to progress to one higher level up than at the previous level.[CR]If there is more then just one enemy, you can make an alliance until you crush the other one - three of you can form an alliance against fourth enemy. For what its worth, a certain numeric level of defence is always stronger from the same level of attacker, and men that are not armed (conscripts) can only kill enemy soldiers, not destroy or attack enemy fort.[CR]The main thing as always in strategy games is to be the sole survivor and lead your men to victory, experimenting on vicious technologies, equipping your men, making perfect soldiers out of them, produce shields, weapons, planes... to dominate the world and crush your opponents.[CR]You can do the battling only in a certain quadrant, but don't be long as your men will automatically start building the fort, and it will be at the bottom of age level and you'll need to invent everything for that one again.</plot>

		<plot>In Metal Eye, the player takes the role of a young weapons expert named Findhill. His father was apparently involved in a project that dealt with creating artificial life forms. But recently he has disappeared without a trace. Findhill remained alone, in a small town surrounded by vicious monsters. He wants to become a hunter, just like his father once was, to get rid of the monsters roaming the wilderness, and get to the bottom of his father's disappearance and his mysterious project.[CR]The game is a rather traditional Japanese RPG: Findhill and his companions, who join the party as dictated by the course of the story, wander around a vast world map, visiting towns, descending into dungeons, and fighting random enemies in turn-based combat viewed from a first-person perspective. The party can carry different types of weapons, including various guns (rifles, shotguns, etc.) with expendable bullets. Weapons and armor are shared by all the characters and need not be equipped on individual combatants. The player can also purchase robotic fighters (called "Metals" in the game) in shops, who would then join the party and participate in battles, controlled by the AI. There are scenes with nudity and sexual situations in the game.</plot>

		<plot>Metal Eye 2 is set in the same sci-fi universe and is closely related story-wise to the first game. In the future, people have built the floating city Zeron, where the best scientists work on creating androids, artificial human beings who look the same way as real ones. Harvest Corporation is the biggest company that creates androids. The hero of the game is a scientist named Wirg, the father of the first game's protagonist. His work is to train the androids after they have been created. One day, the company building is attacked, and Wirg has to escape. He is saved by a nun and brought into a small town in the middle of wasteland, where his adventure begins.[CR]The game mostly follows a traditional Japanese RPG template: Wirg and his companions (a party of three) explore the top-down world and fight random enemies in turn-based combat in first-person view. The pictures of enemies appear super-imposed on whatever location the characters are currently in, without separate battle screens. The towns have isometric perspective. Like its predecessor, the game has a large world map that consists of many separate screens, often including dungeon-like locations.</plot>

		<plot>In the year 2051, two mega corporations battle it out for supremacy over an overcrowded, overpolluted planet. CyberTech Industries, the dominant company on the planet, is being challenged by Axiom, who blames the former for their president's death. To gain revenge, they secretly inject CyberTech's president, Anton Korsby, with a virus that threatens to take over his body, and ultimately destroy himself and CyberTech. Your mission is to enter Korsby's body, destroy the virus, and defeat the organism that controls his brain.[CR]Microcosm is a 3D action shooter that takes place entirely within the human body. The concept was inspired by the 1966 movie Fantastic Voyage. The player pilots his way through various parts of the anatomy, blasting virii and enemy ships, while gaining power-ups and faster, stronger craft. The goal of the game is to eventually reach the brain to stop Grey M, the entity that controls Korsby's body.[CR]Microcosm makes heavy use of full-motion video and features high-resolution fractal graphics (to simulate the walls of veins and arteries), digital music and sound effects.</plot>

The brave adventurers tried to pursue him on his journey through space, but were unable to reach the destination. Meanwhile, the distant world of Xeen is experiencing new troubles. A mysterious villain known as Lord Xeen has imprisoned Crodo, the local oversees, and is plotting to execute control over the land. A band of local adventurers becomes involved in the conflict and get to the bottom of the mystery.[CR][I]Clouds of Xeen[/I] is the fourth installment in the Might and Magic series, and a follow-up to Isles of Terra. It utilizes the same graphics and interface as its predecessor, and is generally very similar to it in structure and gameplay. Among new features is the possibility to keep notes recording quests and important locations in the game, a separate inventory section for quest items, and two difficulty levels.[CR]All over the game's world there are pyramids which work as teleporters as soon as part five of the series, Darkside of Xeen is installed. The two games can be played simultaneously, merging into World of Xeen, which includes multiple cross-over quests in both installments.</plot>

		<plot>Following the trail of Prince Roland, six brave adventurers venture into the Darkside, the other side of the world Xeen. There, a mysterious person who calls himself Lord Alamar has defeated the local queen and usurped her throne. Allies of the Dragon Pharaoh, the Guardian of Darkside, have either joined Alamar or perished in their resistance. The Guardian bestows his powers upon the adventurers, who must liberate Xeen and eventually help the space traveler Corak to finally destroy the corrupt Guardian Sheltem for good.[CR][I]Darkside of Xeen[/I] is the fifth installment of the Might and Magic, a direct sequel to Clouds of Xeen, and a completion of the overarching story arc that started in the first game. The game uses the same engine and interface as Might and Magic III: Isles of Terra, and is nearly identical to its immediate predecessor gameplay-wise. Compared to earlier games, it has a darker and somewhat more bizarre setting, and dungeon exploration involves more puzzle-solving. It is also more plot-focused and has a larger number of cutscenes.[CR]All over the game's world there are pyramids which work as teleporters as soon as part five of the series, Darkside of Xeen is installed. The two games can be played simultaneously, merging into World of Xeen, which includes multiple cross-over quests in both installments.</plot>

		<plot>A party of brave heroes managed to defeat the corrupted guardian Sheltem as he attempted to destroy the world of CRON. However, the great battle between the guardians Corak and Sheltem continued in another place - the world of Terra, where Sheltem was originally appointed as a guardian. Revolting against the powerful race of the Ancients, Sheltem takes possession of their space-traveling nacelles, hurling them at the suns of other planets. It is now up to a group of local adventurers to help Corak and vanquish Sheltem once and for all.[CR]Isles of Terra is the third installment in the Might and Magic series, and a sequel to Gates to Another World. Like its predecessors, it is a role-playing game focusing on first-person exploration of vast pseudo-3D environments, character building, and turn-based combat. The five selectable races remain the same as in the previous games, as well as the eight character classes with the addition of two new ones: Druid and Ranger. Like in the second game, characters may learn unique skills such as thievery, swimming, merchant, and others.[CR]This installment does away with random or pre-set enemy encounters, featuring instead enemies dynamically roaming the game world, allowing to initiate combat from a distance (for example with ranged attacks or spells). There is no option to bribe or surrender to enemies, and escaping combat can be accomplished simply by moving away, unless the enemies have already locked on the party. An automap feature is available at all times, and the player is also allowed to save the game at any time.</plot>

		<plot>It happened long time ago, when mankind possessed the secrets of magic. One time, when a comet was approaching the Earth, a young woman gave birth to a baby. He was taken into the nearby village and grew up there. But he knew he was different from other children: he could not use magic, and on his hand there was a little star. He believed that he was cursed, and so did many people in his village. He learns that the ominous cave in the Northern Mountain might hold the answers to his questions. He embarks on this journey, determined to find out the identity of his father and his true role in the world.[CR][I]Mirage[/I] is essentially a dungeon crawler: the biggest portion of the game is spent navigating pseudo-3D maze-like dungeons (auto-mapped), fighting random enemies in turn-based combat. The hero is accompanied by another character, and both participate in combat. With time the hero and his companion learn magical spells. Dungeons also contain areas where weapons and items can be purchased.[CR]The game contains scenes with nudity and erotic images (though nothing "hardcore"). Many of the random enemies are pretty female demons, who disrobe when defeated.</plot>

		<plot>Hyper Classic Operation is a turn-based sci-fi strategy game focusing entirely on battles between the Earth Federation and Zeon. The game has two campaigns, 0079 and 0087, corresponding to the years in which two major wars of the Gundam universe took place: the first war against the Principality of Zeon and the conflict between various factions (including the Axis Zeon, the first of the Neo Zeon organizations) eight years later. The player can either go through the battles of each campaign in a linear fashion (Campaign Mode), or choose between different battles (Scenario Mode); the latter includes two-player gameplay as well.[CR]The player may assign and customize various pilots before each battle. The battles themselves are predominantly tactical, consisting mainly of navigation and attacking, without resource management. Units may consist of space ships, infantry, droids, mechas, etc. An automatic battle between two units ensues when any of them chooses to attack the other. There are also light role-playing elements such as levels for individual units.</plot>

		<plot>Hyper Desert Operation can be considered a "twin game" of Mobile Suit Gundam: Hyper Classic Operation. It is nearly identical to the other game in setting, gameplay, and visuals. Like Hyper Classic Operation, the game consists of two major campaigns, 0079 and 0087, corresponding to two famous wars in Gundam universe. The player can once again choose between a linear progression through a campaign and individual scenarios within each.[CR]The scenarios themselves, however, are completely different. Unlike Hyper Classic Operation, all the scenarios take place on planet surfaces rather than in space. As the title suggests, desert terrain plays indeed an important role; however, some of the scenarios are set in grassland areas, sometimes surrounded by water, etc. The game also features different unit types and places a stronger emphasis on base defense and management.</plot>

		<plot>Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge - Special Edition is a remake of Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge. After the events of The Secret of Monkey Island Guybrush came to fame but it is fading away. Now he is on the search for the famous treasure of Big Whoop. Unfortunately he is stuck on Scabb Island where Largo LaGrande, a former henchman of LeChuck, is in charge and steals all of Guybrush's riches... His first goal is to leave Scabb Island and later his search for Big Whoop gets more personal because an old enemy comes back to life... Regarding gameplay the game doesn't change much in comparison to its predecessor: the player explores the environment, solves item-based puzzles and talks to a lot of people through multiple choice dialogues. The biggest part of the game is the search for a treasure map during which the player has to solve interconnected puzzles on three islands. The three main new features of this Special Edition are the all-new graphics, full voice acting (this time also available while playing with the original graphics) and new controls similar to the coin control of The Curse of Monkey Island: when right clicking on an object all valid verbs pop up. Optionally the player can circle through the verbs to change the default command for the left mouse button. Of course he can always switch to the original version where he has the original SCUMM-Interface available with nine verbs at the bottom of the screen. To start an action the player has to choose one of these verbs and then click on an item in the game world or the inventory. New players who are not familiar with the original game can use two features to make their life easier: a hint system and the possibility to lighten up all interactive elements on the screen. On the other hand the "easy" mode from the original game is not included. The optional in-game commentary by Ron Gilbert, Tim Schafer and Dave Grossman can be activated during certain scenes of the game and gives background information about the development of the original game.</plot>

		<plot>After a prolonged absence due to mental problems, Kuon, a young heir to a dynasty of powerful oligarchs, returns to his mansion. He is greeted by his wife, his associates, his servants, and other people who live in the huge family estate. Kuon has to continue the political work of his predecessors, but he is more interested in exploring sexual desires - his own and those of other people. But each "experiment" reveals more of Kuon's troubled past, and he will have to fight his childhood traumas and determine himself the limits of what he can allow himself to do...[CR][I]Mūgen Hōyō[/I] is a visual novel with multiple choices and plot lines. It takes place entirely in the mansion, and follows Kuon's life on a daily basis. The player has to decide for Kuon what to do - dedicate his attention to his work, or go to different rooms in the mansion to trigger scenes. On many occasions the player will also be able to choose sexual activities, sometimes having very specific choices. Decisions lead to different paths in the story, including not only different sex scenes, but also varied endings and glimpses into Kuon's past.</plot>

		<plot>[I]Mujintō Monogatari[/I] is a self-described "survival life simulation". A plane crashes into the sea, but the protagonist survives and reaches a seemingly deserted island. The protagonist finds a cabin with a few basic supplies. From that point on, the player has to manage the hero's activities. Water, food and light sources have to be provided. The protagonist can team up with other survivors and explore the island, gradually revealing new locations; this can be done in co-operative mode. Expeditions to other places take place automatically, and must be planned in advance by the player. The protagonist's statistics (stamina, speed, etc.) will change depending on the activities chosen by the player.</plot>

		<plot>A young woman named Ryouko is working in a research laboratory specializing in communication with aquatic animals. Recently she has made groundbreaking discoveries with one of the test subjects, a whale named Gigi. Ryouko managed to establish full communication with the animal and teach him information. However, other people involved in the project have their own ideas concerning the practical usage of the whale's intelligence, and are ready to use it to further their own shady agendas.[CR][I]My Eyes![/I] plays similarly to visual novels, albeit with many more choices and interaction than it is usually the case with games of its type. There are no permanent menus and only a few instances where navigation is possible; however, the player is often presented with several context-specific commands and choices in each situation. Often it is necessary to go through commands multiple times to trigger the next events; sometimes wrong choices lead to Game Over.</plot>

		<plot>[I]Necronomicon[/I] is - as the title strongly implies - based on the writings of H.P. Lovecraft. The story is set in Lovecraft's fictional city Arkham somewhere in New England. It is said that a terrible ritual has taken place there, involving a woman giving birth to a demonic child. A journalist named Jonathan heads to Arkham to find out more about the dreadful rumors, and to explore the ruins of an ancient monastery. In the town, Jonathan meets other characters with their own agendas. Terrifying nightmares, like visions from the past, haunt Jonathan. Will he be able to preserve his sanity and solve the mystery?[CR][I]Necronomicon[/I] plays like a traditional Japanese-style adventure, having no puzzles at all (even though there is a rudimentary inventory in the game). However, unlike most Japanese adventures, it uses a simple point-and-click interface for interaction. Navigation is done either through a menu command, or by selecting a location on the map of Arkham.[CR]Despite the game's connection to Lovecraft stories, its graphics are distinctly Japanese, mostly following anime-manga-style aesthetics. There are disturbing scenes in the game, as well as scenes with nudity.</plot>

		<plot>One day, a kiwi tribe was having fun and games outside the zoo, only to be kidnapped by the evil-minded Leopard Seal, who plans to sell them at the black market. Fortunately, during the kidnapping process, Tiki, leader of the tribe, managed to escape the sack, and her job is to rescue Phee-Phee and the other kiwis scattered around New Zealand, and are held in cages in various locations that include Auckland, Rotorua, Waitomo Caves, Strait Cook, and Mt. Cook.[CR]If Tiki doesn't rescue a kiwi in a limited amount of time, the devil will appear and try to kill her. When Tiki reaches the outskirts of each city, except Strait Cook, there is a boss waiting to meet Tiki, and kill her by using their own choice of weapons. Also making the rescue mission difficult are several nasties that attempt to throw their own weapons, like bombs and arrows, at her. To defeat these enemies, Tiki shoots at them using her crossbow and arrows. More often than not, when Tiki shoots at enemies, they will leave behind pieces of fruit that she can pick up for points. However, it is likely that Tiki may get other weapons or the letters E, X, T, E, N, and D. Collecting all these letters will result in an extra life, and as for the weapons, they include laser shots, bombs, and fireballs.[CR]In some levels, a few areas are located further up than just left or right, and the only way that Tiki can go up is by snatching something off the enemy that gives her the ability to fly up. Other areas are underwater, and when Tiki goes underwater, her oxygen meter decreases, so she has to rise up to the surface again to restore her oxygen levels. Apart from her own weapons, Tiki is able to squirt water at enemies if she gets to the top of the water.</plot>

		<plot>The day began with great news: the genius scientist Dr. Cooger phoned his friend, a young man named Cole, and told him that he has, in fact, invented a medicine that resurrects living beings! So, where's the catch? Well, there seems to be a tiny problem... the resurrected creature turns into a wild, murderous zombie! After such a "resurrection" (performed on a poor policeman), the great scientist and his buddy escape to the cemetery, where they accidentally drop the vial with the resurrection medicine...[CR][I]Dead of the Brain[/I] is a horror adventure game. Most of the time in the game is spent controlling Cole, exploring zombie-infested buildings and trying to survive. The interaction with the environment is performed by selecting verb commands, always available as an interface ( Look, Talk, Move, Get, Use, and Go!), and then clicking on the appropriate object/person on the screen. Though absence of real puzzles makes the game a Japanese-style adventure, the interactivity is higher than normally in games of this genre. The game also features timed tasks, when the player has to figure out quickly what to do before the heroes are killed by a zombie.</plot>

		<plot>Ningyō Tsukai is the game that was the basis for Metal and Lace: The Battle of the Robo Babes, but the original is quite different. It is a straightforward fighting game with no power-ups or strategy elements. The player controls a female robot named Mimi and has to beat six opponents, who are supposed to be robots and beautiful young women at the same time, in three rounds each. After each successful round, a picture of the opponent in increasing state of undress is displayed. If the player loses the battle, it is instead the protagonist who gets undressed.</plot>

		<plot>A Japanese teenager named Hiroki is interested in martial arts, and has to take care of his little sister. Their older brother Yoichi had gone abroad; just when he announced that he was coming back he disappeared under mysterious circumstances. Hiroki and his friends eventually find out that an international supernatural criminal syndicate is in cohorts with an even darker power that is about to bring the apocalypse onto Earth.[CR][I]Only You[/I] can be considered a hybrid of RPG and visual novel-like adventure with choices that affect the storyline and the hero's relationship with various female characters. Locations are represented as still anime-style images, and all the interaction is done with menu commands. Much of the gameplay is dedicated to selecting locations from a city map and triggering extended cutscenes.[CR]The RPG elements are present in scripted and random one-on-one turn-based battles, during which Hiroki and his opponent exchange various types of physical and special attacks until one of them is defeated. The protagonist gains experience points from battles and levels up. There are no equipment or usable items in the game. Traveling to locations and resting deplete a special counter; when it reaches zero, the apocalypse is triggered and the game is over. It is necessary to battle the antagonists and advance the plot in order to reset the counter.</plot>

		<plot>You have been recruited for Operation Wolf, a desperate attempt to rescue prisoners from the enemy. Through a series of missions, you'll engage a variety of enemies, from soldiers to ninjas, patrol boats to helicopters, and more. Can you carry the day?[CR][I]Operation Wolf[/I] is an arcade game by Taito. It is essentially a bitmapped "rail-shooter", where you basically hold the gun and shoot just about everything that moves, while conserving your ammo and grenades. Shoot ammo/grenades and healing items on the screen to "pick them up". Your primary machine gun can kill everything if you hit it enough times, but you can also use the grenade launcher for really deadly targets like helicopters or armored cars. You can collect a machine gun which will allow you to shoot faster for a few seconds.[CR]You'll be pummelled by a LOT of enemies. Some will be shooting, others will be tossing grenades, knifes, and more. Some are armored and requires more than a few hits, others dodges. You can shoot grenades and knifes out of the air if you aim well enough. There are also civilians running around which can be shot, but it's not beneficial.[CR]Bosses appear at the end of some levels, and each has a specific weakness you need to exploit.</plot>

		<plot>The goal of Palamedes is to clear the screen which is, line by line, filling up with dice. Players control a small person situated near the bottom of the screen, who can only be moved to the left or right. The number of the dice the person is holding can be changed with the B button, pressing the A button will shoot the dice upwards. If the die hits another one with a matching number, the targeted dice disappears from the playing area and is added to a column at the bottom of the screen. Pressing down after lining up at least three dice of either the same number or consecutive numbers in the bottom row will destroy up to five lines at once.[CR]There are three modes of play: The standard single player mode, which requires the player to destroy a set number of lines in order to advance to the next stage; a tournament mode in which the player has to duel a number of CPU-controlled opponents and a two player mode.</plot>

		<plot>In the future, mankind successfully colonized Mars. However, the colonists eventually wished to be independent from Earth's control, and as a result a war began. Martian colonists used armored combat androids in battles. Eventually an uneasy truce was achieved, but Martian economy was badly damaged by war, and the planet became de facto dependent on Earth to survive.[CR]Half a year later, a young Tokyo-based private investigator named Ryūichi and his assistant, the android Leyla, are contacted by the colonel of the former colonial army of Mars. It appears that someone has stolen documents containing top military secrets and disappeared with them. Ryūichi is asked to find that man, whom he knew quite well during the years of war...[CR]Phobos is a Japanese-style adventure game. Every scene requires the player to select verb-object combination commands from a menu to examine locations, talk to people, and obtain information. Once the protagonist learns of a new location is becomes available in the menu. The player is usually free to visit all known locations and repeat conversations while searching for clues. Some scenes contain explicit erotic images.</plot>

		<plot>The discovery of an alien craft entering our solar system causes quite a stir. When the small craft is accidentally fired upon, it creates a strange electromagnetic effect that envelops the Earth, causing it to disappear. While its gravity remains, the physical Earth simply isn't there. The moonbase, surviving on scrounged resources and manpower, builds an interstellar ship. A team of four specialists is then sent into deep space to find unique parts for the construction of the Centauri Drive, a machine that the moonbase scientists hope will cause a reverse effect.[CR]Planet's Edge is a sci-fi role-playing game with space exploration and other gameplay elements, including spaceship combat, mining for resources, trading, and light puzzle-solving. The game begins on the moonbase, where the player can access the shipyard, crew quarters, warehouse, and research lab. The player is put in control of four pre-made characters: William Dean (pilot), Katya Mershova (weapons officer), Nelson Ngatadatu (engineer), and Osai Tsakafuchi (medic) . Each of these characters can be cloned for different attribute rolls, while retaining their primary skills: astrogation and ship weapons for William; light, heavy, and hand weapons for Katya; ship repair and computers for Nelson; and first aid and xenobiology for Osai. Unlike most role-playing games, characters do not receive experience points and can only become stronger by equipping better weapons and armor.[CR]The game is completely open-ended, allowing the player to travel to any of the dozens of stars. The player physically navigates the ship on an overhead screen. Entering a star system enlarges the view, allowing the ship to orbit a planet. Though most planets cannot be landed on, a large amount remains that can be explored on foot from a top-down view similar to that of Ultima VI. Each planet is represented by an enclosed populated area, usually containing friendly NPCs as well as enemies. Advancing the storyline involves gathering clues from various characters as well as obtaining objects, many of which have to be used in other locations in a puzzle-like fashion. Combat on the ground is turn-based and can be avoided in most cases.[CR]Planets can also be mined for various elements such as organics, metals, liquids, etc. These elements can be then brought back to the moonbase, where they can be used to produce better equipment for the crew members or upgrade the spaceship. Alien technological blueprints can also be recovered and used in the research laboratory to develop new ship models. The spaceship can carry cargo between planets, which can be traded or used to bribe hostile aliens. If the bribe is unsuccessful or the player decides not to resort to it, a fight against a hostile ship ensues. These fights are action-based, requiring the player to manoeuvre the ship in real time while shooting at the opponent.</plot>

		<plot>[I]Ponkan[/I] consists of three unrelated scenarios. In the first one a young private investigator attempts to unravel a sex-related conspiracy. The second scenario is set in medieval fantasy environment and focuses on two warrior sisters who got captured and thrown into a dungeon by monsters. Finally, the third scenario is dedicated to "sex fighting" between young women of various cultural backgrounds.[CR]The gameplay is the same in all the scenarios, approaching the visual novel format, though with more choices than it is usually the case with comparable games. Rather than branching the storyline the choices serve simply to trigger new options and subsequently cutscenes, though some may lead to a premature end of the game.[CR]The game largely consists of explicit sex scenes. A comic book-like behind-the-stage segment, extended introductions to other products by the same developer, and various art galleries are included.</plot>

		<plot>In the year 2535 the planet Omni declared independence from Earth. This decision was met by harsh repressions carried out by the Terran government. In response, Omni scientists managed to convert a device known as Power Loader (PLD) into combat mechas. Five years later, the 177th squadron was formed, consisting of an all-female team named DoLLS (Detachment of Limited Line Service).[CR][I]Power Dolls[/I] is a turn-based strategy game in which the player takes role of a commander of an all-female military group manning giant mechanized battlesuits in a series of nine missions, with objectives ranging from destroying convoys to stalling enemy advance to rescuing captured military personnel.[CR]Squads for each mission can be assembled from a total of twenty-one pilots, seven variants of mechanized battle armor (which can be armed with sixteen types of weaponry), four types of aircraft ranging from transport carriers to fighter-bombers and artillery units.[CR]Several different battle plans can be chosen for most of the missions. The differences between these may range anywhere from a slight change of the deployment time up to and including a complete change of mission strategy.[CR]Successfully completing a mission unlocks bonus piece of artwork depicting one of the women piloting the mechs ingame. There are nine of these graphics in total, one for each mission.</plot>

		<plot>[I]Power Dolls 2[/I] is a turn-based mecha-themed tactical game set in a futuristic scenario of the 26th century. Like its predecessor, the game focuses on the war between the planets Omni and Earth. The player commands the all-female Detachment Of Limited Line Service ("Dolls") squad and can opt for going through the campaign in a linear fashion or directly select specific missions from the main menu.[CR]The gameplay is very similar to that of the previous game, with some interface-related and customization additions (such as more detailed ways to outfit mechas). The player must build a team out of several available pilots, assigning a mecha or another type of craft (plane, mobile rocket-launcher, etc.) depending on the type of mission and its requirements. The player then proceeds to the actual mission, navigating squad members in turn-based fashion through a top-down area. Like in the first game, tactical considerations (pre-mission choices, positioning of team members, etc.) sometimes carry more weight than actual armed confrontations with the enemy.</plot>

		<plot>[I]PowerMonger[/I] takes the basic design and concepts of Bullfrog's previous game Populous, and places it in a war context. The game cast the player as a dispossessed warlord plundering his way through 195 territories on the way to world conquest. Several other leaders have the same goal.[CR]The gameworld is now made up of polygons, so the view can be rotated and moved with greater freedom than Populous. Trade, diplomacy, inventions, and scorched earth invasions all play a key role in how the player progresses through the game. Two-player games via modem links are available on computer versions.</plot>

		<plot>While the Sultan of Persia is fighting a war in a foreign country, his Grand Vizier Jaffar orchestrates a coup d'état. His way to the throne lies through the Sultan's lovely daughter. Jaffar kidnaps her and threatens to kill her if she refuses to marry him. Meanwhile, the man the Princess loves is thrown into the dungeon. He has only one hour to escape from his prison, defeat the guards on his way, and stop Jaffar before the terrible marriage takes place.[CR]Prince of Persia is a 2D platformer that is commonly regarded as a progenitor of the cinematic platform genre. Rather than following the more common jump-and-run mechanics, it focuses on careful advancement through fairly complex levels, emphasizing the protagonist's vulnerability and survival aspect. Rotoscoping technique is used to give more realism to the animation of the characters' movements.[CR]The protagonist must avoid deadly traps, solve some simple jumping and environmental puzzles (such as stepping on pressure plates to raise portcullis), and engage in sword fights with the guards. The player character has an infinite amount of lives, but has to restart at the beginning of a level each time he dies, and must complete the game within an hour. The hero starts with three units of health, which can be replenished with small health potions or permanently increased with large jars.[CR]The Game Boy Color and SNES versions of the game feature additional levels and new enemies. The Genesis version has a new intro, an altered set of graphics and four new levels.</plot>

		<plot>After having defeated the evil Grand Vizier Jaffar, the brave Prince claimed just one reward: the hand of the beautiful daughter of the Persian Sultan. However, as the Prince approached the palace, his appearance suddenly turned into that of a beggar. Someone who looked just like the Prince ordered to throw him out. It turns out that Jaffar is alive and back for vengeance. Banished from the palace, the unfortunately Prince must travel to faraway lands and find a way to defeat the villain.[CR][I]Prince of Persia 2[/I] is, like its predecessor, a cinematic platformer. Much of the gameplay is reminiscent of the first game, focusing on precise jumping puzzles, swordfighting, and overcoming many hazards in order to stay alive. Swordfighting is more prominent and features situations where several enemies attack the Prince at once. Reinforcements may arrive after the Prince has eliminated all visible enemies. Like its predecessor, the game must be completed within a time limit.</plot>

		<plot>A hero saved the human race from utter annihilation by the gods. This same hero then was charged by the heavens to take care of young seed dropped from there. This seed becomes his daughter, and her guardian will be watching her progress.[CR]In Princess Maker 2 the player assumes the role of a father to the blessed daughter of the heavens. For the next eight years, the hero will nurture and guide her in the path of the player's own choosing.[CR]It is possible to choose the path of the zodiac-influenced daughter by scheduling her to jobs and schools, which will raise her statistics (strength, combat skills, cooking, faith, etc.) Each month allows the player to designate three different tasks for her to follow. Balancing between character development, stress level, health and financial income is the focus of this game.[CR]Mini sub-quests and various plot options revolve around the young lady adventuring in the wilderness, provided that she's strong enough to tame the wilds. The player can equip her with armor and weapons to fight off wandering random monsters in turn-based combat.[CR]The game starts with the daughter at age ten, from which point the player guides her until her adult years. Choices made during the course of the game will determine her eventual marital status, accomplishments and her relationships with other people. There are 74 unique endings in the game.</plot>

		<plot>By the end of the 20th century, radical educational reforms have transformed the Japanese society. Students were split into opposing groups, and the more aggressive of those eventually formed a dominant organization named Order of Black Phoenix, centered on the cult of a mysterious person known as "The Queen". Outcast students have escaped to a secluded island near Okinawa. A wandering lazy and lecherous manga and anime fan named Gorō Endō teams up with a female teacher and a few students to lead an opposition force against the oppressive governing circles.[CR][I]Pro Student G[/I] is a Japanese-style erotic comedy adventure. The player guides Gorō through a series of locations and encounters, selecting choices from a menu to trigger the next event and advance the story. Some choices have a traditional verb-object structure, while others incorporate context-specific actions, many of which are included for humorous effect.</plot>

		<plot>The Kingdom of Faladia has been enjoying an era of peace and prosperity for a long while. However, it all came to an abrupt end when a neighboring country treacherously broke a peace agreement and attacked the capital city. The king asks an Alfa Knight named Romeo to escort his daughter to a safe passage, but war interrupts the gathering. Romeo finds himself in a coastal town, rescued by a nun named Maria, who agrees to accompany him on a quest to find the princess and fulfill the wishes of his sovereign.[CR][I]Provvidenza[/I] is a traditional Japanese-style role-playing game. Unlike other RPGs by Kinpukurin, it does not feature the trademark dialogue and party-recruiting system. Instead, it follows the simpler, more basic template, with plot-dictated companionship and automatized conversations. Enemies are superimposed on backgrounds, and combat is strictly round-based. Overworld and towns are shown from top-down view, but dungeons are navigated in a pseudo-3D first-person fashion (without an automap), similarly to Phantasy Star. Lights can be turned off and on, and traps detected and avoided during dungeon exploration.</plot>

There are no puzzles, but pieces of evidence can be collected, stored, and viewed as inventory items. The interaction with the game world is menu-based.</plot>

		<plot>The psychic detective Katsuya Furuyagi is finally able to enjoy a peaceful life with his sweetheart Rieka. But a strange nightmare begins to haunt him. He sees an unknown young woman locked in a secluded castle, begging for help. One night, the nightmare takes a different shape - the woman turns into a miraculous creature as Furuyagi enters the castle. Knowing that his unique psychic skills allow him to communicate directly with people's minds, Furuyagi begins to wonder if the nightmare has anything to do with reality - which he will find out soon enough.[CR][I]Nightmare[/I] is the fifth entry in the Psychic Detective series. Like its predecessors, it is a Japanese-style adventure game with locations represented as still screens viewed from first-person perspective. Conversations and event-triggering advance the plot; there is no inventory management or puzzles. The player can interact with objects on screen in a point-and-click fashion, with verb commands selected from a menu.</plot>

		<plot>Pu-Li-Ru-La is a psychedelic side-scrolling arcade beat 'em up set in the magical land of Radishland. As the story goes, some evil magical entity has stolen the keys of time for the towns in Radishland, freezing time and turning every animal and creature into evil magical contraptions. Only Zac and Mel, empowered with their "invented magic sticks" are able to escape the curse and must thread through Radishland turning all the monsters back into their original form and recovering the keys of time.[CR]Gameplay-wise the game is a side-scrolling beat 'em up in which you control your character in a 2.5D isometric plane as he clears each stage by beating the many wacky enemies with his stick and a few magic spells that are randomly selected whenever you start the game. At the end of each stage there is a harder "boss" creature you must defeat and upon doing so you proceed to the next stage.[CR]The game is notable for its surreal graphic design, featuring digitized graphics merged with hand-drawn sprites and featuring mostly colorful nonsensical graphics. Features single player or co-op two-player gameplay modes.</plot>

		<rom name="mame-merged/mame-merged/fmtowns.zip" size="3100000"/>
		<plot>A year after the release of the falling block puzzle game Puyo Puyo for MSX and Famicom, an arcade version was released that took the basic concept, but transformed it from a solo into a competitive game, changing the series fundamentally: all ports and later entries in the series are based on this version.[CR]The original arcade version has two modes: a single-player story mode and a two-player competitive mode. In story mode (which is based on characters from Compile's RPG series Madō Monogatari), the player controls Arle Nadja (Silvana in the English translation of the arcade version), a young sorceress, whose goal is to defeat Satan. To do so, she has to win 12 battles against his minions until she can meet him in a final confrontation. The game offers an extra training mode against three lesser opponents, as well as the ability to start from level 4 of the main game.[CR]During a match, pairs of puyos fall down from the top of the screen into each player's field. They can be moved left or right, rotated in either direction and made to drop faster. The goal is to arrange puyos of the same color into patterns of at least four, with horizontal or vertical (but no diagonal) connections. Doing so removes them from the field (with any unconnected puyos falling down) while at the same time sending garbage blocks into the opponent's field. Creating patterns of more than four, several different patterns at the same time, or chain reactions creates more garbage blocks. The garbage blocks can only be removed by creating patterns adjacent to them. The player whose playing field reaches the top first loses. In single-player mode, the falling speed of the puyos increases level by level and each of the enemies plays in a unique style.[CR]The home ports also add an endless single-player mode, in which there is no opponent (and thus no garbage blocks) and one simply plays for a high score, similar to the MSX/Famicom version.</plot>

		<plot>The challenge in each level of Puzznic is to manoeuvre a selection of blocks into place so as to clear them all, by making them make contact with blocks of the same design. You control a cross-hair, which can move a block left or right, which can cause it to fall if there is no block under the space it would occupy.[CR]There are many complications in terms of solving the levels. Moving platforms meaning that you need to move a block at a particular time, or in particular order, to prevent them being blockaded. In some situations there are an odd number of a certain type of block - solving these requires positioning two of the blocks one space apart, such that a move will result in a piece making contact with two others, and immediately removing all three. You will also encounter blocks positioned on platforms suspended in space and gaps in level arrangements meaning that a certain number of blocks must be in place to make a certain move possible (by forming a stack, for example).[CR]The game structure is slightly unusual, as after you complete each batch of four levels you get a choice of two sets of levels - you are progressing through an expanding matrix of levels, which means there are two sets on level 2, three on level 3, four on level 4, and so on. This means that there are a total of 220 screens in the game. Each screen is played against a time limit, and losing a level (either by running out of time, or by making a poor move and leaving an impossible position) loses one of your three lives.</plot>

		<plot>Rayxanber (ライザンバー) is the name of a trilogy of scrolling shooter video games developed by Japanese software company Data West, published from 1990 to 1992.[CR]The series generally resembles R-Type, particularly in art style and gameplay. The plot and setting uses the same trope as games like R-Type and Gradius; it concerns an ongoing war between mankind and a race of invading aliens belonging to the Zoul Empire, and the player's primary enemy consists of bioships and enormous organic fortresses.</plot>

		<plot>[I]Haiiro no Majo[/I] is one of the several different games set in the fictional Lodoss War universe created by Ryo Mizuno. The game's introductory plot loosely follows the events of the first novel, [I]The Grey Witch[/I], centering on the enigmatic character Karla and her influence on the world's politics. Several popular characters from the cycle (such as the dwarf Ghim whom the player can recruit early in the game) make an appearance as well.[CR]Despite its Japanese origins and anime-style visual aesthetics, this incarnation of the series is a Western-style role-playing game in the tradition of Wizardry and Ultima games. Rather than following a linear story focused on a lead character, the player creates a party of characters and takes them on a journey through the world of Lodoss. A few NPCs can join the party as well. Character races include Humans, Elves, Dwarves, and Halflings, while the classes comprise Warriors, Shamans, Priests, Scouts, and Knights. The player can manually distribute five bonus points among the character's six attributes: Strength, Intelligence, Agility, Endurance, Luck, and Personal Beauty.[CR]After the party has been created the heroes find themselves in the starting town. All the towns have identical or similar location visuals (inns, temples, markets, etc.), and can only be navigated by selecting locations from a menu. Overworld navigation and battles are viewed from a top-down perspective; dungeons are done in pseudo-3D first-person view and require illuminated torches for exploration.[CR]Battles occur either randomly or are triggered whenever the party enters a specific location. The player can opt to set combat on auto, the result calculated according to the participants' parameters. Manual fighting involves navigating characters on the battle field in round-based fashion, selecting physical attacks or magical spells when enemies are in their range.</plot>

		<plot>[I]Goshiki no Maryū[/I] is a follow-up to Haiiro no Majo and is set in the Lodoss War universe in the 6th century NRC (New Royal Calendar), about a decade after the War of Heroes ended with a dramatic battle between two former companions, King Fahn of Valis and Emperor Beld of Marmo. An era of relative peace and stability followed, which soon was disrupted by armed conflicts between different countries and internal turmoil on Marmo.[CR]Like its predecessor, the game is a Western-style role-playing game, its Japanese origins and anime aesthetics notwithstanding. Visually and gameplay-wise, it is very similar to the previous game. The player creates a party of heroes (up to six active characters), selecting between four races and seven classes. The party is then free to explore much of the continent in a non-linear fashion, visiting towns and exploring pseudo-3D first-person maze-like dungeons. Combat engine is identical to that of the preceding game. Compared to the first game there is a larger overworld, more dungeons, more guilds and sub-quests, as well as several NPCs for hire in the first town.</plot>

		<plot>Three sisters of the Saijō family - Michie, Saki, and Erika - lived together peacefully in a quiet house. Their parents have died but left them a very large fortune, which evoked jealousy in people surrounding them. On Michie's twentieth birthday their greedy and corrupt uncle, who recently lost a vast amount of money due to failed business transactions, sent his goons to extort from the young women the fortune they rightfully possessed.[CR][I]Reijō Monogatari[/I] has very little interaction, reducing it to occasional scenes where the player has three choices to make. Most of these lead to dead ends, while others open new choices and trigger the next scene. There are no branches in the story, but the player can choose to go through the scenario from the point of view of either of the sisters. The game mainly consists of pornographic scenes, most involving rape and torture. Some of these scenes are animated.</plot>

		<plot>In the year 19XX, a huge meteorite fell upon Tokyo. Within a short time the entire city was destroyed. Due to unforeseen radioactivity and diseases spread by a new virus, the survivors have turned into horrifying mutants, and corpses were reanimated as zombies. The few remaining humans had to live underground, from where they attempt to continue their resistance. Keiko Kirihara, the only female member of their small armed force, is sent to find a route to a safer location, which lies in the city's dangerous areas.[CR][I]Rejection[/I] is a hybrid of a shooter and a role-playing game. The entire game is viewed from first-person perspective, and much of it is spent in maze-like areas. It cannot be considered a first-person shooter in the sense of Wolfenstein 3D, however, since the graphics are pseudo-3D and the movement is step-based and not fluent. Keiko can use a variety of firearms and melee weapons (such as knives). Health kits and ammunition can be found in the stages. Enemies would often respawn to give the player the opportunity to level up Keiko, since experience points are awarded for defeating them.</plot>

		<plot>You are standing behind the white house. There is something in the mailbox. A video message from a wizard informing you that you are the sweepstakes winner to the Valley of the Sparrows... right now, by magic flight. Upon arriving at this mysterious place however, not everything is as it should be. There's nobody to meet you and those who you do come across don't seem to have any knowledge about a sweepstakes. It looks like this is a private vacation and you'll need to find your own way through this land.[CR][I]Return to Zork[/I] is a first-person adventure game using live actors and video sequences. The game is similar to Myst in interface; the player is also able to rotate the viewpoint to discover new areas and uncover items that can be used or picked up. Various characters will be met along the way and spoken to via a system of dialog choices. The game allows the player to experiment with items in various ways, including discharging them; however, this often leads to "dead ends", rendering it impossible to complete the game.</plot>

He agrees to let Tomoki participate in the school's summer camp, under the condition that he wears woman's clothes and passes as a girl.[CR][I]Rinkan Gakkō[/I] plays like a visual novel, having no permanent menu and (with a few exceptions) no other way to interact with the environment but by selecting choices or locations to visit. The choices usually affect the storyline only in a minor way, and there is no possibility to die in the game.</plot>

		<plot>In the 1940s, the Nazis built a base on the moon and plan to use a mysterious substance called Lunarium to reduce people's intelligence. However, in the 21st Century time travel has been mastered, as have jet-propulsion backpacks, plus some cataclysmic weaponry and advanced code-breaking equipment. These items are sent back in time to you in order to change the result of the war by using this technology to find their five rocket factories and destroy the moon base.[CR]The game fits the Cinemaware template closely, with a string of action sequences linked by cinematic animation sequences to set the scene. There's also a strategic element, as you move your spies around to gain information and avoid detection, and decide how much Lunarium to use at each stage of the game. Action sequences include hand-to-hand combat with a Nazi guard, and flying through the air shooting either hordes of enemy planes or the Zeppelin itself.</plot>

		<plot>Kyōhei and Ayano were a happy couple and decided to get married. One month after their wedding Ayano died in a traffic accident. Two years have passed since. Kyōhei is taking care of Ayano's little sister and keeps contact with her other relatives and friends. He tries to move on with his life at home and at work. However, he in unsure as to how his romantic life will progress. At the time of crucial decisions he suddenly seems a woman on the street who looks like Ayano...[CR][I]Sayonara no Mukō-gawa[/I] is a visual novel. Despite its tragic premise, the game keeps a rather light-hearted tone and the story mostly focuses on Kyōhei's sexual encounters with the various female characters. The gameplay is nearly non-existing, with only a few instances of player's input during its course, all confined to selecting a room to visit in the house. Many of these choices make no difference and simply require the player to select the "right" one in order to trigger the next scene.</plot>

		<plot>In the distant future humans have left Earth, carrying its ecosystem with them. However, the journey to the stars lasted longer than they had thought. Computers took control of navigation, and humans had nothing else to do but sleep, dreaming of a new paradise. When the mysterious Scarab-X forces attacked, the Scavenger 4 squadron became humanity's only hope for survival.[CR]Novastorm is a rail shooter in which players blast enemies against a cinematic backdrop, trying to kill the computer-controlled fighters before they take over the world. Unlike first-generation interactive movies with action, the game has hooks into the environment: if the player-controlled fighter moves into the path of a pre-rendered obstacle, there is a collision and the craft takes damage.</plot>

		<plot>By the year 3260, humans have mastered interstellar travel and successfully colonized almost the entire Milky Way. Seven hundred years later, the star cluster Jiro became home to political conflicts and struggles for dominance. The player's task is to turn the weak nation of Sankuri into a powerful force, uniting other stars of the cluster under its leadership.[CR][I]Schwarzschild[/I] is a turn-based strategy game. The game deals mostly with large-scale space battles and preparations for them. There is little focus on political management within a single country, though there are various diplomatic options available. As the player acquires and deploys spaceships, they move and fight according to pre-defined commands. There are no separate battles where the player inputs active orders; instead, the player can opt to change the movement trajectory or tactics of a ship, watching the events unfold when the turn is over. The interface is entirely menu-driven and occupies a large portion of the screen; two other windows are dedicated to the map of the star cluster and visual depictions of ships and their battles.</plot>

		<plot>[I]The Cradle End[/I] is the fourth entry in the Schwarzschild series. The events of the game take place in 3958, two years before those depicted in Schwarzschild II: Teikoku no Haishin. The setting this time is Bardis star system. The omnipresent dominance of empires has been replaced by alliances and struggle between smaller nations. The player takes control of Clair Youngleaf, the leader of one of these nations, who must decide its future fate through diplomacy and wars.[CR]The game's concept is identical to that of the previous installments of the series. Like before, grand strategy is the core of the game, while the actual battles proceed automatically, their outcome depending on the player's preparation rather than on tactical decisions. The interface has been changed once again, featuring windows that can be stretched and moved around. There are more diplomatic options and stronger emphasis on pacts and cooperation between nations. It is also possible to research and build fighter craft, as well as place satellites in space and cannons on planet surfaces. Like the previous game, [I]The Cradle End[/I] has anime-style visuals and assigns individual characteristics to nation leaders.</plot>

		<plot>Deep in the Caribbean lies Melee Island, ruled by the governor Elaine Marley. The cruel pirate LeChuck is deeply in love with her - so deeply that he refuses to accept his own death. As a ghost, he dwells with his undead crew somewhere near the mysterious Monkey Island. Meanwhile, a young fellow named Guybrush Threepwood is determined to become a real pirate. At the Scumm Bar he meets three pirates who tell him he has to complete three difficult tasks in order to be worthy of this title. But as Guybrush is trying to complete these tasks, he encounters the lovely governor, and this meeting changes his life forever. Risking to incur the wrath of LeChuck, Guybrush has to prove his wit is as sharp as his sword, and figure out a way to foil the ghost pirate's plans.[CR]The Secret of Monkey Island is an adventure game that utilizes the command verb-based SCUMM interface first introduced in Maniac Mansion: the player constructs commands for Guybrush by selecting an appropriate verb and then combining it with an object or an inventory item. Objects that can be interacted with are highlighted when the player places a cursor over them. The game is the first LucasArts adventure in which it is impossible to get irrevocably stuck; like in Loom, the player character also cannot die. The branching dialogue system, where the player chooses between several available responses during conversations, allows the player to talk to characters in different ways without fearing a wrong choice, and is often used as a humorous device.[CR]The puzzles are predominantly inventory-based; most of the problems in the game are solved by picking up items and combining them with each other or with objects (or people) in the game world. Several tasks are dialogue-based; among those is the humorous "insult swordfighting", which involves Guybrush learning and choosing witty insults while dueling pirates.[CR]The CD DOS and FM Towns versions of the game have slightly updated interface (with graphically represented inventory items instead of the text-only labels in the original version), as well as CD audio music tracks.</plot>

		<plot>For a while peace was reigning in the magical Kingdom of Hyunckel. However, dark forces have emerged again. Commanding hellish creatures, they managed to capture the top female generals of the Hyunckel army, sealing them in special devices resembling eggs. Only three generals remained free, and they must liberate their companions and re-capture the land.[CR][I]Shangrlia 2[/I] is a turn-based tactical game and a sequel to Shangrlia. The goal of the game is to capture castles occupied by the enemy, freeing commanders on the way. Unlike in the first game, the player is no longer allowed to choose any battle right from the beginning and is at first restricted to only three battles. Same applies to characters and unit types: in the beginning the player can only control three types of fighters, and other characters are unlocked gradually.[CR]There are fifteen unit types altogether (as opposed to ten in the previous game). New units include different types of horsemen, chariots, winged horses, golem commanders, etc. In addition, each unit comes in three variations, e.g. catapults and cannons are considered the same type, variants of which can be unlocked by completing battles and freeing them. Each unit gradually advances in strength, and must reach a "master" level to be actively selected by the player and positioned on the battle. This time, enemy units are mostly completely different and mainly consist of various monster types such as skeletons, minotaurs, dragons, undead mages, assorted hell creatures etc.[CR]Winning battles gradually unlocks erotic pictures of the female generals. The sexual content is noticeably heavier than in the first game and includes non-traditional types of sex as well.</plot>

		<plot>In this game, the player is cast into the roles of Sherlock Holmes, the greatest fictional detective of all times, and his friend and partner Dr. Watson, as they have to investigate and successfully solve three criminal cases:[CR] * [I]The Mummy's Curse[/I] deals with the horrifying death of three men, which were apparently murdered by an ancient mummy;[CR] * [I]The Mystified Murderess[/I] involves a woman who has been convicted for murdering her beloved one, but cannot seem to recall anything of what had happened to her;[CR] * [I]The Tin Soldier[/I] concerns the murder of an old general, whose past must be investigated in order to find the killer.[CR][I]Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective[/I] can be described as a hybrid of adventure game and simulation. Gameplay process involves traveling to various locations in London, interrogating suspects, gathering clues, checking out the newspapers, and eventually presenting all the evidence to the judge; if the latter finds the circumstances incriminating, he will accept the results of the investigation, and the case will be considered solved. Though the basic gameplay is rather typical for adventure games, the amount of real detective work and the focus of the game on purely case-related actions rather than exploration and manipulation of items makes it comparable to a simulation of a criminal investigation.[CR]The game is notable for being one of the earliest "multimedia" titles, having been released on a CD ROM and featuring rather long (though windowed) video sequences with live actors as introductions and cutscenes, which frequently occur when the heroes investigate suspects.</plot>

		<plot>In this game, the player is cast into the roles of Sherlock Holmes, the greatest fictional detective of all times, and his friend and partner Dr. Watson, as they have to investigate and successfully solve three criminal cases:[CR] * [I]The Mummy's Curse[/I] deals with the horrifying death of three men, which were apparently murdered by an ancient mummy;[CR] * [I]The Mystified Murderess[/I] involves a woman who has been convicted for murdering her beloved one, but cannot seem to recall anything of what had happened to her;[CR] * [I]The Tin Soldier[/I] concerns the murder of an old general, whose past must be investigated in order to find the killer.[CR][I]Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective[/I] can be described as a hybrid of adventure game and simulation. Gameplay process involves traveling to various locations in London, interrogating suspects, gathering clues, checking out the newspapers, and eventually presenting all the evidence to the judge; if the latter finds the circumstances incriminating, he will accept the results of the investigation, and the case will be considered solved. Though the basic gameplay is rather typical for adventure games, the amount of real detective work and the focus of the game on purely case-related actions rather than exploration and manipulation of items makes it comparable to a simulation of a criminal investigation.[CR]The game is notable for being one of the earliest "multimedia" titles, having been released on a CD ROM and featuring rather long (though windowed) video sequences with live actors as introductions and cutscenes, which frequently occur when the heroes investigate suspects.</plot>

		<plot>The plot of [I]Shinc[/I] is as simple as its title: the hero - aptly named Hero Narcissus - is a lone adventurer in search of a job. He arrives at a town which is populated mostly by young sexy women. The hero hasn't even enough money to visit the local brothel. Since the king hasn't asked him to rescue a princess (yet), his first quest, given to him by the pretty weapon shop owner, is to venture into a nearby cave, "Realm of Anguish", to defeat the monsters lurking there and retrieve valuable items. Naturally, this is just the beginning of a long career, which involves saving the kingdom and becoming a true hero.[CR]The gameplay of [I]Shinc[/I] is also very unpretentious: it's a first-person dungeon crawler with a basic combat system. Enemies pop up randomly, and the player inputs general commands ("Auto", "Offense", etc.) to deal with them in turn-based fashion. As per RPG rule, player characters gain experience points and money from fallen enemies, advancing in levels. In towns there is no physical movement, and interaction is done through command menu.[CR]There are scenes with nudity and sexual situations in the game.</plot>

		<plot>In the middle of the continent of Lorelei lies the Karma mountain range, separating two cultures. To the East is the peaceful, rural Canaan federation. To the West is Dardila, the land of monks. The peaceful days of these nations were over when a meteor fell on Dardila, gradually turning the monks evil. A war erupted, and Dardilan forces overrun Canaan. Marion, the crown prince of Canaan, has just turned fourteen, and has to deal with the tremendous responsibility of commanding his army and winning the war.[CR][I]Dead Force[/I] is a tactical role-playing game. The entire game consists of large-scale battles between armies. Each unit is represented by a single character icon. The soldiers share hit points, equipment, and levels, and are generally treated like separate characters which can be navigated on the overhead battle screen in turn-based fashion. When a player-controlled unit is adjacent to an enemy one, a battle ensues, which proceeds automatically and is displayed on a separate screen.</plot>

		<plot>With $100000 in the bank after taking out loans and selling stocks, it's time to start a railroad! Choose from 4 scenarios across two continents with randomly generated resources, and design your own railroad that moves people and goods across the country. Use the revenue to continue expanding, while keeping control of your company and appeasing your stock holders with growth and revenues. Play the stock market with company assets. Drive your competitors out of business with buyouts and rate wars. Multiple types of resources to carry (roughly grouped as slow freight, fast freight, passengers, mail) and convert, own facilities to maximize profit (buy a steel mill and the conversion from iron ore to steel makes money for YOU). Use the latest available technology to your advantage (new locomotives). Your objective is to retire with a huge bonus (based on your company's assets) and become the President or the Prime Minister (depending on which continent).[CR]The game is essentially a bird's-eye-view real-time strategy game with aspects of building and stock market manipulation. Each fiscal period is 2-years, which corresponds to 1-day of track time. Build different sizes of stations to take care of different local needs, create trains that switch consists at different stations and maximize throughput. Upgrade/retire/modify trains as times change. The faster the trains arrive, the more money they earn. Multiple options will keep you busy as each game is different.</plot>

		<plot>In the year 1999, the Guild of Magicians was about to open a portal to the mysterious dimension of Nemesis, intending to rejuvenate Earth's polluted atmosphere. However, one of the magicians betrayed the Guild and used the portal for his own gain, releasing hostile creatures known as Lucifer Hawk onto Earth. Twenty-four years later, a special all-female unit known as Attacked Mystification Police was formed to combat the enemy.[CR][I]Case: Titanic[/I] is based on the manga and anime [I]Silent Möbius[/I]. It presents an original episode that involves the sighting of a strange ship in the clouds above Tokyo. Closer inspection reveals that the ship appears to be identical to the famous RMS Titanic that sank in the Atlantic Ocean in 1912. The game's nameless male protagonist boards the ship along with Rally, Kiddy, Nami and other heroines from the manga in order to investigate this seemingly inexplicable phenomenon.[CR]The gameplay is done in Japanese-style, puzzle-less adventure format. The entire game is set on the Titanic. The player is generally free to visit various areas of the ship in any order, though access to certain locations is restricted and necessary events must be triggered in order to gain it. The commands Look, Talk and Move are used on most screens, and there is no inventory management.</plot>

The first task is to place essentials such as housing, transport links, schools, factories and shops. There are 50 types of these, allowing for homes of all standards and different types of businesses. Make sure to consider which sites are effective for which tasks. Some power sources pollute, others don't but are more expensive. Taxes must be raised to ensure an income, and then portions allocated to public services such as policing and roads. Earthquakes, floods and fires are all emergency situations that must be dealt to contain any damage.[CR]Successful mayoring will cause the small village to grow into a town, then a city and finally a metropolis. As the city's size grows so do it's needs. Commercial buildings may suddenly find that they need an airport to expand trade, or housing may find itself changing rapidly as vast amounts of people come and leave.[CR]The game also includes 8 pre-defined time-limited scenarios, with specific challenges and targets. The environment varies in each game (especially if you have the Terrain Editor add on), and this should affect your choices.</plot>

		<plot>[I]Soft de Hard na Monogatari[/I] is the third entry in System Sacom's [I]Novel Ware[/I] series. The story has humorous overtones and deals with production of computer games. The protagonist is the son of a software company manager and has to fill in as a temporary leader when his father falls sick and is hospitalized. Himself an avid gamer, the young boss has to use his employee's strengths and his own imagination to produce a successful game such as the "Nobara Series" [I]DAME[/I] (an obvious parody of DOME).[CR]Gameplay-wise, the game abandons the adventure format with its set verb-object commands and interaction with the environment, and plays more like a visual novel with light simulation elements. The player has to make choices for the protagonist, which will advance in-game time and ultimately influence the outcome of the story. It is possible to talk to the employees, check out planned software releases, and make other decisions crucial for the company and the hero's success.</plot>

		<plot>[I]Sotsugyō[/I] is the first game in the series, released only in Japan. It puts the player into a position of a high school teacher, whose goal is to successfully lead five female students to graduation within the same semester. In order to do that, the player has to study the individual characteristics of the girls. Each girl has different parameters, different strengths and weaknesses. The teacher should be careful not to overload the students with work, but letting them do what they want is not the right way either. The teacher has also control on other aspects of the students' life: it is possible to have personal conversations with the girls to motivate them, and choose leisure activities for them (such as going to the cinema). The girls can become displeased with the teacher or sick, so it's important to keep the morale high in order to achieve successful graduation.</plot>

		<plot>The Princess Blue was a trading vessel. While cruising through space, it happened upon a derelict ship floating in space. Only one crew member was allowed to investigate the abandoned ship. Suddenly, Manchi raiders appeared on the viewscreen. The Manchi managed to ambush and destroy the Princess Blue. The only surviving crew member from the Princess Blue swears revenge and is determined to do everything in his power to defeat the Manchi.[CR]Space Rogue is a hybrid game that combines space flight and combat simulation with trading and RPG elements such as interaction with characters and a quest-based structure with a main plot line. Space flight takes place in two different modes: Cruise Flight, which is ideal for travelling quickly, and Newtonian Flight, which works best for combat and precision flying. There are also three different camera views for the 3D exploration and combat. Each planetary system has a variety of destinations and obstacles to travel through via a top-down navigational map. Traveling to an outpost, a space station, or any other location with the star system can be done simply by selecting it and charting a course, or in real-time 3D flight mode.[CR]Interstellar travel between systems, is done by finding a Malir Gate and using it to reach hyperspace. While in hyperspace, the game becomes a simple 'tunnel' game where the player must manually control the ship not to hit any of the walls. Also hyperspace travel eats away at the ship, so the faster the player can get through them, the more armor the ship retains. While traveling in space the ship may get attacked, or the player may opt to assault any other ships first.[CR]It is also possible to buy and sell various goods, earning money and spending it on outfitting the ship with weapons and various upgrades, such as for example a device that allows it to move more stealthily through space and avoid detection by hostiles. The player character has a reputation rating with various factions such as the Imperium, the pirates, and others. This rating is affected by the player's actions towards them and can be raised or lowered by helping specific factions fight others.[CR]When docked at outposts or stations, the view shifts to top-down, and the player navigates the protagonist through the location in an adventure or RPG-like fashion, examining objects and talking to characters. Conversations may have multiple choices, and a few instances require the player to type in keywords, though for the most parts responses are selected from a menu. The game has a main plot line that requires finding, talking, and performing tasks for characters, as well as sub-quests that may result in various rewards such as money or ship upgrades.</plot>

		<plot>As humans evolved and began to colonize space, they encountered a large alien organization known as the Galaxy Alliance. Hostilities between various human factions and aliens were inevitable. In addition to that, a mysterious group known as the VOID started to carry out attacks on civilians. Mercenaries and space explorers, called "hunters", formed a treaty of their own, and one of them must face the VOID and bring peace to the galaxy.[CR]The Odysseus Project is a follow-up to Star Cruiser. Gameplay concept and visual style are very similar to that of the predecessor: it is a first-person 3D shooter with extensive exploration and customization elements, which grants it a light role-playing angle. Much of the game is spent on planet surfaces, in populated or hostile areas. Combat is action-based by default, but there is an option for a menu-based combat as well. There is a variety of weapons, armor, gadgets, and items to find or purchase. It is also possible to physically navigate a spaceship. Combat in space plays similarly to on-foot battles, with the additional of a freely rotatable camera.</plot>

		<plot>Following the collapse of Soviet Union, USA began to dominate the politics of the Commonwealth of Independent Nations. Islamic countries started a global jihad against the Western world, and as a result, petroleum has become an even more rare and valuable resource. In a chain of events, Alaska declared independence, and major powers of the world began fighting over its oil-rich territory. Japan turned into the world's most powerful nation, while United States and the Catholic Church were weakened; by the year 2011, humanity's dreams of unification have become completely shattered, and the fate of the world was decided by mercenary organizations.[CR]Similar to Wing Commander in gameplay style and visual presentation, Strike Commander is a flight simulator with action-oriented combat. You lead a rag-tag mercenary fighter squadron known as the Wildcats, trying to make a living in a dangerous, chaotic world. Somewhat simplified dogfights in your blackmarket-purchased F-16s are supplemented by interactive cutscenes where you converse with your teammates, or go into town to buy new contracts.</plot>

All the versions have the same opponents, cutscenes, and gameplay rules. The computer version adds a versus mode in which girls can compete against each other, while the Super Famicom (SNES) version has a so-called "puzzle mode", which reveals parts of a puzzle as the player wins mahjong rounds.</plot>

		<plot>Super Shooting Towns is a fairly simple horizontally-scrolling shooter. The player controls a flying mechanical bug-like device that has to fight its way through levels populated by various organic (predominantly insect-like) creatures. There is no permanent secondary weapon, and the relatively infrequent power-ups may either switch the properties of the main weapon temporarily or enhance it (e.g. enable backwards shooting).[CR]The game's stand-out feature is the included editor. This utility allows players to design and customize their own side-scrolling shooter levels. It is possible to draw maps as well as change the parameters of the enemies, affecting the difficulty of the stage.</plot>

		<plot>Suzaku is the youngest in the tribe of warriors of the country of Oomi, which has a long tradition of martial arts and magical powers. The old teacher sees to that Suzaku is training with the best warriors of the country, and the young hero's first true assignment consists of retrieving a magical mirror from a nearby mountain cave. Little does Suzaku know that a series of events will occur that will require the warriors to seek help from other countries, and together defeat the evil that is threatening the land...[CR][I]Suzaku[/I] is an RPG with predominantly Japanese-style elements (linear gameplay, party of characters that are essential to the story, simple leveling system, etc.). There are towns in which player-controlled party can rest and shop; however, most of the gameplay takes place in pseudo-3D, first-person maze-like dungeons (with an auto-map feature). There is no "world map" to navigate. Enemies appear randomly and have to be dispatched in simple turn-based combat, by using physical attacks or magic.</plot>

		<plot>In the future, the world is controlled by a handful of global corporations (syndicates). You are the Marketing director (hit man) for one of these companies. It is your job to take control away from the competitors. The job is not one of diplomacy, but one of brute force and physical control. Advance your way to the top of the corporation by successfully completing your missions and managing the money you make from your territories.[CR]The gameplay is visually reminiscent of X-Com, with an angled top-down perspective, but it is real time rather than turn based. You have missions ranging from infiltrate and capture, to seek and destroy. In each of these you direct a team of four agents as they move through the world shooting at anything that gets in their way.[CR]You can upgrade and modify your agents, as well as equip them with tools you have researched or liberated from opposing syndicates. As you complete missions, you gain more funds to use for purchasing agents or researching upgrades and equipment.</plot>

Success will allow the player to rise in rank and status, while failure will see the player's influence diminish, and possibly even result in execution. Depending on the player's actions, the scenario may stick closely to historical fact, or diverge wildly.[CR]The player can travel to various locations via the overworld map, and depending upon their play style, several different modes of play may open up. The player can choose to engage their enemies in turn-based tactical battles, or foster peace through diplomacy. It is also possible to go gambling, date women, and even assassinate enemy (or friendly) characters. However, all actions will have an impact on the player's reputation.</plot>

Most of the game is spent planning schedules for the girls. Practicing music skills, working, having a vacation - everything has an influence on the girls' statistics. It is important to keep the girls happy and reduce their stress; at the same time, having vacations without practicing will diminish their professional skill. Keeping the right balance is the key here.[CR]After a period of training, the player chooses which specific branch he/she wants the girls to compete in: commercial photos (model), staging a musical, performing a pop concert, making a movie, etc. Depending on the player's preparations and previous training, the girls will get higher or lower ratings. The player-controlled group competes against other agencies in a league, and results are shown after each major event.</plot>

		<plot>Volcanic eruptions have been occurring on a deserted planet somewhere in deep space for quite some time. Then, on a fateful day, they culminated in a gigantic explosion, and a terrifying creature appeared. It is the emperor of the Gidans, thought to be defeated in the last galactic war. Now, the threat is back: the Gidans army is quickly assembled, and in a short time they dominate the galaxy again. Only a handful of refugees escape to deliver the news to the astroport. A pilot navigating the HyperFighter One aircraft is sent to stop the Gidans once and for all.[CR]Like its predecessor, Tatsujin Ou (also known as Truxton II) is a vertically scrolling shooter. The gameplay is very similar to that of the first game: the player-controlled aircraft has three basic weapons (distinguished by the colors of corresponding power-ups) and bombs at his disposal. The rest of the power-ups are also the same as in the first game: increasing the ship's speed, the amount of bombs, and the lives of the player characters. A special power-up can also summon two wingmen to fight alongside the hero. Beside the single-player mode, the game also includes co-op multiplayer.</plot>

		<plot>Angels and demons have a disagreement concerning the human race. Some vote for its extermination; other suggest milder solutions. In the end, it is decided to test the humans' abilities. The Earth is invaded by hostile angels and demons of different kind. A boy named Takami is chosen to be the subject of the "examination". At the same time, a young woman named Yuima, discovering her celestial heritage and magical powers, decides to put an end to the invasion...[CR]The player can choose to begin the game as either Takami or Yuima. Takami is a fighter type with strong physical attacks; Yuima is a magic user. Their stories, however, converge early in the game, after which they fight together in a party.[CR][I]Tenshin Ranma[/I] is a traditional first-person 3D dungeon crawler. Enemies appear randomly and must be dealt with in turn-based fashion. Auto-map appears near the main exploration screen, highlighting already explored areas. Leveling up is automatic, like in most Japanese RPGs. Some dungeons have shops, where the heroes can buy weapons and items.[CR]There are scenes with nudity and eroticism, but no "hardcore" pornographic sex scenes.</plot>

		<plot>Dominating the exciting world of Theme Park ownership is your goal in this strategy game from Bullfrog. The first task is to set up your rides within the available land, structuring convenient paths and queues and ideally leaving some space for bigger rides once they become available, and include some lakes and trees to increase the park's allure. Rides range from Teacups and Haunted Houses to the biggest most elaborate roller-coaster you can design, and water rides that loop around other rides.[CR]Shops must also be included, so that the visitors can buy food, drinks and souvenirs - the cunning player will combine salt, sugar and caffeine settings to maximize consumer interest. Staff must be hired to keep everything running smoothly, and they will only work for what they consider a fair rate of pay.[CR]You are competing against other Theme Parks, so don't let them get an advantage over you - monitor your success in attracting customers and financial viability closely using the supplied statistics pages. More important, ensure that research is adequately funded to produce new rides.[CR]It can be played in three modes - Sandbox level lets you concentrate on the park design elements, while Sim and Full add more strategic features.</plot>

In the middle of the hero's sobbing, a girl pops up out of nowhere in the room. It appears she's from the future, with personal reasons that have something to do with Shinji's present love-life situation. After that, the story is in his hands...[CR]Like in most visual novels, the gameplay is automatic for the most part; at certain points, the player gets to choose the process on how the story goes. Although most of the time, either choice really makes no difference in the end. The only difference in this game is that if the player makes the wrong choice, some of the more 'interesting' graphical scenes will not be triggered.</plot>

		<plot>Titan is a 2D arcade game / puzzle game hybrid.[CR]For some reason, mad professors of the future tend to invent strange entertainment games in which every participant dies. Professor Hybrys’ variant is called Titan and involves a ball, a control unit and 80 labyrinths. Your objective is either to destroy all destructible blocks in each level by hitting them with the sphere, or to pilot it to the exit. The black ball is beyond your control; it will bounce straight or diagonally through the labyrinth with constant speed. You move the control unit, a small box, with you are to position in a way that the ball bounces off it in the desired direction. You can also catch the sphere by quickly moving over it, and then release it in a direction of your choice.[CR]The labyrinths not only contain harmless, destructible blocks, but also increasingly difficult hazards. If the sphere or your control unit hit a skull symbol, one of your nine lives is lost. Teleporters exchange the position of you and the ball, wall pieces can be pushed around or destroyed by your unit, floor tiles will grow into walls when you pass over them too often. The high game speed can be slowed down by holding the space key – a very useful option in tricky situations.[CR]Titan mixes an arcade game foundation (requiring quick reflexes and good nerves) with puzzle game elements (requiring logical thinking to beat the complex levels). The challenge is to control the sphere accurately, yet indirectly.</plot>

Spirit Points (SP) are required to execute any attack; they can be replenished by "resting" (during battle), using special items, or walking (outside of battle).[CR]The game features explicit sex scenes.</plot>

		<plot>[I]Ōgon no Rashinban[/I] ("Golden Compass") is the second case starring the private detective Ryūnosuke Tōdō, following Kohakuiro no Yuigon. Like the first case, the adventure takes place in the 1920's. This time the investigator finds himself on a ship sailing from San Francisco to Yokohama. A mysterious murder occurs, and it is up to Tōdō to gather evidence and find the culprit.[CR]Like its predecessor, the game mainly follows an adventure format with some simulation elements. The game is heavy on realistic investigation routine, and mostly consists of questioning characters and finding clues that would help to solve the case. Unlike the previous entry, the game has isometric graphics with superimposed character portraits, and elements of point-and-click interface (e.g. when navigating the ship map and accessing various locations).</plot>

		<plot>A young boy named Seed Kasim was dreaming of a peaceful life in his home village with the girl of his dreams. However, the girl's father made it clear that he'll only accept a strong warrior as his son-in-law. Accompanied by his childhood friend, the gorgeous Selena, Seed heads to the city, where the Battle God Tournament takes place. The young man must venture to the nearby dungeon, defeating the monsters lurking there, while being careful of other tournament participants...[CR][I]Tōshin Toshi 2[/I] plays similarly to its predecessor and to most other Alice Soft RPGs: most of the game is dedicated to exploring maze-like top-down dungeons (with auto-map feature), fighting random and event-related enemies in turn-based combat. Battles and town locations are viewed from first person perspective. Spirit Points (SP) are required to execute any attack; they can be replenished by "resting" (during battle), using special items, or walking (outside of battle).[CR]The game features explicit sex scenes.</plot>

		<plot>[I]Trigger 2[/I] consists of three unrelated stories. The protagonist of the first one is Kerberos, the mythical guardian hellhound. Following a dispute with Lucifer, Kerberos was banned to Earth, where he assumed human form and eventually decided to battle monsters who had been sexually assaulting young women.[CR]In the second story, a seventeen-year-old modern-day girl named Ryoko is magically transferred to a parallel world known as Ryudo. There, she receives painful sexual "training" ans is send to battle machine enemies.[CR]The third story is set in American Old West and focuses on Marie, a female rogue who wants to pass for a young man. The rest of the plot depicts various sexual encounters of hers with men and women, consensual and non-consensual alike.[CR]The gameplay is nearly identical to that of the previous game, with rudimentary interaction consisting of three choices that often have to be repeated in order to trigger the next event. A few choices may lead to different endings. Like its predecessor, the game is heavy on explicit sexual scenes, many of which are animated.</plot>

		<plot>[I]True Heart[/I] is set in a medieval fantasy country Riku, and the player controls the young prince Gerard, the only heir to the throne. According to the country's tradition, every prince has to undergo a series of trials when he turns seventeen, to make sure that he would be a responsible ruler. However, our young hero is much more interested in other kind of "trials", those involving himself and members of the opposite sex. Surrounded by young and pretty girls of different social backgrounds and personality types, the prince has to find out which one holds the key to his heart... and not just his other body parts.[CR][I]True Heart[/I] is a typical Japanese-style adventure, with a command menu including standard commands such as "Look", "Talk", "Think", etc. As in most Japanese adventures, there are no puzzles or other challenges of any kind; however, it is possible to unlock (or skip) certain scenes (mostly of sexual nature) by choosing to go to certain places at specific moments.</plot>

		<plot>This game is based on the pen and paper RPG Tunnels and Trolls.[CR]After a four hundred year long war, humans and monsters finally signed a peace treaty, and harmony returned to the Dragon Land - but not for long. The leader of the monsters, the mysterious Lerotra'hh, declared the peace contract was invalid. Monsters began to attack human settlements once again. The only one who can save the humans is the mighty wizard Khazan. Unfortunately, Khazan was imprisoned in his exile. This is where a group of brave adventurers enters the picture, determined to rescue Khazan and defeat the evil.[CR]The party explores the world of Crusaders of Khazan from a top-down perspective, roaming wilderness areas, visiting towns, talking to people, receiving quests, and descending into dungeons. Battles take place on a top-down battle screen, on which characters can move freely and attack enemies in turn-based style. The game features point-and-click interface with multiple windows.</plot>

		<plot>The sequel to OutRun features similar basic gameplay to the original, with the action viewed from behind the car, and the challenge being to complete each stage within the time limit. Contact can cause the car to spin, slow down or even flip; in each case you will lose time.[CR]There are 16 stages set across the US, gradually moving from east to west, all depicted differently visually. After every 4 levels, you go into a shop screen, with a choice of upgrades. As the title implies, you now have a turbo booster installed, which speeds up the car, although over-use can cause the engine to overheat, and it is not recharged until each shop section. You have 5 continues, and failure to complete the course within the time limit costs you one.</plot>

		<plot>[I]2 Shot Diary[/I] is a collection of twelve short episodes of sexual nature, each told by a different young woman, presented as entries in their diaries. There is no connection between the stories. Each heroine has a different profession and social status (high school student, nurse, model, etc.), where each episode usually centers around a particular sexual theme (voyeurism, lesbian sex, rape, etc.). The game is almost entirely pornographic, with nearly each screen being a depiction of a sexual activity.[CR]The game may be considered a visual novel, because no skill whatsoever is required to play the game and most of it is composed of text accompanied by pictures rather than interaction. Instead of making decisions, characteristically for most visual novels, the player chooses words from a menu to insert into the text. If the choice makes no sense, it simply disappears and the player chooses another one.</plot>

		<plot>In the future, space travel has become an inseparable part of human civilization. Humanity spread all over the Milky Way. Most of the problems concerning war, ecological disasters, and others were successfully solved. Human beings have entered an era of peace. But human nature never changes, and most other aspects of human culture haven't either. Since the galaxy became a huge urban playground, a new type of criminals have emerged - interstellar thieves. Piloting their own space ship, they terrorize the galaxy with their cleverly planned tricks. Particularly notorious is a duo of two young and pretty girls, Sati and Shiori... which are the two protagonists of the game.[CR][I]Funny Bee[/I] has a few turn-based battle at pre-set points, during which the playable character executes various attack techniques; however, the system is too rudimentary to be considered a major part of gameplay. The rest of the game plays rather like an adventure in Japanese style. The player chooses menu commands, triggering events and advancing the story. There are also locations with an auto-map, for more convenient navigation (also menu-based). The game contains scenes with nudity.</plot>

		<rom name="mame-merged/mame-merged/fmtowns.zip" size="3100000"/>
		<plot>Following the defeat of the evil triad in the previous three Ultima games, the world of Sosaria changed beyond recognition: continents rose and sank, and new cities were built, heralding the advent of a different civilization. Unified by the reign of the benevolent monarch Lord British, the new world was renamed Britannia. Lord British wished to base people's well-being on the ethical principles of Truth, Love, and Courage, proclaiming the Eight Virtues (Honesty, Compassion, Valor, Justice, Sacrifice, Honor, Spirituality, and Humility) as the ideal everyone should strive for. The person who could accomplish full understanding and realization of these virtues would serve as a spiritual leader and a moral example for the inhabitants of Britannia; he alone would be able to obtain holy artifacts, descend into the Stygian Abyss, and access the Codex of Ultimate Wisdom. This person is the Avatar.[CR]The fourth game in the Ultima series features an improved game engine, with color graphics and enhanced character interaction: the player can have conversations with non-playable characters by typing names of various topics. However, the main difference between Ultima IV and its predecessors in the series (as well as other role-playing games) lies in the game's objectives and the ways to fulfill them.[CR]Instead of building up a character by any means possible in order to face a villain in the end of the game, in Ultima IV the player is trying to become the Avatar, a role model for people. This means upholding the Eight Virtues, basically trying to become a better person. Making morally conscious decisions and helping other people is not done expecting a material reward, but because it is the actual goal of the game and the main focus of its gameplay. The game frowns on behavior typical of most other RPGs, such as backstabbing fleeing enemies or picking up everything that isn't nailed down even if it does not belong to the protagonist. This different approach established the game's reputation as the first "true" Ultima, influencing the design philosophy of later installments and the overall spirit of the series.[CR]Character creation is done by choosing responses to morally ambiguous questions. Each of the Eight Virtues corresponds to a character class; by determining the player's personal priorities in the virtues, the game assigns a class and a starting location for the Avatar. After emerging in Britannia, the player is free to explore it in various ways (on foot, moongate teleportation, on horseback, by ship, etc.). Certain items must be collected in any order to enter the Stygian Abyss and complete the game. The Avatar also has to reach the highest level in all virtues. This is achieved by various means: donating blood increases Sacrifice, not fleeing from combat increases Valor, etc. The process, however, is not irreversible: should the Avatar overpay a blind seller, he gains Compassion points; should he, on the other hand, cheat the seller by underpaying, his level in several virtues would decrease.[CR]These unorthodox features of the game co-exist with plenty of traditional RPG elements, such as dungeons to explore and hostile monsters to kill. Enemies are encountered on the world map as well as in dungeons; combat takes place on separate top-down screens, allowing player-controlled and enemy parties freely move on them. Characters accumulate experience points and level up, gaining higher amount of hit points and access to stronger magic spells. Like in the previous installments of the series, world map, town exploration and combat are presented from a top-down view, while the dungeons are pseudo-3D and are explored from first-person perspective.[CR]Ultima IV also introduces several new gameplay features to the series and role-playing games in general. A number of initially non-playable characters living in various areas of the game world are able to to join the party and fight alongside the hero, replacing traditional player-generated characters or mercenaries and adventurers available only in special locations. Additional new elements include buying and combining reagents in order to cast spells, puzzle rooms in dungeons, and others.</plot>

		<plot>After having brought peace to Britannia during his previous journey there, the Avatar returns to our world. However, he is haunted by ghostly dreams that warn him of a great danger in Britannia. The Avatar decides to travel there once again. Upon his arrival, he witnesses the kidnapping of Baron Almric's daughter. Found guilty of the crime, the Avatar is thrown into the Great Stygian Abyss with the choice of either finding the girl or rotting in the dungeon. On his journey he will have to get along with the many inhabitants of the dungeon, who are survivors of a failed colony, and eventually find out that there's much more to this kidnapping than meets the eye.[CR]Ultima Underworld: The Stygian Abyss is commonly considered the first role-playing game with fluid first-person movement in a real 3D environment. Unlike earlier first-person RPGs such as Dungeon Master or Eye of the Beholder, the player can move in every direction and the graphics are updated continually. The player is also able to look up and down with the press of a key, jump, and swim. The dungeon is not made entirely of corridors and rooms arranged in a rectangular fashion, but has a lot of variety: slopes, stairs, bridges, underground rivers, and more.[CR]The game's combat system is action-oriented. The player has to draw his weapon, aim at his opponent, and hold the cursor over the game screen to inflict damage; the longer the player holds it, the stronger is the attack. Some weapons have different types of attacks, depending on where the cursor is held: for example, jabs are executed when the cursor is near the bottom of the screen, while slashes are performed with the cursor in the middle.[CR]In the beginning of the game, the player chooses the gender, the class, and the initial skills for the Avatar. Skills include various weapon proficiencies, lockpicking, bartering, and others. They can be increased by reciting mantras at special shrines after having accumulated a sufficient amount of experience points. Leveling up also increases the Avatar's hit points and mana. The magic system is based on runes that can be found in the Abyss. If combined in the right order, they produce a magical effect.[CR]As the Abyss is populated by more than just monsters, there are various conversations the Avatar can conduct with non-playable characters. The player can also make choices regarding the Avatar's behavior towards these characters. Game progression is largely non-linear: the player is able to explore most of the Abyss in any order, though several specific tasks must be accomplished in order to complete the story. An auto-map displays all the locations the player has explored previously, and also allows the player to make notes on it.</plot>

		<plot>Ultima Underworld II: Labyrinth of Worlds takes place one year after the events of Ultima VII: The Black Gate. To celebrate the defeat of the Guardian, Lord British invites the Avatar and his companions to his castle. However, in the night of the feast the Guardian attacks again, encasing the castle in a giant gem of blackrock. Deep in the sewers of the castle, another blackrock gem is found, created as an aftereffect of the attack. This gem is a teleporter to other worlds controlled by the Guardian. Now the Avatar must travel to these worlds in order to free the castle from the Guardian's spell.[CR]This sequel to Ultima Underworld plays almost exactly as the original, with its 3D world, action-oriented combat, magic system and multiple-choice conversations. The player creates the character of Avatar, choosing gender, class, and initial skills. These range from weapon proficiencies to social abilities such as diplomacy and bartering. Some of the skills can be increased during the course of the game by visiting trainers. After having accumulated a sufficient amount of experience points, the Avatar levels up, and his hit points and mana are increased. Like its predecessor, the game features an interactive world: many objects can be manipulated and physically moved.[CR]The game's storyline is more connected to the main Ultima series than that of its predecessor, and the game world is larger and has more variety: besides the usual castles and dungeons there are such diverse locations as an ice world, an alien place called Talorus and the enigmatic Ethereal Void. Graphics and sound have also been improved: the size of the viewing window has been increased, there are new monster graphics and the game now features digitized sound effects.</plot>

		<plot>The Avatar, the embodiment of the Eight Virtues and the hero of Britannia, is called back to deal with a grave threat. Lord British, the country's benevolent monarch, has disappeared, and a man named Blackthorn has usurped his throne. The tyrant rules the land by enforcing the virtues upon the will of the people, corrupting their meaning in the process. His fundamentalist visions led him to create a police state, where failure to adhere to the virtues is punishable by death. Behind Blackthorn are the three Shadowlords, anti-thesis to the three principles of Truth, Love, and Courage. The Avatar must understand their meaning and origins, find a way to defeat them, rescue Lord British, and restore the former ethical principles of Britannia.[CR]Ultima V uses the basics of the Ultima IV engine, an overhead perspective for the map of Britannia and its towns, and a rosette-compass 3D view for the dungeons. The battle system also resembles that of the previous game, with separate battle screens and navigation of character icons in turn-based style. Many of the gameplay elements of the predecessor return, including the complex spell system (reagents must be bought in order to cast spells), recruitable party members, moongates that teleport the party between locations, various means of transportation (horses, ships, etc., with the notable addition of a magic carpet), and so on. Character creation based on morally ambiguous questions and basic leveling up system have been preserved as well. In comparison to the predecessor, the classes have been reduced to four.[CR]Additional challenges include navigating characters through the Underworld, a vast underground area containing many hazards; random presence of Shadowlords in the cities, which influences the behavior of their inhabitants, making them run away, steal from, or attack the Avatar; inscriptions in a runic alphabet that must be deciphered by the player, and others.[CR]The game has a noticeably more detailed world than any of its predecessors; the towns are much larger, with many unique buildings and objects represented graphically. Ultima V introduces physical interaction with the game world: many objects can be pushed or pulled, the main character can sit down on a chair (which is graphically shown), etc. It also incorporates a day/night cycle and schedules for non-playable characters: for example, it is impossible to shop at night because the shopkeepers are sleeping. Dialogues with NPCs have been enhanced, featuring more unique and detailed conversation topics.</plot>

		<plot>Several years after having restored Lord British to his rightful position as the monarch of Britannia, the Avatar is captured by demon-like creatures and placed on a sacrificial altar. His friends Iolo, Shamino and Dupre appear just in time to save him. In the Britannia castle, the Avatar learns that his abductors were gargoyles, a race of enigmatic creatures who have recently invaded Britannia and occupied the shrines of Virtue. As the Avatar embarks on a quest to liberate Britannia, he begins to gain insight into the gargoyles' true motives, and realizes that it is his duty to achieve peace and understanding between the two races.[CR]Ultima VI is notable for having a fully continuous world. There is no "world map" in the game; all the locations are seamlessly connected to each other, turning the game world into an open environment. Compared to the previous installments in the series, the game focuses more on quests and exploration rather than on combat. The latter no longer involves separate screens; battles occur during exploration, without any transitions. The turn-based system from the previous games has been preserved.[CR]The interface has been re-designed, the original key-bound commands co-existing with selectable command icons and mouse-based interaction. The game world is more detailed than in the previous games, with a large number of various objects that can be manipulated or added to the inventory. Conversations are more extended, with a wider selection of topics, including many personal ones unique to specific characters. The player is also able to conduct extensive conversations with the Avatar's companions, as well as split the party and control the characters separately. Some important topics may be highlighted during text display, to facilitate further dialogue, which requires the player to type the desired conversation topics.[CR]Like in the predecessors, the player is free to explore the game world from the beginning of the game, and visit locations in any order. Following the main quest and obtaining specific items and information is necessary to complete the story; however, the player can also opt to bypass a large part of it by using previous knowledge of the game or outside help. The FM Towns version has full voice acting for all the conversations, in English and in Japanese.</plot>

		<plot>The age of peace has come to an end...[CR]For many years, the inhabitants of the country Ellzeria enjoyed a peaceful, prosperous life, protected by the goddess Ell. But the island nation of Seljild, led by demonic warlocks, began to conquer one Ellzerian city after another. To protect Duma, the heart of the land, the knight Tristram fought valiantly, but was heavily wounded in battle. Mel, a young female magician from Asrafil, has tended to his wounds, and after three months Tristram is healthy again, ready to enter a decisive battle against the forces of Seljild.[CR]Vain Dream is a RPG with traditionally Japanese emphasis on story and characters, as well as simple game mechanics and mostly linear progression. However, combat is handled differently in this game than in most other Japanese RPGs, and similarly to Emerald Dragon (made by the same company); still turn-based, it allows free movement on the battle field, calculating the amount of turns without displaying them, thus creating an illusion of real-time battles. Enemies usually appear in groups and are visibly walking on screen in hostile locations.</plot>

		<plot>The land of Kureia enjoyed a peaceful existence, until the beautiful, but deadly Goddess of Darkness decided to make it her own land, imposing a rule of terror on its people. Finally, the Golden Dragon of the Sun and the Silver Dragon of the Moon interfered. In a titanic battle, they perished together with the evil goddess. To protect further safety of Kureia, 108 dragons descended onto the Earth. The new age of peace lasted until a mysterious knight entered the shrine of the Ice Dragon, killing the guards and the dragon himself. A young hunter named Warrick, together with his friends, must find out who did this. The quest for peace begins...[CR]Vain Dream 2 is not directly related to its predecessor story-wise, but shares with it its gameplay mechanics. The Japanese style of its RPG system is evident in linear story progression, emphasis on characterization of party members (up to five members, as opposed to three in the previous game), and automatic leveling up. However, as in the first Vain Dream, there are no random battles, and the turn-based combat system allows free movement on the battle field, creating an illusion of real-time combat. The player has direct control only over the party leader; the rest are controlled by AI, but can be assigned general strategies. Leveling up of weapons is possible, if a character keeps using a specific type of weapon in battles.</plot>

The first follows the sexual escapades of a female student who seduces her schoolmates; the second mainly focuses on a treatment of a particular kind received by a man from a female doctor and nurse in a hospital; the third tells the story of a young girl who discovers her sexuality and eventually gets married.[CR]The first story has no gameplay of any kind. The second has a few screens with an adventure-like point-and-click interface. The third is built like a visual novel: at certain points the player is prompted to make a choice that would scarcely affect the main story but add or subtract certain sexual scenes instead.</plot>

		<plot>The vampire lord Kairn has murdered his father and brothers so he could inherit control of the valley. Ever since he's used his powers to cut off contact with the outside world, Kairn has been living it up, torturing the villagers with madness and death, feeding off of them like livestock and turning the village women into his personal vampiress servants. Meanwhile, the villagers are miserable, as every day they face the possibility of either being devoured by werewolves, gnawed on by zombies, driven into stark raving lunatics, or turned into vampires by Kairn and his posse.[CR]A cargo pilot's plane is shot down by a mysterious force while flying over a remote valley in Romania. A helpful village girl named Deirdre rescues him from the crash and takes him to her father Kiril, who informs the pilot that his arrival via plane crash marks him as the chosen one who is prophesied to destroy Kairn. Since Kairn has cut off all ways out of the valley, the only way he is going to leave is, as the old saying goes, over his dead body. That's not going to be very easy, however. Wild animals and unnatural creatures roam the countryside. While some villagers will help the hero to rid them of Kairn, others have been driven mad with despair and by the valley's oppressive aura, causing them to commit unspeakable acts or otherwise act in an unhelpful manner. Even the most trusted allies may turn out to have a few skeletons in the closet...[CR][I]Veil of Darkness[/I] is an isometric adventure game with action-based combat and light role-playing elements. Most of the game is dedicated to exploring the game world in a fairly open-ended fashion, gathering information and items. Puzzle-solving is conversation- and inventory-based; many battles are also designed in a puzzle-like manner, with the hero being able to defeat certain enemies only with specific weapons. Heavy inventory management and status ailments to take care of contribute to the game's RPG angle.</plot>

		<plot>Viewpoint is a top-down orthographic perspective game in the tradition of Zaxxon. The PlayStation and Saturn versions feature 3D rendered graphics with texture maps, unlike the other versions which primarily feature shaded polygons.[CR]One or two players (in hot-seat or cooperative mode) control a spaceship equipped with a laser cannon which can be charged (by holding the shooting button down) for a stronger blast. Besides the main weapon, three special weapons are available: a wall of fire which wipes the screen up in a wave, a nova-like blast and a circle of spherical-green homing missiles.</plot>

		<plot>[I]Viper GTS[/I] is a direct sequel to one of the stories included in Viper V-6, namely [I]The Devil Came[/I]. In that story a frustrated man named Ogawa summoned the female demon Carrera and had to have sex with her until she was too tired to claim his soul. Now Carrera is back to hell, but the bored Ogawa summons her again. Only this time, she brings a partner: another sexy female demon named Mercedes. So now Ogawa has to satisfy their sexual needs. But the happy orgy is interrupted by the appearance of a new face - an angel from Heaven...[CR]Like other Viper games, [I]Viper GTS[/I] is very heavy on sexual content, to the point of being entirely pornographic. The sex scenes are animated. The gameplay is, per Viper tradition, reduced to occasional choice-making. Most of the times one of the choices is correct while the other leads to Game Over; however, there are a few parts where it is possible to slightly branch the story line (which in reality means viewing a different sex scene).</plot>

		<plot>The third Viper has the same structure as the two previous entries: three unrelated stories with little interaction, but many animated sex scenes.[CR]The stories this time are: * [I]Northern Lights[/I] describes a competition between two young apprentices of kendo. The protagonist, a young boy, is challenging the girl Asuka, who claims to be better than him. He needs to practice in order to win, especially because Asuka promised him she will do whatever he wants if he defeats her...[CR] * [I]Children's Play[/I] tells the story of a teenage girl named Yuki, who is in love with an older school mate. One morning she goes to school, only to discover that someone has made pictures of her masturbating to the boy's photo...[CR] * [I]Read Under[/I] follows the adventures of a team of three female soldiers who have to infiltrate the base of an evil robot simply known as "Boss". One of them is captured, and the other two have to save her at all costs.[CR]Of the three stories, only "Northern Lights" has interaction. The two others are composed of text, pictures, and animated scenes, without any input from the player but pressing the Enter button to see the next scene. "Northern Lights" has a few branching points, during which the player has to choose a course of action for the hero. Some of these choices lead to Game Over.</plot>

		<plot>Yet another entry in the Viper series, [I]Viper V-12[/I] exploits the same format all the previous entries followed: there are three unrelated short stories which mostly consist of animated sex scenes, with some interaction here and there.[CR]Here are the stories: * [I]Future Investigator Bravan[/I]: Bravan is a powerful warrior clad in power armor, who fights for human beings in and has only one weakness: his pretty female comrades. A group of demons called "Donar", led by the mischievous female doppelganger Colonel Gel, decide to use the shape-shifting powers of the commander to lure Bravan to their lair.[CR] * [I]Angel Dust[/I]: Kate and Julia, two cosmic rangers, attack a space pirate ship and board it, hoping to steal treasures and to become rich. But they were not careful enough when they entered the ship without any precautions: the space pirates had other plans for the young girls...[CR] * [I]Magical Gambler[/I]: A young child has a dream which becomes reality: two cute flying creatures appear in front of her and give her a magic rod. However, when the girl uses the rod, she miraculously turns into a young and sexy woman. She decides to use the powers of the rod for her own greed, and becomes Chiyomi - the Queen of Gambling...[CR]This time, all three stories have some interactive parts, although they are more developed in "Bravan" than in the others, which are very straight-forward. "Bravan" offers a short sequence which requires the player to move the mouse or arrow keys to spot a target on a picture; there are also several wrong choices that lead to Game Over in this story.</plot>

		<plot>[I]Viper V-6[/I] is the first in the long-running Viper series of animated adult games. It contains three separate stories: * [I]The Devil Came[/I] tells the story of a teenager named Ogawa, who was unpopular in his class and summoned a demon to exact revenge. But the demon turned out to be female, so his wishes naturally assume a different direction...[CR] * [I]Afternoon[/I] describes a scene during a beauty contest. The defeated participant thinks that she was unfairly judged, but her fury at the winner turns, in front of the amazed spectators, into erotic desire...[CR] * [I]Double Impact[/I] features two young female detectives, Miho and Kumi, who pretend to search for jobs as maids in order to infiltrate a mansion in which mysterious disappearances have been taking place.[CR]All the three stories are very short and can perhaps be better described as "scenes"; the entire game can be completed within several minutes. The interaction is reduced to absolute minimum, with an occasion decision to make, and is available only in [I]The Devil Came[/I] (in which it is also possible to die if the player makes a wrong decision); the two other stories are non-interactive, the only input being pressing the return key to advance to the next scene. What sets "Viper V-6" (and the whole series) apart from most other Japanese adult games - beside the "three stories in one" concept - is the fact that most of its sex scenes are animated.</plot>

		<plot>The second entry in Sogna's long-running Viper franchise, [I]Viper V-8[/I] has the same format as its predecessor: three separate short stories with minimal interaction and animated sex scenes.[CR]The three stories are: * [I]Friday the 18th[/I]: Obviously, a parody on horror movies, telling the story of three young girls who were sexually assaulted by mysterious masked men when camping near a forest.[CR] * [I] Demon's Night[/I] is set in medieval times and describes a battle of three young heroes against a vicious demon. One of them is killed in battle, while the other (a girl) is captured by the demon; the remaining warrior, a young man named Ryu, has to rescue his friend.[CR] * [I] Alien Wars[/I] takes place in the future. A young space pilot named Sylvie is ambushed and captured by aliens who have nothing else in mind but to have sex with her...[CR]There is some rudimentary interaction in all the three stories: "Friday the 18th" allows the player to switch from one heroine to another (even though there is only one correct way to do that); "Demon's Night" has a scene with pseudo-RPG turn-based combat (pre-determined results); both "Demon's Night" and "Alien Wars" offer some menu-based choices to make, some of which will lead to Game Over.</plot>

		<plot>The space ship Monotros has returned after receiving an SOS call to save his home world (Volfied) from alien invaders and has to defeat a different boss and his minions in each level. Volfied is very similar to Qix -- the player takes control of an ship/object whose purpose is to roam the screen, forming shapes and removing them from the play field. By way of reward, a picture is gradually revealed in the removed areas of the screen. The borders of the area which the player has not cleared become the border of the area the player's pointer can move along. When not cutting the ship is protected by a shield the shield decreases over time and when it hits zero the enemies can also killl you when not cutting.[CR]The player's object must avoid contact with any of the enemies which float around the screen, as this will weaken and eventually destroy it. Barriers limit which parts of the border boxes can be formed through. The goal is to clear 80% or more of the screen, and each additional percent adds bonus points. Most levels contain power-up blocks these power-ups can be claimed when the area around it is removed. Possible power-ups are increased speed (S), time frees for the enemies (T), pause you shield from counting down (P), a laser to shoot the smaller enemies (L), all smaller enemies are killed instantly (C) and a weapon to kill the boss (a red tomato only found in blocks with the red light).[CR]This game allows for one or two player games in three difficulty levels, but offers no passwords or saved games across its numerous levels.</plot>

		<plot>God had created the world with Light and Shadow completing each other, maintaining the balance of events. The Tribe of Light are humans, living on the surface; the Tribe of Shadow has many different creatures, who dwell underground. To sustain peace and harmony between the tribes, a huge stone tablet called Words Worth was erected.[CR]But one day, someone has shattered the tablet. Both Tribes blamed each other and began a bloody war that has been raging for hundred years. Finally, the king of the Shadow Tribe sends his son, the brave Astral, to find out what really happened to the tablets, and to restore peace in the world.[CR]Words Worth is primarily a first-person dungeon crawler. Even though there are a few "friendly" areas, such as a town where the hero can rest and buy supplies, most of the game is spent in dungeon-like, maze-like areas (with an auto-map feature). There is no party in the game: Astral has to face the enemies alone. The enemies appear randomly, and the combat is turn-based. The game has scenes with nudity and sexual situations.</plot>

The options you can do in each location are the same: you can question witnesses, look up evidence reports, or contact Crime Net to receive additional information about the suspect such as features, hair and eye color, auto, and sport. If you're lucky, you can contact other informants like Bart Samson and Vinnie the Squealer.[CR]Once you get enough information about the suspect, you can transmit this information to Warren the Warrant Robot to make him get a warrant for you. If you're not sure about the information you've entered, you can look up the dossiers on each suspect.[CR]Unlike the rest of the [I]Carmen Sandiego[/I] games, you're given a quiz just before you get promoted, requiring you to look up the reference that came with the game. If you keep get promoted, you may find yourself in the hall of fame.[CR]Locations include (but not limited to) Kathmandu, Dar-es-Salaam, Baghdad, Manila, Lima, Port Moresby, Singapore, New Delhi, and Tokyo. You can also travel to ACME HQ in San Francisco, but the only thing you can do is start a new case, or assign a new detective.</plot>

The game could be played either in split-screen, network, serial or modem modes and was one of the first multi-player 3D space sims.[CR]The game was ported to the FM Towns and PC-98 Japanese computers, with modem play completely dropped and leaving only the split screen multiplayer, but are otherwise mostly identical to the PC release</plot>

		<plot>It is said the the Cosmic Forge is a magical pen possessing an enormous power: whatever is written with it instantly becomes true. A group of explorers ventures into the castle that where the king, the queen, and the wizard who created the pen used to dwell. Nobody knows what has been happening there for the last hundred years, since nobody dares to enter the haunted castle. As the heroes step in, the doors behind them close forever. They are left alone to discover the truth about the Cosmic Forge and the drama that occurred between the castle's inhabitants.[CR][I]Bane of the Cosmic Forge[/I] is the sixth entry in the Wizardry series. While retaining the basic premise of creating a party of up to six adventurers to roam first-person dungeons and fight enemies in turn-based combat, this installment contains numerous enhancements and new features. It is the first game in the series to feature full color graphics and a mouse-driven interface. Combat options are more detailed, with precise weapon moves (such as thrust and bash) available. Magic is divided into six different schools, the spellcaster's powers increasing if he or she concentrates on one of them. Picking locks or disarming traps by thief-like classes is done actively by participating in a simple minigame. Characters can learn skills unique to their class when leveling up. These skills range from weapon proficiencies to field abilities that can be used outside of combat.[CR]In addition to the traditional races of humans, elves, dwarves, hobbits, and gnomes, the player can choose between the Lizardman, the cat-like Felpurr, the canine Rawulf, the pixie-like Faerie, the intimidating Dracon, and the furry Mook. Each race has its own strengths and weaknesses, as well as predispositions to certain classes. Exotic character classes such as Valkyrie, Alchemist, Psionic, Ninja, Samurai, and Monk are also available during character creation, though they require a higher amount of bonus points received during the initial dice roll. It is also possible for characters to switch to another class during the course of the game.[CR]Conversations with NPCs have been extended, the player being able to talk about various topics with the same character. The game also features a branching storyline: depending on the player's choice to believe or mistrust a key character, the plot will split into different directions, resulting in several different endings. The entire game takes place within the castle and its surroundings, without the possibility to travel back to the town or create other characters after the game has started. Unlike the previous entries, it is possible to save the game anywhere manually.</plot>

		<plot>[I]Crusaders of the Dark Savant[/I] is the seventh installment of the [I]Wizardry[/I] series and a direct sequel to Bane of the Cosmic Forge. In the end of the previous game, the party of heroes finally acquired the Cosmic Forge. However, before they were able to decide what to do with it, it was taken away by a servant of the Cosmic Lords, the cyborg Aletheides. It appears that the Cosmic Forge was in fact a clue to the location of the Astral Dominae, the artifact of life, somewhere on the planet Guardia, which has now been revealed to the universe.[CR]The heroes then travel to Guardia, which is populated by many races and organizations with their own agendas, including the rhinoceros-like Imperial Umpani Federation and the spidery T'Rang affiliated with a malevolent being known as the Dark Savant, whose goal is to get rid of the Cosmic Lords. All these factions are looking for the Astral Dominae, finding which is the primary goal of the game. Depending on the decisions made by the player in the previous game (should he opt to import the party from there), the game will have different openings and begin in different locations. However, regardless of the initial premise, the player is free to follow or betray whatever faction he was supposed to be allied with.[CR]The gameplay system is very similar to that of its predecessor, retaining the races, the classes, the skills and the magic system it introduced to the series. The trademark first-person exploration and turn-based combat are present as well. Unlike the previous games, [I]Crusaders of the Dark Savant[/I] allows the player to explore towns and vast forest areas between them, in addition to several large dungeons situated in different areas of the game world. Many NPCs have their own agendas and may move between locations as well, and even obtain crucial items themselves if the player-controlled party is not quick enough, forcing the player to change plans. The exotic setting contains elements of science fiction on top of the traditional fantasy background. Like in the previous game, encounters, events, as well as the heroes' reflections upon them are described through text messages.[CR]A few skills have been added, including swimming and climbing, as well as diplomacy. The latter reflects the more important role dialogues and interaction with NPCs play in the game compared to the previous installments of the series. A mapping skill has been added, which, if learned, displays - for the first time in the computer releases of Wizardry games - an automap on top of the exploration screen. Skills are increased with repeated usage and the characters now receive separate bonus points for each category (weapon, physical, and academia). Like before, magic is divided into four schools (Psionics, Alchemy, Theology, and Thaumaturgy) and six elemental categories.</plot>

		<plot>After L'Kbreth's Orb was used to bring peace back to the land of Llylgamyn, a new threat emerges in the region. Strange malevolent energies have been spotted beneath the Temple of Sages. These energies - called the "Maelstrom" by the local inhabitants - can be sealed by a person known as the Gatekeeper. Unfortunately, the latter has been imprisoned by a mysterious power or person only referred to as SORN. A party of brave adventurers seeks out the high priest G'bli Gedook, the guardian of L'Kbreth's Orb, who explains to them that they have to release the Gatekeeper and eventually vanquish the evil at its core.[CR]Wizardry V: Heart of the Maelstrom returns to the gameplay concept of the first three installments of the series, abandoning the unusual premise of its predecessor. As in the initial games, the gameplay consists of exploring a vast maze-like dungeon with a custom party created and outfitted in the game's only town. Though visually very similar to their predecessors, the game's dungeon is no longer limited to a square layout. Several tweaks have been applied to the gameplay system, including range rating for all weapons (allowing back row attacks), a more prominent role for the Thief class (who can now hide in shadows, backstab enemies, and open locks), etc.[CR]The game is more puzzle-oriented than the preceding entries, requiring the player to obtain a larger quantity of crucial items needed for its completion. It is the first installment in the series with friendly NPCs who can be encountered in the dungeon and interacted with by typing keywords. Also for the first time, the game allows - but does not require - importing characters from a previous scenario.</plot>

The hatred between men and women grew, until it resulted in a bloody war. Having superior physical strength, men were victorious for a while - until female demons offered their help to women's army. Men's army was nearly destroyed. It was at that time that the hero, named Leopard Chateau-Lyon, appeared in Wandante. He is the only hope of the men, the one who will have to defeat the demonic women and to bring peace to both genders.[CR][I]Wonpara Wars[/I] is a strategy board game which is somewhat similar to chess, but with much simpler rules (and decidedly much simpler than the Japanese chess, [I]shogi[/I]). Some pieces are identical to those of Western chess (bishop), or move similarly to Western chess pieces, but have different names ("magicians" who move similarly to rooks); "soldiers" can walk in all directions, including backwards. There are also treasure chess scattered around the board, which can be captured by both the player's and the enemy army.[CR]The battles are dictated by the plot; there are cut scenes before and after each battle, and they take place in different locations. The enemy army has a "boss" piece, unique for each battle. The battle is won when one of the sides has captured enough enemy pieces. Whenever the player's piece captures an enemy piece, a hentai scene occurs, typically showing a girl taking off her battle clothes.</plot>

		<plot>The protagonist of the first game, Leopard Chateau-Lyon, finds himself wandering in a forest, having no memory of his own past, except his name. He is captured by two female warriors and is brought to their queen. It appears that there are only women in this country; when the hero says he is a man, the queen rejoices, telling him about an ancient legend that prophesied the advent of a creature named [I]man[/I], who will save their country from the ruthless queen of the neighboring land. The hero has to prove himself worthy of his heroic status and to defeat the enemy forces that threaten the country.[CR][I]Wonpara Wars II[/I] follows the same principle as its predecessor: defeat the enemy army in chess-like battles, watch the cut scene, advance to the next stage. The rules for the board game itself are more complex. There are new pieces, taken from Western chess (knight) as well as original ones (ninja). The rules differ from known chess variants in several ways (random treasure chests can change the movement rules of a piece; many types of pieces can move only forward, etc.). The pieces also differ by gender: knights look like men, bishops like women, etc. Each army has a "master" piece, which represents the hero and the enemy general, correspondingly. Once a general is captured, the battle is won. There are also unique enemy pieces, one for each battle.[CR]Like the first game, capturing an enemy piece is accompanied by hentai pictures. Since there are male and female pieces, different pictures are displayed depending on which player piece has performed the capture.</plot>

		<plot>[I]Wrestle Angels 3[/I] is, like its predecessors in the series, a turn-based wrestling-themed game. The player takes the role of the manager of a new company that represents and trains young wrestlers, guiding them to participate in an all-female league. Wrestlers can be selected and hired either directly by following the league's records, or by scouting the city and recruiting suitable candidates. Afterwards the wrestlers can be trained by choosing and investing points into particular moves. It is also possible to send them on vacations. Most actions in that preparation mode cost action points (AP); running out of them ends the turn.[CR]The manager can then send the wrestlers to participate in tournaments. The actual wrestling matches can be set in auto, with their outcome determined by the wrestlers' parameters. However, it is also possible to control them manually, choosing each move from a deck of randomly dealt cards. Moves include attacks, special attacks of various kinds, charging, healing, etc.[CR]There is also an exhibition mode where the player can select any of the 48 available wrestlers and take them to single or tag-team matches.</plot>

After that, the tournament begins.[CR]As before, the wrestling matches are turn-based, both sides choosing a move from several available ones.

But one day, a messenger brings terrible news: the castle of Farland was attacked, the king, the princess, and countless soldiers brutally slain. Zomu Dizae, the third and the final demon commander of the dark world Zekisis (Latok has defeated the other two, Badu and Gospel), has arrived. He is aided by the treacherous Necromancer, who turned the soldiers of Farland into monsters. Will Latok be able to defeat the evil once again?[CR][I]Xak III: The Eternal Recurrence[/I] is an action RPG, similar in gameplay style to its predecessors, but also incorporating some elements first introduced in Tower of Gazel, such as the ability to jump and having companions (although this feature is much more limited here). Jumping ability is crucial in many cases, as there are obstacles that can only be avoided by jumping over them. Latok starts at level 50, but still can gain experience points and become stronger. A new (and very useful) feature is hit points restoration, which occurs when Latok is standing still. To counter that, enemies can re-spawn, which means that there aren't many completely safe areas in the game.</plot>

		<plot>Many years ago, the dark lord Sauron forged the One Ring to control the races of the Middle Earth. He was defeated by the human prince Isildur, who took the ring to himself. But such was the evil power of the ring that it brought misfortune to whoever dared to bear it, corrupting their souls. Eventually, the ring ended up by Frodo Baggins, a peaceful hobbit who was unaware of his possession's true nature. Realizing that the only way to be free of the ring's power would be to destroy it, the wizard Gandalf tells Frodo to carry it to Sauron's land, Mordor, and throw it into the lava rivers of the Orodruin volcano, thus saving Middle Earth from destruction.[CR][I]J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, Vol. I[/I] is a fantasy role-playing game based on [I]The Fellowship of the Ring[/I], the first volume of the [I]Lord of the Rings[/I] book trilogy by J.R.R. Tolkien. The events of the game follow those depicted in the book rather closely, though a few characters and occurrences are not present, and many quests have been added. Characters belonging to various races and nations join Frodo on his quest; these include key figures from the book as well as several characters unique to the game.[CR]The game is rather open-ended, allowing the player to roam vast top-down environments and undertake side missions in addition to the main storyline, which must be followed in order to complete the game. Combat takes place in the same area as exploration, and is turn-based. The player has full control over the actions of the characters in the party. These characters can also be swapped, equipped with weapons and armor, and use various skills (individual and shared), such as sneaking, perception (to find hidden items), unique "words of power", and others.[CR]Unlike the vast majority of role-playing games, there are no experience points or character levels in the game. Player-controlled party becomes stronger by obtaining better equipment and items, learning new abilities, and recruiting stronger characters that would help the weak hobbits to survive encounters with Nazguls and other dangerous creatures. There are optional ways to access major locations, and much of the combat in the game can be avoided.[CR]The CD version of the game features cutscenes taken from the animated [I]Lord of the Rings[/I] movie by Ralph Bakshi. The original floppy release often required the players to read story-related text from the manual; the CD version inserts this text into the game itself at the appropriate places. It also adds an automapping feature to the game.</plot>

		<plot>A seemingly ordinary Japanese high school student named Yumimi Yoshizawa sees a strange dream about a unicorn couple in a magical land. When one of the unicorns suddenly falls through a hole in the ground, Yumimi wakes up, realizing she has fallen out of the bed as well. The following day brings more strange occurrences, such as mysterious hopping blobs and a strange girl who professes her love to Yumimi. Eventually Yumimi and her friends realize that all these events are connected and that it lies in their power to protect our world from monsters.[CR]Though not based on a manga or anime, Yumimi Mix has characteristic anime-style plot and visuals, and is built like an interactive cartoon movie with animation and voice-overs. The player is sometimes prompted to select an action or a response from a pop-up menu out of two or more available ones. These choices lead to different scenes, though the overall story remains the same. There is no possibility of a Game Over in the game.</plot>

		<plot>[I]Zan II: Towns Special[/I] is an installment in the Zan series primarily based on Zan: Kagerō no Toki. The setting (Japanese Sengoku period) and main gameplay mechanics are identical. However, this version allows the player to recreate specific scenarios from the historical era, taking place between 1550 and 1600. Four scenarios of varied difficulty are available.[CR]Like other Zan games, this entry is a turn-based grand strategy game similar to Koei's Romance of the Three Kingdoms series. The player takes control of a ruler or general in a chosen province of Japan, trying to govern his own country by keeping its inhabitants happy, and gaining the upper hand in the struggle for dominance, be it through diplomatic manoeuvres or military actions. Combat takes place on separate isometric screens and allows the player to input detailed commands for the army.</plot>

		<plot>Naoto Matsumoto is a young man who suffers from a peculiar memory loss: he does not remember his life before he was fourteen. Apparently both his parents died, and he was taken in by another family. On one rainy day, during a trip through the countryside, Naoto's car reaches a dead end on the road, and he and his stepsister are invited by a maid to spend the night in a large secluded mansion. Naoto witnesses increasingly strange and violent events and begins to recollect his lost memories.[CR][I]Zatsuon Ryōiki[/I] is an adult psychological horror game. The gameplay follows the visual novel format. There are many instances which prompt the player to choose a location to go to or make another decision. These choices lead to different scenes and eventually different endings. There are eighteen endings in this visual novel, many of which depicting violent death. The game keeps track of the player's progress and encourages multiple replays to uncover the entire story.</plot>
