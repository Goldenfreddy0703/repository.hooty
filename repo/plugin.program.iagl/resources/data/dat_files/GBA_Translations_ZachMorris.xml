    <plot>Dragon Quest Monsters: Caravan Heart is the third installment in the well[CR]known Dragon Quest Monsters series. It's the only game in the Monsters series[CR]that didn't get an official English localization. This was the very last game[CR]published by Enix before they merged with Square. Follow Prince Kiefer (one of[CR]the heroes of Dragon Quest VII) on his quest to help a friend find a cure for[CR]his parent's illness. You'll travel in a growing Caravan, full of trained[CR]guard monsters and a whole bunch of human party members. Features: * Great[CR]graphics * Classic Dragon Quest Soundtrack * 200 Monsters * Monster[CR]Reformations using the hearts of befriended monsters * Fight both with[CR]Monsters and Human party members * 22 Classes for the human party members *[CR]Lot's of depth and strategic possibilities * Light-hearted main quest * A LOT[CR]of optional bonus content after finishing the main story[CR]Read[CR]Me:[CR]-------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Dragon Quest Monsters: Caravan Heart [CR] English translation Copyright[CR]2008[CR] Released on March 16, 2008 [CR] The Translation Team [CR]http://kaioshin.romhacking.net[CR]-------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]1.

Introduction[CR] After almost 2 years of labor, many ups and downs, and[CR]more than a[CR] good dose of stress and frustration, Im proud to finally[CR]present a complete,[CR] English translation for Dragon Quest Monsters: Caravan[CR]Heart.[CR] [CR] It has been hard work, but it was also a work of dedication[CR]and love.[CR] The whole staff that worked on this project invested hundreds of[CR]hours upon[CR] hours into this game. We are proud of our work and believe that[CR]we delivered[CR] a quality translation that doesnt need to hide behind[CR]commercial translations.[CR] We hope youll enjoy this excellent game as much[CR]as we did. Have fun![CR]-------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]3.

Instructions[CR] [CR] The translation is being distributed as an IPS patch.[CR]You can apply it to a[CR] clean ROM image of the game with an IPS patcher like[CR]Lunar IPS.[CR] [CR] If youre going to play this translation on an emulator, we[CR]recommend no$GBA.[CR] Its the most accurate GBA emulator and tested to work[CR]with the translation[CR] perfectly. You will need a working GBA BIOS image for[CR]no$GBA.[CR] VBA version 1.8.0beta or newer should run the game as well, but[CR]its not[CR] tested. Earlier versions will have timing problems that might[CR]result in[CR] glitches during the game (for example a flickering world[CR]map).[CR] [CR] The game has been tested on real GBA hardware too and runs[CR]fine. Depending[CR] on your flashcart you might run into flickering on the[CR]world map though. At[CR] the time of release we havent investigated the issue[CR]too closely yet, but it[CR] appears to be related to the flash cards speed.[CR]The translation has been[CR] tested and confirmed to work flawlessly with an[CR]EZ-Flash V 3in1 Expansion Pack.[CR] [CR] DO NOT ask us where to get the ROM or[CR]a BIOS image. You will be ignored and/or[CR] banned from our sites. Obtaining[CR]a ROM image without owning the original[CR] Japanese cartridge is illegal. If[CR]you pirate the game to use with our[CR] translation, the translation team cant[CR]be hold responsible for your actions.[CR] [CR] DO NOT distribute a pre-patched[CR]ROM image. DO NOT distribute our patch without[CR] this release note file. We[CR]worked 2 years on this project, and demand at least[CR] this much respect for[CR]our work. [CR] [CR] DO NOT use our work as a base for any other works[CR](especially new translations)[CR] without the translation teams consent. You[CR]can contact us through the [CR] project website and request permission and[CR]well gladly give it.[CR]-------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]5. About the Game[CR] [CR] Dragon Quest Monsters: Caravan Heart is the third[CR]installment in the well[CR] known Dragon Quest Monsters series. At the time of[CR]this translations release,[CR] its the only game in the Monsters series that[CR]didnt get an official English[CR] localization.[CR] Caravan Heart was the very[CR]last game published by Enix themselves, right before[CR] they merged with[CR]Squaresoft. Its assumed that the game never saw an English[CR] release due to[CR]the companys restructuring at that time.[CR] [CR] Announced in 2002[CR]simultaneously with Dragon Quest VIII, it acts as a sort of[CR] prequel to[CR]Dragon Quest VII. The game follows Prince Kiefer on a grand[CR] adventure in[CR]which he becomes the leader of a caravan. [CR] [CR] Unlike the previous Dragon[CR]Quest Monsters games, the game isnt entirely[CR] focused on monsters alone.[CR]The caravan is also filled with several human party[CR] members, which will[CR]aid you in your quest. There are 22 different character[CR] classes, with[CR]completely different abilities. Together with your guard[CR] monsters, the[CR]game offers for a practically endless variety of possible [CR] strategies and[CR]formations.[CR] [CR] The monster breeding of the previous game was reworked[CR]into monster[CR] reformations this time. Instead of breeding new monsters you[CR]collect hearts[CR] of defeated monsters and combine them to reform your[CR]monsters into new forms.[CR] The system offers a great deal of freedom for[CR]experimentation and collecting.[CR] [CR] With nice graphics and a classical[CR]Dragon Quest soundtrack the game offers[CR] everything a Dragon Quest fan[CR]could wish for. Caravan Heart has a lengthy main[CR] quest that will keep you[CR]busy for at least 30-40 hours. After that youll be[CR] treated to a whole new[CR]quest in which you can easily spend over 200[CR] hours and more.[CR]-------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]6. Translation Reflections[CR] I had played and beaten Dragon Quest Monsters:[CR]Caravan Heart long before I[CR] encountered Kaioshins website. When I did, I[CR]knew that I had to lend a hand.[CR] Translating an RPG is a huge task,[CR]especially one as big as Dragon Quest.[CR] There seemed to be a lot of[CR]misunderstandings about this game. Most gamers[CR] didnt even seem to know[CR]that the title of the game was Caravan -Heart-, not[CR] "Caravan Hearts!" (Its[CR]a personal pet-peeve of mine!)[CR] When I offered my help to Kaioshin, I did[CR]it under the condition of anonymity.[CR] Still, Im just an ordinary fan; Im[CR]not involved with the industry or anything.[CR] (Sorry, conspiracy theorists!)[CR]My names Tom. Ive done other translation work[CR] under pseudonyms before, but[CR]theres no use in hiding under nicknames, really.[CR] To be perfectly honest, I[CR]didnt want to get involved with the "community"[CR] side of translating. I[CR]didnt want to have to answer to anybody, because[CR] any translation is bound[CR]to rub people the wrong way. I really dont like[CR] the bickering and[CR]nitpicking that goes on in the messageboards. I just wanted[CR] to get this[CR]game running in English.[CR] Doing this proved to be quite a difficult task.[CR]You may not realize how[CR] much text is in this game while you play it, but[CR]there are variations on[CR] practically every line spoken by the members of[CR]your caravan (depending[CR] on their age, gender, and job). This means[CR]translating the same line again[CR] in 50 different ways... And thats only for[CR]one line! Sometimes, this felt[CR] like a real test of will-power. Its not all[CR]fun storyline stuff![CR] A lot of sleepless nights went into this one, but[CR]fortunately I managed to[CR] finish it rather quickly. The side effect of[CR]translating from midnight to[CR] 3 AM was that there were some pretty[CR]embarrassing slip-ups now and then. I have[CR] to thank the amazing debug team[CR]for doing such a great job not letting those[CR] errors slip through the[CR]cracks.[CR] I also want to address the issue of standardization, though. There[CR]have been so[CR] many changes to the Dragon Quest series throughout the years[CR]that everybody has[CR] a different opinion about what is the "right" way to go[CR]about translating it.[CR] When Dragon Quest was first introduced in America as[CR]"Dragon Warrior," it was[CR] full of medieval "thou hasts" and "wouldst[CR]thous"... Then it changed to[CR] standard American English... And lately it[CR]has changed to British English...[CR] We all saw monster names changed as[CR]Drakees became Drackys; Red Slimes became[CR] She Slimes. (Not in this[CR]version, though!) So the question arose - what standard[CR] should I use for[CR]this translation? The answer came from the story of the game itself.[CR] It[CR]blends the old with the new... The translation does the same. Many of the[CR]names[CR] will be familiar to fans of previous English releases from the[CR]Dragon Quest Monsters[CR] games. Certain other elements of the new style can[CR]be seen as well... There are also[CR] some unique terms and names that havent[CR]been seen before. The dialog is written[CR] in standard American English.[CR]I know that some people might be frustrated that they would have[CR]translated[CR] a certain element of the game differently, but this would be[CR]the case for[CR] any translation style. There will always be disagreements,[CR]but the bottom line[CR] is that what seemed to be a lost cause is now finally[CR]in English for you to enjoy.[CR] I hope that you enjoy it.[CR] 7. Frequently[CR]Asked Questions[CR] [CR] - How did you choose the monster names?[CR] [CR] As[CR]with every Dragon Quest translation, many people will surely make a great[CR]fit over monster naming. Since the game was the last by Enix, we wanted it[CR]to[CR] have the feel of a classic Dragon Quest game. The monster names are[CR]therefore based on the ones used in the first 2 Dragon Quest Monsters[CR]games.[CR] Where names had been very obviously shortened due to space[CR]constraints we [CR] retranslated them as we saw fit (You will see Bubble[CR]Slimes and not a Babbles).[CR] The names are not open for debate. If they are[CR]a big issue for you, end your[CR] pain by jumping off the next tall[CR]bridge.[CR] [CR] - The Text Speed Option is broken![CR] [CR] No, it isnt. It[CR]doesnt affect the normal dialogs, what it adjusts is the[CR] speed with which[CR]the battle messages scroll automatically. If you set it to[CR] 8, the game[CR]will wait for a button press before it shows the next message[CR] every[CR]time[CR] [CR] - I found a typo/grammar error.[CR] [CR] It happens. The game is[CR]huge and full of randomness. Well never be able to[CR] test it 100%. We did[CR]test it to 99,99%, but were sorry for the remaining[CR] 0,01% regardless. Send[CR]me (KaioShin) a personal message on the[CR] romhacking.net message board and[CR]Ill have it fixed in case there will ever[CR] be a update to the patch. Make[CR]sure you know what you are talking about though.[CR] [CR] - Will there be an[CR]update patch?[CR] [CR] That depends. If a substantial number of problems are[CR]found well probably[CR] release an updated patch later on. If there are only 2[CR]or 3 bugs found, we[CR] wont bother. Given the size of the game and the amount[CR]of randomness, Id[CR] say its likely there will be an update some day.[CR] - I found a place were the dialog window wouldnt disappear after the [CR]dialog was finished.[CR] [CR] Yeah, we know of two places in the game with[CR]this error. Its from the original[CR] game. We didnt fix it, because we didnt[CR]want to decipher the whole event code[CR] just for these two boxes.[CR] [CR] -[CR]There was some text flickering on the skill selection screen[CR] [CR] This can[CR]happen, we are unsure about how rare/common this issue really is. Our[CR] VWF[CR]code is too slow in these situations, since the game redraws the whole[CR]text in VRAM on every single frame. The flickering occurs when the game[CR]cant[CR] finish drawing one frame when the next comes up. We already optimised[CR]our VWF[CR] code extremely well, due to the way the game works we just cant[CR]improve it[CR] anymore. We currently assume this issue is pretty rare.[CR]When we get a new idea on how to resolve this issue it might be fixed in a[CR]later revision of the patch.[CR] [CR] - Luins hair changes to black when I[CR]enter certain areas[CR] This glitch is present in the original game.[CR] [CR] [CR] [CR] </plot>

It should go without saying that[CR]this is a noncommercial fan[CR]translation released under fair use, that all[CR]Suikoden copyrights and[CR]trademarks remain the sole property of Konami, and that[CR]this translation is[CR]only licensed for use in the absence of an official English[CR]release of Card[CR]Stories.[CR]====================[CR]2. Translation[CR]Notes[CR]====================[CR]This is a "tool-assisted" translation into[CR]English; I have limited knowledge of[CR]Japanese, and I made liberal use of[CR]Google Translate. Ordinarily that would[CR]result in quite a mess, but the[CR]games script isnt highly stylized and the plot[CR]closely follows Suikoden II,[CR]so I was able to follow the action. Also, Im not[CR]completely hopeless at[CR]Japanese. Still, this is far from a perfect translation;[CR]a lot of recent[CR]fan efforts have set the bar very high![CR]The translation isnt literal, but[CR]it shouldnt stray far from the original, at[CR]least not intentionally. A few[CR]people felt I was misinterpreting some lines,[CR]and they were right, so while[CR]I fixed those, be forewarned.[CR]The original, incorrect translations of names[CR]like the Zodiac Sword (Star Dragon[CR]Sword) and Mathers (Mazus) have been[CR]retained. In addition, some cards are[CR]bugged in the game and do not[CR]function as their card text would suggest. (For[CR]example, the card South[CR]Window War should prevent all characters with the links[CR]H and I from being[CR]played, but this restriction only applies to the player, not to[CR]the AI.)[CR]These translations have been adjusted to match[CR]gameplay.[CR]================[CR]3. Hacking Notes[CR]================[CR]Most[CR]of the games text is Shift-JIS, except for two large banks of[CR]Huffman-[CR]compressed Shift-JIS. This patch uses a VWF 8x11 font based on the[CR]existing[CR]Roman font, stored internally as ASCII + 0x60. This allowed the use[CR]of[CR]twice as many letters in the same VRAM as the original 11x11 characters.[CR]The[CR]hack doesnt massively overhaul the routine to write the whole alphabet[CR]into[CR]VRAM, as the real bottleneck is the number of objects in OAM.[CR]For[CR]this release, some limited sprite text welding has been implemented in[CR]order[CR]to better fit text and generally make stuff work right. Its still[CR]dotty in[CR]places because a lot of old wiring remained, but its an[CR]improvement over the[CR]last release.[CR]You may encounter occasional sprite[CR]glitches, but they should go away when you[CR]back out of the screen and[CR]return.[CR]==========[CR]4. Credits[CR]==========[CR]Thanks to the hardworking[CR]team at the Suikogaiden Translation Project, led by[CR]Rin-Uzuki and later[CR]Raww Le Klueze, which inspired me to pick this up. Dont[CR]forget to check out[CR]Suikogaiden Vol. 1 and Vol. 2![CR]I heavily referenced Zaltabors translations[CR]of cards for the initial[CR]pass-through - it sped things up[CR]considerably.[CR]ARMIPS (http://www.romhacking.net/utilities/635/) and No$gba[CR](http://nocash.emubase.de/gba.htm) were very useful tools for this[CR]project;[CR]thanks to Kingcom and Martin Korth,[CR]respectively.[CR]==================[CR]5. Version[CR]History[CR]==================[CR]1.00: Patch Complete[CR]- Except for the[CR]attract mode animation, all Japanese text has been translated[CR] and all game[CR]features enabled. Dummied content was restored, allowing 100%[CR]completion.[CR]0.81: Time to Relax[CR]- Some minor upgrades; game is now[CR]completely playable. Forward progress on the[CR] patch is suspended, although[CR]Ill still take major bug reports.[CR]0.80: Two Steps Forward, One Step[CR]Back[CR]- Enough improvements to release a new version. Battle text tweaked[CR]and the[CR] second and third tutorials repaired. The Cafeteria and Recipes in[CR]general[CR] remain a disaster area and are best avoided.[CR]0.751: One Step[CR]Forward, Two Steps Back[CR]- Reverted to 0.70 to get around a stupid crash I[CR]should have fixed. Rebuilding[CR] back to 0.75.[CR]0.75: Crash Fixes[CR]-[CR]Several more memory allocation bugs fixed. Slowly getting the shops[CR]displaying prices better.[CR]- All enemy names and recipe names translated.[CR]This should significantly reduce[CR] or eliminate the crashing in[CR]dungeons.[CR]0.70: Corruption Fixes[CR]- Horrible memory allocation bugs[CR]causing corrupted savestates and inability to[CR] edit the deck fixed. Also a[CR]few minor bugs.[CR]0.41: April Fools![CR]- Initial release 4/1/2012. Playable[CR]to the end with a lot of savestating, but[CR] many[CR]bugs/crashes/mistranslations.[CR]===========[CR]6. Mini-[CR]FAQ[CR]===========[CR]a) Getting the Best Ending[CR]There are three endings to[CR]the game. The more Ending Points you have, the more[CR]you gain access to. You[CR]gain and lose Ending Points based on the responses you[CR]choose. The[CR]"correct" choices are at the end of this mini-faq. Theyre very[CR]generic and[CR]will not spoil you, so feel free to refer to them. If you are[CR]following[CR]along and find youve missed one, dont worry, you can afford to skip[CR]a few -[CR]but be warned, its difficult to get the best ending simply by trusting[CR]your[CR]instincts. Theres always New Game +, though![CR]b) Link Mode[CR]Link Mode is[CR]"weakly supported" (i.e. the text is translated, and it could[CR]theoretically[CR]work, but I havent tested it because setting it up is a pain).[CR]c) A Secret[CR]Character[CR]In the original Japanese release, it was impossible to fully[CR]complete the game,[CR]due to one missing card. That character was apparently[CR]intended to be[CR]distributed through special events and promotions, like Mew[CR]for the original[CR]Pokemon. But, the abysmal sales of Card Stories in Japan[CR]meant nothing ever[CR]materialized. [CR]However, this card is fully[CR]functional, there are hints about this character in[CR]the original release,[CR]and there was even a complete cutscene dummied out. This[CR]character is now[CR]enabled, and it should be possible to get a 100% card file.[CR]Happy[CR]hunting![CR]d) Basic Tips[CR]- Mission and Facility cards let you determine[CR]the rules for a fight, but they[CR]wont help you win. Reducing the number of[CR]these in your deck will let you draw[CR]more characters. Later on in the game,[CR]using high VP missions helps you further[CR]cut back on Mission cards.[CR]-[CR]When you play a mission, or when your opponent plays one, you want a hand[CR]full[CR]of characters. So if youve drawn extra facilities or missions, or even[CR]lousy[CR]characters, consider discarding them until you have your best[CR]squad.[CR]- When you clear a mission, the character you station very rarely[CR]returns to[CR]combat. Theres no mechanic where they have to defend the[CR]mission. However,[CR]that character cannot be played for the rest of the game,[CR]because theyre still[CR]considered in play.[CR]- For that reason, it is[CR]critical that you station cards you wont need later.[CR]Ideally, station cards[CR]you only have one of in your deck; then, station cards[CR]that are weak, or[CR]cards you only have two or three of.[CR]- To use a Unite, play the character[CR]WITHOUT the UNITE text on their card first.[CR]You then get a free play of the[CR]character WITH the UNITE text.[CR]- Cards that discard characters from play,[CR]especially characters of your choice,[CR]are generally very effective. Cards[CR]that return cards to your deck generally[CR]arent.[CR]- At the very beginning,[CR]you will be short on leaders. You may want to swap out[CR]some weak followers[CR]and facilities or missions for any leaders you can find.[CR]- Fleeing a random[CR]battle in a dungeon before it starts only costs a little[CR]potch. But once it[CR]starts, even though you get unlimited continues, theres no[CR]way to escape[CR]except winning. So either save states frequently or be careful[CR]about[CR]picking fights.[CR]- If you can manage to trade five cards in at the Training[CR]center, youll get a[CR]bonus card as a reward. However, be careful about[CR]trading your strongest cards[CR]along the way![CR]e) Advanced Tips[CR]-[CR]Occasionally, having an appropriate card in your deck will trigger an[CR]event[CR]and affect how many VP you need to win. For example, Sierra and the[CR]Star Dragon[CR]Sword are good to bring along against Neclord.[CR]- In dire[CR]situations, consider forgoing missions and facilities altogether and[CR]trying[CR]to piggyback on your opponents mission cards instead. If you have[CR]failed[CR]the fight already and know what missions your opponent will be[CR]playing,[CR]sometimes its easier to try and beat them at their own game.[CR]-[CR]The exception to stationing only weak cards is stationing cards that[CR]provide[CR]bonuses to other cards. Riou is a great card for you early on, but[CR]if you clear[CR]a mission and station him, all Alliance characters get +1 ATT[CR]for the rest of[CR]the game. If you station Jeane, your characters with Runes[CR]get +1 ATT (and if[CR]you put her on the Rune Shop, they get another +1[CR]ATT!).[CR]- You can also try to station cards that are giving you fits, if you[CR]have your[CR]own copy. If you get your Seed stationed on a cleared mission,[CR]you dont have[CR]to deal with him for the rest of the game.[CR]- In general,[CR]despite attempts by the designers to make all the cards[CR]interesting, the[CR]game strongly favors cards with high base stats. Unless they[CR]directly[CR]remove your opponents characters, cards with low ATT/MIL/BLD[CR]become[CR]increasingly outclassed as the game progresses.[CR]- It becomes[CR]difficult to build facilities later on, because usually they take[CR]two or[CR]three turns to build, two turns to destroy, and your opponent moves[CR]first.[CR]In later expansions, they fixed this by making Facilities much harder[CR]to[CR]scrap, but youre stuck with the game the way it is.[CR]- 1 VP ATT missions[CR]suffer in a similar way; the head start your opponent gets[CR]matters a lot[CR]thanks to the low clear condition. Additionally, once you begin[CR]needing 4-5[CR]VP, stationing characters can be a severe disadvantage. Someone[CR]with 2 1 VP[CR]missions and 2 Facilities cleared has four characters tied up for[CR]3 VP.[CR]Playing and winning Take LRenouille gets you 3 VP for only[CR]one[CR]character.[CR]- In the main story, youre going to be seeing a lot of[CR]MIL missions. So even[CR]if youre playing an ATT or facility focused deck, you[CR]need a reliable way of[CR]dealing with these, because... [CR]- Unfortunately,[CR]Highland cards are some of the best in the game, and you spend[CR]most of the[CR]storyline fighting the Highland Army. Solon Ghee, Han, Culgan,[CR]Seed, and[CR]Luca are all extremely difficult to deal with. Even though Rina[CR]offers 0[CR]MIL in a military mission, getting rid of one of those five is[CR]still[CR]usually a good play. Shus healthy MIL and ability to return a card to[CR]hand are[CR]extremely powerful.[CR]- Matches where you have to earn an[CR]overwhelming number of VP (more than 5) can[CR]be very difficult to win[CR]without running out of cards. Instead of trying to[CR]earn VP, you may want to[CR]add a few cards like Barbara or Warehouse to your deck[CR]and play a careful[CR]defense, trying to run your opponents deck down first so[CR]they lose. Playing[CR]decoy Facilities that take your opponent two or three cards[CR]to destroy can[CR]help, since they dont grant any VP.[CR]f) Critical Choices[CR]These are the[CR]"correct" choices, in order. You need to get maybe 80% right in[CR]order to[CR]access all endings.[CR]"Lets go home."[CR]"No way!" (twice, but not three[CR]times)[CR]"Come with me."[CR]"I wanna go home."[CR]"Hes here."[CR]"If I can[CR]help..."[CR]"If I have power..."[CR]"Its not your fault."[CR]"Im[CR]fine."[CR]"Let her go."[CR]"I cant run away."[CR]"And Jowy?"[CR]"We beat[CR]them?"[CR]"Sure."[CR]"Unforgivable!"[CR]"I dont think so."[CR]"I[CR]understand."[CR]"He did."[CR]"Step aside."[CR]"..."[CR]"Find Jowy!"[CR]"But, I[CR]cant."[CR]"Lets go."[CR]"But... I...!</plot>

    <plot>Hajime no Ippo: The Fighting is an action fighting game for the Game Boy[CR]Advance.[CR]Read Me:[CR] [CR] Hajime no Ippo[CR] English Translation[CR]Patch[CR] v1.0[CR] By Markliujy[CR]Intro[CR]----------------------------------------------------------------[CR]This[CR]is an English patch for the GBA game "Hajime no Ippo",[CR]a boxing game that[CR]is apparently like Punch Out, but with[CR]Hajime no Ippo characters.[CR] The[CR]Patch[CR]----------------------------------------------------------------[CR]The[CR]Patch is in IPS format and can be applied using any[CR]program that supports[CR]the format. If you dont know of one,[CR]try googling LunarIPS.[CR]The Patch is[CR]made to be applied to the version of the ROM[CR]found on the internet,[CR]namely:[CR]CRC32: 0x6EB8B128[CR]Size: 8.00 MB (8,388,608 bytes)[CR]Contains an[CR]Eurasia Intro[CR]The Patch will translate the entire game into English,[CR]and[CR]will also remove the Eurasia Intro.[CR]It has not been tested on any[CR]other versions.[CR] Translation[CR]Notes[CR]----------------------------------------------------------------[CR]1)[CR]Move Names:[CR] - I used "Long Upper", and it seemed to fit, but Im not[CR]certain about it.[CR] - "Get Up" means that literally, you get up. I[CR]couldnt[CR] think of any fancy way of saying it that was under the[CR] letter[CR]limit.[CR] - "Automatic Evade" means that literally to, you[CR] automatically[CR]evade. Its technically the "SP-DEF", or[CR] Special Defence that shows up on[CR]the screen when youre[CR] actually boxing. Again, I couldnt think of any cool[CR]way[CR] of phrasing it.[CR] - "Damage Avoid" is Dates special head turning[CR]move, the[CR] only special Special Defence. Again, I had no cool ideas.[CR] -[CR]"Down Avoid" is Down Avoid. You avoid going down. Since[CR] it was "D-Avoid",[CR]I figured itd be better off that way.[CR] - "Is that all you got?" is Shigetas[CR]trademark taunt from[CR] the manga and anime, if you dont know the manga and[CR]anime,[CR] its a taunt, which is what its under in the Move lists due[CR] to[CR]laziness.[CR]2) Move Lists:[CR] - There was a line of Japanese in the move[CR]lists that I[CR] removed, since I had no idea what it meant, except that[CR]it[CR] mentioned "button". Probably just telling you that you hit[CR] the[CR]buttons. Im guessing no one needs to know that[CR] hopefully.[CR] - For the[CR]Counter moves, "When Attacked" doesnt actually[CR] literally mean when[CR]attacked, as Im sure youll figure out.[CR]3) Misc:[CR] - The title screen is[CR]left in Japanese due to it looking[CR] better that way, and laziness.[CR] - In[CR]case the font looks familiar, I used Arial a lot (Lazy).[CR] Other[CR]Notes[CR]----------------------------------------------------------------[CR]This[CR]is my first attempt at Romhacking, but the game[CR]"should" be completely[CR]translated, apart from the sound[CR]and have no problems.[CR]However, there[CR]wasnt exactly any play testing, except[CR]myself playing through it once or[CR]twice. So, if anything is[CR]omitted or incorrect, please contact me. Any[CR]technical[CR]hiccup reports would be nice too.[CR] Contact[CR]Details[CR]----------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Email[CR]me at: Markliujy@gmail.com[CR]Or PM Markliujy at Romhacking.net[CR]Credits[CR]----------------------------------------------------------------[CR]BRPXQZME[CR]for translating most of the Win quotes.[CR]The Romhacking.net Community for[CR]their help translating and[CR]technical tips.[CR]ESP Software and Treasure for[CR]developing the game.[CR] Rant (Or[CR]History)[CR]----------------------------------------------------------------[CR]- This is my first actual complete romhacking project.[CR] - I started it back[CR]in April or so of 2008, thinking it[CR]would be a nice game to try and finish[CR]up since I *thought*[CR]it was all entirely composed of uncompressed graphics.[CR]I was[CR]wrong.[CR] - The game contained LZ compressed data and I was lost[CR]for[CR]a bit, but eventually wrote up decompressors and the like,[CR]in PHP.[CR]That was quite entertaining.[CR] - After a whole bunch of stumbling around and[CR]false starts,[CR]I eventually got somewhere after a month or so of on and[CR]off[CR]hacking.[CR] - Then I got lazy. Lack of translations and lots of[CR]manual[CR]labour is sure a killer...[CR] - Eventually I got back to it and[CR]finished up, except for[CR]the Win Quotes, because well, they dont run well[CR]through an[CR]online translator.[CR] - Thanks to BRPXQZME of Romhacking.net I[CR]got the rest of[CR]the Win Quotes translated, and here I am.</plot>

    <plot>Have you ever wanted to watch the entire Love Hina anime series, only to play[CR]it as a GAME?

While[CR]playing the game, if you are familiar[CR]with the Japanese version, you will[CR]probably notice that the text in this[CR]patch differs greatly from the[CR]original in several places.

This is because:[CR]1) There are space limitations[CR]we cant get around[CR]2) Some things just cant be translated (Kansaiben[CR]dialect, Sus wordplays)[CR]3) Some things didnt really make sense in the[CR]original[CR]4) The translator is incompetent[CR] There are quite a few[CR]Japanese words left in the game as well. This is[CR]because we like them[CR]better this way. If you are a Love Hina fan, this[CR]shouldnt be a problem.[CR]Quick reference for the illiterate:[CR]Kanrinin - resident manager[CR]Onsen -[CR]hot springs[CR]Ronin - retake student[CR]Itadakimasu - its what you say before[CR]eating[CR]Instructions[CR]------------[CR]1) Just apply the IPS[CR]patch.[CR]Instructions for Dummies[CR]------------------------[CR]1) Buy the[CR]Love Hina Advance cart. It should be available at most places[CR] that sell[CR]imports. On the web, places like lik-sang.com and ncsx.com are[CR] good bets.[CR](Pity tronixweb.com doesnt seem to have it, theyre great.)[CR]2) Get yourself[CR]a cart copier so you can dump your cart onto your hard[CR] drive. If you cant[CR]access one, find an image of the ROM somewhere.[CR] Remember, do NOT download[CR]any ROM images you will find unless you own[CR] the original cart! Downloading[CR]a ROM for a game you do not own is ILLEGAL![CR]3) Once you have a working[CR]Japanese version of Love Hina Advance ROM on your[CR] computer, get an IPS[CR]patcher tool.[CR] http://www.zophar.net/utilities/genutil.html for[CR]example...[CR]4) Use the IPS patcher program to apply the IPS patchfile to the[CR]ROMfile.[CR]5) Now copy the modified file back to a cart and start[CR]playing![CR]Contacting us[CR]-------------[CR] You would want to contact us?[CR]Why? Well, if you really have a good reason[CR]to. But first, before writing[CR]to us, read these rules:[CR]The DOs[CR]+ Letters of thanks are welcome, they[CR]will help boost our egos[CR]+ Do write bug reports if you find any[CR]+[CR]REASONABLE suggestions are fine[CR]The DONTs[CR]- Do NOT ask us to send you an[CR]image of the ROM or ask for help in finding it![CR] You would be asking us to[CR]do something illegal. Not only will we not[CR] help you, but we will also add[CR]your name and e-mail address to a list[CR] of idiots in following versions. We[CR]might also forward your contact[CR] information to Nintendo of America - they[CR]are always interested in[CR] finding people who try to pirate their[CR]property.[CR]- Do not ask when/if the next version is coming out[CR]- Do not[CR]ask us to translate something else - were probably not going to[CR] do any new[CR]projects.[CR]- Dont ask for us to help you on romhacking or translation - we[CR]suck at[CR] those. Youre better off asking someone else.[CR]- Dont ask to be[CR]part of this project. While we appreciate the offer, we[CR] dont really intend[CR]to take this much further.[CR]- Dont ask our help if you cant get this patch[CR]to work. Its not hard.[CR] Just try it yourself.[CR] If youve read all the[CR]above, and think that you could write to us, then[CR]do so. We cant guarantee[CR]a reply though. Weve set up an email for[CR]feedback, at[CR]lhaproject@uct2.net.[CR]Other stuff[CR]-----------[CR] Oh, right... we did all[CR]this:[CR] Chief Ug - translation, script romhacking, hogging all the credit to[CR]himself[CR] mandom - ASM romhacking, graphics dumping and editing[CR] Gangis -[CR]graphics[CR] Also thanks to X-Sykodad for being a persistent otaku and beta[CR]tester![CR]........................

The game featured several new Original mechas, alongside with old favorites and newcomers, such as Mazinger Z and Full Metal Panic!, respectively.[CR]At the start of the game, the player chooses three favorite series, which enables mechas of the chosen series to have additional upgrade slots, which are blue in color, compared to the standard black of normal slots. A players existing favorite series at the end of the game is retained in the New Game, and thus players can choose every mecha series available in the game as a favorite after several replays.</plot>
