		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Coming off the failure that was Tomorrow Never Dies, publisher EA wanted to return to James Bond's roots as a first-person shooter. The game, based on the film of the same name, had a different developer for each of the three platforms that it was released on. The Nintendo 64 version was developed by Eurocom, the PlayStation version was developed by Black Ops Entertainment, the developer of the previous James Bond game Tomorrow Never Dies, and by 2n Productions for the Game Boy Color. Versions of the game  for the PC and PlayStation 2 were planned for release but were later cancelled midway through the development cycle.[CR]The Nintendo 64 version of the game featured a multiplayer mode that was absent from the PlayStation version. The Nintendo 64 version also supported both Rumble Pak and Expansion Pack accessories. The game features 14 single player missions that follow the story of the film very closely. Just like GoldenEye 007, the game featured three difficulty levels: Agent, Secret Agent, and 00 Agent. Completing missions on a certain difficulty would allow you to unlock additional multiplayer maps such as a dark Eastern European forest, a version of MI6's Scotland Headquarters and ski resort complete with working gondolas, and an airplane. The PlayStation version is known for lacking three levels, a level of difficulty and multiplayer modes.[CR]The campaign contained multiple gadgets and numerous weapons the player could use. Each weapon had a second setting on it, such as the SA90, which could switch between single and burst modes of fire.[CR]The World is Not Enough contained a robust split-screen mode found in most James Bond games. Players could customize their experience in various ways. They could choose what weapons they wanted to be available ( sniper rifles, explosive weapons, close combat etc.), choose how they wanted their avatar to look while playing in the game, have either vertical or horizontal split-screen, and select score limit and match time. Players could fight in teams, Free-for-All, Last Man Standing, uplink, Capture the Flag and King of the Hill modes. During the game, players could pick up various gadgets and aids such as body armor and night vision goggles.[CR][B]Weapons:[/B][CR]Submachine GunsP90Ingalls Type 90Meyer TMPExplosive WeaponsGL40 Grenade LauncherSentinel Heat-Seeking Missile Launcher - Can fire in single or fully automatic modes.Frag GrenadeSticky GrenadeHandgunsRaptor Magnum - Includes optional laser sight.James Bond's classic Wolfer P2KAssault RiflesAK-47M4 Mustang - A variant of the M16.Meyer BullpupSniper RiflesSA90[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Cheat Codes[CR]Pause game and press Up, Right, Left.

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]1942 was originally released for  arcades in 1984. While the game was ported to several other platforms including the  MSX and  ZX Spectrum, the most popular version would belong on the  NES in 1986 developed by  Micronics.[CR]1942 would go on to become Capcom's first franchise, releasing sequels, spin-offs, and even a prequel. 1942 has solidified itself in gaming history, released in several Capcom "greatest hits" collections including Capcom Generations, Capcom Classics Collection, and Capcom Classics Collection: Reloaded.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Players pilot Super Ace, a Lockheed P-38 Lightning, while shooting their way through the Pacific Theater. Not just for kicks, of course. The primary objective in 1942 is to reach  Tokyo in order to destroy  Japan's remaining air force. The game featured an  evade maneuver, allowing the plane to roll out of the way of incoming fire. There was also a two-player mode, but the series didn't start out with cooperative play. Instead, players would trade off and achieve their own designated scores.[CR]While traversing the Pacific Theater, Super Ace would fly through eight locations split between thirty-two stages, four stages in each. All of the stages are set in true-to-life locations including Midway, Marshall, Attu, Rabaul, Levte, Saiban,  Iwo Jima, and  Okinawa.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Stage Passwords[CR]Input password for desired stage[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Secret Level[CR]Unlock Tok Land</plot>

The player takes control of Action Man as they travel through seven different levels ranging for jungles to the Arctic, battling an army of robots with a variety of weapons and battle suits in search of Base X and stop Dr. X from launching a terrifying new weapon that could very well bring an end to the world.[CR]The gameplay is a standard side-scrolling action platformer where the player advances throughout the level, destroying enemies and avoiding pit falls.  Along the way they can pick up more powerful guns as well as a bow and arrow and even different suits that can help them on their quest.

		<title_clean>Aladdin</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR] The lamp level [CR]There were three different video game versions of Disney's Aladdin, two released within weeks of one another. One was developed and published by Virgin Interactive and the other by Capcom. It is the Capcom version that made an appearance on the SNES - and much later the Game Boy Advance - while the Virgin Interactive game was released initially for the Sega Genesis and later ported to the NES, Game Boy, Game Boy Color and DOS and Amiga home computers. It is also of note that alongside the official NES game, there were two unofficial ports of the same game and another illegitimate one of Capcom's version.[CR]In both games, the player must guide Aladdin through several locations seen in the 1992 movie of the same name. In the Virgin Interactive game, Aladdin has a sword which he can use to attack enemies, however in the Capcom version the only weapons are apples scattered around the levels which are used temporarily stun guards, who can only be killed if Aladdin jumps on their head.[CR]The third game was made by Sega for the Game Gear and Master System. It follows the plot of the movie more closely than the other two games, and instead of being a straightforward platformer, it plays more like Prince of Persia; most levels have Aladdin solving minor puzzles to progress, rather than defeating enemies and navigating platforms (However, other levels do take place in a running perspective, requiring traditional platformer skills).[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The plot in both titles is taken directly from the film so it may not be new to many players. The story is based on an Arab folktale by the same name from One Thousand and One Nights (Though many aspects have been changed by Disney). Players control a street urchin by the name of Aladdin who meets a young princess named Jasmine. The Grand Vizier Jafar wants Jasmine for his bride and needs Aladdin to get the magic lamp from the Cave of Wonders for him. Things don't work out the way they were supposed to and Aladdin gets stuck with the lamp, as well as three wishes. Then, more things go wrong and eventually a battle between Jafar and Aladdin occurs. Aladdin comes out victorious, frees the genie, and gets engaged to the princess.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the Genesis version of the game scores of 9,8,9 and 8 out of ten. Ed Semrad wrote, "What happened to the Genesis!?! Suddenly, all of the latest titles are some of the best ever seen! This cart has got to be seen to be believed! The animation is absolutely flawless, making it look just like the animated movie -- literally! The slapstick humor of the movie is also retained...".[CR]Danyon Carpenter wrote, "...Aladdin takes many ideas from side-scrollers and turns it into a slapstick game everyone can enjoy. The sound effects are right on the money and the animation has yet to be rivaled. No other game comes close when comparing animation...".[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level Skip[CR]During a level, pause the game and press:[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level Passwords[CR]Go to the password screen and enter the following:[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level Passwords[CR]The password has two parts. One part is for the level number, and the other part is for the number of lives. Two numbers/letters are used for each to make it harder for you to guess passwords. You can create passwords to start on any level except the first one, which doesn't use a password. To create a valid password, use the two lists below. Just put matching numbers/letters from the other list wherever you see question marks (?). [CR]Level.................. Password (Partial) [CR]Agrabah Market......... (no password) [CR]The Desert............. 1?0? [CR]Agrabah Rooftops....... 2?1? [CR]Sultan's Dungeon....... 3?2? [CR]Cave of Wonders........ 4?3? [CR]The Escape............. 5?4? [CR]Rug Ride............... 6?5? [CR]Sultan's Palace........ 7?6? [CR]Jafar's Palace......... 8?7? [CR]The End................ 9?8? [CR]Lives.............. Password (Partial) [CR]0.................. ?1?9 [CR]1.................. ?2?Z [CR]2.................. ?3?B [CR]3.................. ?4?C [CR]4.................. ?5?D [CR]5.................. ?6?S [CR]6.................. ?7?F [CR]7.................. ?8?0 [CR]8.................. ?9?1 [CR]9.................. ?Z?2 [CR]10................. ?B?3 [CR]11................. ?C?4 [CR]12................. ?D?5 [CR]13................. ?S?6 [CR]14................. ?F?7 [CR]255/Infinite....... ?0?8 [CR]Note: When using the 255/Infinite life code, the tens digit of the extra life counter may not display correctly. It changes after every 10 lives lost, but it may not be a recognizable number. This does not affect game play. [CR]There also seems to be a bug that allows certain invalid passwords to be accepted. This can cause the game to crash. Doing this intentionally is not recommended of course, and may void your warranty. However, if this does happen to you accidentally or someone else does it intentionally, you can try turning the game off and on again. No warranties. [CR]</plot>

		<title_clean>Alone in the Dark - The New Nightmare</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]New Nightmare is the fourth game in the Alone in the Dark series, though it has little connection to the original beyond the lead character of Edward Carnby and themes of supernatural monsters. Its setting was also updated to reflect a more modern period. Much of the gameplay design still remains in tact, however, with a mix of puzzle solving and combat performed within a series of fixed camera angles.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Each protagonist's gameplay differs in terms of the amount of action and puzzle related gameplay that the player will face with Carnby being the more action-orientated portion of the game and Aline's being more puzzle-orientated. Though the player can chose between either protagonist the stories of each of the characters both occur at the same time and interwoven together. Though there is no major difference in terms of how each character is controlled.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Main CharactersEdward CarnbyCarnby.[CR]A thirty-three year old private eye, Edward Carnby travelled to Shadow Island to discover what exactly happened to his best friend, Charles Fiske, when Fiske was found dead on Shadow Island. As Carnby becomes more involved with the events taking place on Shadow Island, he becomes less interested in his initial goals and concentrates on finding a way off the island and to ensure Aline's safety.Aline CedracAline.[CR]A 27 year old Ethnology Professor at Boston University, Aline Cedrac travelled to Shadow Island to help Professor Obed Morton decipher Abkannis writing tablets as well as to search for the identity of her father.Edenshaw[CR]The last Abkannis witchdoctor, Edenshaw came to Shadow Island many years ago and has lived with the Morton family ever since. Edenshaw has watched over the Morton family for many years and has made it his mission to ensure that the gate to the World of Darkness is never opened. Edenshaw acts as an assistant to the player and will appear every now and again to reveal information that may or may not be necessary to the player. He plays a major role towards the end of the game.Edward Morton[CR]Initially Edward assisted his brother in attempting to open the gate to the World of Darkness and made deals with Christopher Lamb in order to gain 'supplies' that he required in order to make further progress. Edward was revered by many for his work on the Abkannis tribe, though they were unaware of his methods of discovery. After a period of time, Edward realised just how terrible the things he was doing were and turned against his brother, Adam, refusing to assist him.Plot[CR]Charles Fiske, Edward Carnby's partner and best friend has been reported dead off the coast of Shadow Island. Carnby decides to investigate his best friend's death which leads him to meet with Frederick Johnson, Johnson informs Carnby of three ancient stone tablets that Fiske was searching for. The tablets are believed to unlock some form of incredibly dangerous power.[CR]Johnson requests that Carnby should take up Fiske's investigation and to search for the tablets. Carnby accepts that it is his personal priority however, is to find whoever killed Fiske. Johnson introduces Carnby to Aline Cedrac, a young and intelligent university professor. Aline accompanies Carnby to Shadow Island to help recover the tablets as well as to assist Professor Obed Morton, who she believes is her long-lost father. As their plane nears the coast of Shadow Island, it comes under attack by a creature of the island, which forces them to parachute out of the plane. They are separated, Aline landing atop the roof of a mansion and Carnby landing in some woods nearby.[CR]Ports[CR]Game Boy Color[CR]Alone In The Dark: The New Nightmare was ported to the Game Boy Color by Pocket Studios and was first released in Europe alongside its console counterparts on May 18, 2001. The port was later released in America on June 25, 2001.[CR]When Alone In The Dark: The New Nightmare was ported to the Game Boy Color the handheld could not handle the 3D environments of the game, so the 3D was abandoned in favor of 2D sprites. The Game Boy Color received a relatively faithful port of the home console game. While the home console versions could be completed in six to eight hours, the Game Boy Color port could be completed in just one.[CR]Film[CR]In 2005, a film adaptation directed by the infamous Uwe Boll was released based on the video game series. The movie was supposed to be a direct sequel to the fourth game in the series, Alone in the Dark: The New Nightmare, although the movie has little-to-no relation to the original trilogy of games from the 1990s. The movie contains plot elements that directly contradict those in The New Nightmare, thus it is not considered canonical. The movie was named the "Lowest-Grossing Game Based Movie" in the Guinness World Records: Gamer's Edition 2008 edition.[CR]System Requirements (PC)[CR]MinimumOS : Windows XP / Vista / 7Processor : 1.4 GHz processorMemory : 256 MB RAM ( 512 MB RAM recommended)Graphics : 3D graphics card compatible with DirectX 9.0c, 256 MB VRAMHard Drive : 1.5 GB available space[CR]Availability[CR]AitD: The New Nightmare can be purchased at GOG, Steam, GamersGate, and Humble Bundle.[CR]External Links[CR]Spiral House[CR]</plot>

		<plot>A monster-collecting RPG set in the Puyo Puyo game world and starring the young apprentice magician Arle, who must explore the land in order to collect a series of magical gems and defeat the evil Satan, who plots to take over the world yet again.[CR]The game is played from a top-down perspective in which you control Arle as she explores towns and dungeons, chatting with NPCs, finding or buying items, etc. Combat whisks your character to a side view from which you select your actions in standard turn-based fashion and fight it out against the many monsters and opposing characters that you can run into. Whenever you defeat a monster, you gain their unique card which can be tapped to summon said monster to join you in your quest. You can have up to two monsters fighting by your side at any time, and they level up and gain experience just like you do.</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]Armorines: Project S.W.A.R.M. is based on the Armorines comic book, where armored marines fight aliens in the name of the United States government. You do much of the same in the game, but the enemies strike little resemblance to those in the comic. The Spider Aliens of the comic book are slightly humanoid, while those found in the game resemble over-sized bugs. You must save Earth from invading enemies, much like in the movie Starship Troopers released a couple of years earlier.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Screenshot[CR]It's a first-person shooter where each mission is objective-based. There are five environments, both on Earth and in space. Several game segments are on-rails. Player are ranked in a points system and promoted when due. There are two Armorines available for play, one slow and strong and one fast and adequate in strength. Two-player co-op and standard four-player Deathmatch are supported.[CR]The game uses Acclaim's Turok 2 engine. By using a Nintendo 64 Expansion Pak, the Nintendo 64 version can output in hi-res (640 x 480). The game had no analog support on the PlayStation version, making the control schemes difficult to use.[CR]On the GameBoy Color version, you play as a single marine with five weapons to choose from. There are six levels and seven kinds of enemies.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Gunnery Sergent Harold "Gunny" Lewis[CR]Lieutenant Myra Lane[CR][B]Reception:[/B][CR]Although sharing the same engine as the successful Turok 2: Seeds of Evil, the game did not fare well among videogame critics. IGN wrote that "Armorines is a Starship Troopers add-on to the Turok 2 engine. Nothing more." The GameBoy Color version generally received higher scores than the console versions. The Nintendo 64 version generally received higher scores than the PlayStation version; GameSpot wrote that discussing all the bad things about the PlayStation version "would be like flogging a dead horse" and that "elements that were bland and boring in the Nintendo 64 version are downright offensive here."[CR]A sequel for the game was planned, but then cancelled after the game's poor reception.[CR]Prequel Comic[CR]A four issue mini-series was released by Acclaim Comics prior to the games release. Due to low sales, these issues are hard to find, particualarly the final issue (featuring the X-O Manowar).[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Cheat Mode[CR]From the start screen, go to Password and type in the password:[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Cheat Mode[CR]Select "Password" from the main menu then enter the code below.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Sound Test[CR]At the very end of the game when it says The End or is it... press in any direction on the d-pad to go through the music of the game.

		<title_clean>Asterix &amp; Obelix</title_clean>
		<plot>Being the predecessor of Asterix and Obelix for SNES, this game features the same story as it's later counterpart - however the level design was massively changed, doesn't offer a 2 player mode and level codes were added only for the GameBoy Color version.[CR]To show Caesar the power and freedom of your village, you have to collect various trophies from all over Europe. To do this, you can select Asterix or Obelix and move them through various levels while beating up Roman soldiers, collecting coins and avoiding gaps or other obstacles. Various special levels like crossing the sea to Great Britain by boat (and beating up some Romans again) or freeing Rugby players captured by the Romans are scattered across the game and provide variety between the classical Jump 'n Run levels. Most levels additionally have a time limit to make things a bit harder, though the difficulty of the game can be adjusted.[CR]There's an overall of four different countries, all of them based on comic books of the series (namely: Asterix in Britain, Asterix in Switzerland, Asterix at the Olympic Games, Asterix in Spain). At the end of each of these stages you have to contend in a contest typical for the country and also taken from the plot of the comics: In Britannia you take part in a rugby match, in Switzerland you have to blast safes, in Greece you take part in the Olympic games and in Spain you have to fight against (or run from) a bull - victory will get you the desired trophy!</plot>

		<title_clean>Asterix - Search for Dogmatix</title_clean>
		<plot>Asterix and Obelix (based on the French comic book series), must embark on a journey from the forests of France to the coliseums of Rome. Their goal is to find Obelix's lovable pet dog, Dogmatix. Players take control of Asterix or Obelix, and run, jump and punch through various well-drawn and colorful levels in this side-scrolling adventure game.[CR]This title is somewhat non-linear, and allows players to choose the order in which to visit stages, as well as the numerous mini-games. The stage-select screen is a mini-map, and after selecting to play either Asterix or Obelix, players can visit the boss arena, the inn (extra energy, hints and passwords are found here), as well as the the local mini-game. These mini-games become available from the title-screen under the "Instant Fun" option. They vary from a "Memory" style shield-matching game to humorous events such as "Throw a Roman Mini Game".[CR]Both Asterix and Obelix play differently as they have individual abilities and limitations. Asterix is more nimble, can run faster and jump higher, whereas Obelix is more powerful (being able to bash through some walls) but noticeably slower. These differences are highlighted by the obstacles presented in the stages - there are many jumps to make as well as many enemies (Roman soldiers, boars, centurions) to dispose of. In the quest to find Dogmatix, it is vital to collect keys hidden within the levels to make available new areas. Similarly, it is also important to collect coins from beaten enemies as they allow the purchases at each inn, (which is aptly manned by Getafix himself!).</plot>

		<plot>Unlike Activision's earlier remake of an Atari arcade classic, Battlezone, this one stays close to its namesake.  Take the original, Atari coin-op game Asteroids, add in the features of the Atari 2600 cartridge, then give it 3-D graphics and a bunch of power-ups, and you've got Activision's Asteroids remake.[CR]You are an employee of the Astro-Mining Corporation.  Your mission is to simply go to an assigned area of space and clear the area of asteroids and the occassional debris.  The game consists of five zones, each with a different background and some with special features.  Each zone has 15 levels.  In addition to the standard asteroids, there are also mined asteroids that explode; indestructible asteroids that are, well, indestructible; fireball comets; crystal asteroids that regenerate; alien egg asteroids containing deadly baby space worms; and ancient energy asteroids that shoot back!  And there's plenty of enemies in addition to the asteroids, such as Standard and Super Saucers, Asteroids Tugs, Fuel Transports, Hexes, Nuke Drivers, and Vulturoids.[CR]There are three types of ships to choose from, each with different strengths and weaknesses.  There are also three skill levels.  If you beat the game at Expert or higher, you gain access to a fourth type of ship.  All ships features the standard laser, shield, flip (instantly flips your ship 180 degrees), and hyperspace.  There are also limited power-ups you can  pick up such as GunSat, Mines, Homing Missiles, Plasma Drill, and Trigger Bombs.[CR]The game supports either one or two players.  In two player mode, the object is to simply outscore your opponent in a random zone and level.  You cannot directly kill your opponent by shooting him, but there are other ways....[CR]Lastly, if you shoot the classic-style asteroid in level 15 of the first zone, you'll find the option of "Classic Asteroids" now appearing on the main menu.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Classic[CR]To unlock classic mode shoot 2 of the white, 2D astriods and go to the main menu. Must do this every time you turn game off.</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Austin Powers: Oh Behave! appeals to hardcore Austin Powers fans who are rather unorganized. The game comes complete with a mini word processor (shown as Austin's Pad), a calculator (known as the Shagulator), and an imitation web browser that lets you browse facts about the Austin Powers movies. With these things, the game also lets you customize the background, screen saver, sound effects and wallpaper among other things. Not only does the game help fans organize, but it also includes various games inspired by the movie.International Man in a Platform Game[CR]This is the largest of the games where you play as Austin in a side-scrolling adventure inspired by the movie. It involves you climbing obstacles and dispatching foes as you try to find your way to the end of each level.Mojo Maze[CR]Mojo Maze is a spin-off of Pac-Man.Domination[CR]Domination is a board game that is similar to Othello (aka Reversi) in which the player flips chips over their opponent's to change color. Whoever has the most chips of their color on the board by the end of the game wins.Rock, Paper, Scissors[CR]Oh Behave! puts a new twist on this classic game as it puts you up against an Austin Powers villain from the movies. You are able to select which villain to face along with the difficulty setting. A stoplight appears and you must cycle between rock, paper, or scissors and "throw" your choice when the light turns green. If you enter your choice too soon or too late you automatically lose, the window of time depends on the difficulty you have selected. The game keeps track of your wins and losses over time.Multiplayer[CR]Austin Powers: Oh Behave! supports system link to play a few of the games with friends.[CR]Turning off the Game[CR]The game requires you go to the ROM menu and select the power down option. A message appears informing you when it is safe to turn off your system. Failure to do so means the next time the game is started errors will be found, luckily the game will automatically repair any errors found on startup.

		<title_clean>Azure Dreams</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The Monster Tower has stood at the edge of Monsbaya for generations. Hunters come from far and wide to search their fortunes in its shifting floors, but few climb higher than just a few floors, and none has ever seen the top. Koh's father was the greatest hunter the land had seen, but he mysteriously disappeared in the tower when Koh was just a child. Now Koh is 16, an adult and old enough to be allowed into the tower. He journeys into the tower to searche for clues as to the fate of his father, the mystery of the tower, and for untold riches.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Azure Dreams has a core gameplay (dungeon explorer) and a few other gameplay elements that revolve around the main one (monster tamer, dating sim, and city sim).Dungeon Explorer (Roguelike)[CR]Azure Dreams is first and foremost a dungeon explorer, more resembling a roguelike. While inside of the main dungeon, Koh takes turns in everything he does: walking, attacking, using an item and activating a trap takes one turn. All of the monsters on the same floor also take a turn. The dungeon floor is randomly generated, along with the items, monsters and traps. When exploring the dungeon, the character can only bring in 5 items, but can take out up to 20 items. When the character enters the dungeon, he starts at the first floor, at level one. The only things that don't reset are the items (swords, magic orbs and shields) and the level of monster allies (see: monster tamer). To exit the tower the player needs to find either a wind crystal item, or die, but death destroys all held items. At Koh's house, there is a bank that can hold 40 items and a monster hut that houses monsters.Monster Tamer[CR]This element greatly influences how far the player can get into the dungeon, and a few other things. The only way to get a monster (besides the starting one) is to hatch the eggs found in the dungeon. Eggs can be hatched inside the tower, but they will be lost when exiting. The better idea is to bring it back home and decide what to do from there. They can either be stored and leveled up, or sold for a high price. All of the monsters have a type and a spell associated with it and base stats. The big thing is that their level doesn't reset when Koh leaves the dungeon, so the player's pets will be the big factor on how far they get into the dungeon. Later on in the game, Koh finds a second collar to control the monsters, letting him command two monsters. At this point monsters can also be fused together, merging their stats and giving them access to spells they otherwise couldn't access. The monsters also have an AI that can be set to make them aggressive, use their abilities more or less often, and even change the position they take around Koh.Dating Sim[CR]Although there is lots to do in the dungeon, there is just as much to do out in the town of Monsbaiya. There are 8 ladies that have their own little story arc, and Koh can "befriend" all of them. Using the money made in the dungeon, the player can buy the girls presents like flowers or octopus balls to win them over. Some girls will only appear in the town when a particular building is built. Aside from looking at very well drawn static anime pictures of the ladies, there is not much else beneficial effect from the girls. It is possible to "romance" multiple girls and this results in more than one girl attending to the hero as he wakes up at home, fighting each other for his affection. Returning the Water Medal to the pool allows the player to see the romanced girls in their swimsuits.[CR]In the original Japanese release it was possible to marry a girl upon completing her storyline, but this was removed from the western releases. Probably because Koh is 16 years old while his girlfriends range in age from 13 to 18 years in age.City Sim[CR]The other big thing the player can do outside of the dungeon is interact with the town itself. There are a few ways to do this. They can buy new things for Koh's house, like rugs, lamps, a TV, refrigerators, tables, chairs, and even a blue motorcycle! The home can also be upgraded, making it more fancy (and getting a bigger bathtub in the process) and the monster hut can be expanded to hold more monsters. The player can also improve the town with new buildings, and there are two ways to get them. The really special ones require items from the dungeon (like the water medal for the pool) and the player has to go through a bit of story concerning the item and place. The other way is with cold, hard cash. The player talks to the builder, and he will build new locations, most of which have mini-game associated with it like the bowling alley and the casino.[CR]Game Boy Color[CR]The later Game Boy Color release of Azure Dreams is fairly similar, but with several significant changes. Romancing ladies has been removed entirely, and most of the town building has been removed as well. The player can still upgrade their house, and donate money to Nico to improve the town's overall look, but there are no individual buildings nor home furnishings that can be purchased. Instead of every floor in the dungeon being randomly generated the game instead picks from a pool of pre-made level designs, so in general the tower floors are more symmetrical and intentionally constructed. Facing directions has been reduced from 8 to just four as well.[CR]To make up for those cuts Azure Dreams GB features double the number of obtainable monsters, including all the monsters from the PlayStation version which could only be encountered in minigames, like the ball and pin monsters from the bowling alley. The new monsters are designed on classic mythological designs, like dragons, Medusa and Odin. Their design is more typical of other JRPGs, and they clash with the cartoony designs of the original game. There are far more events inside the tower in the GBC version, including meetings with several other Hunters who were not in the original game. The tower also has a basement that is accessible after completing the game's story mode which is just as deep as the tower is tall. As well the items that Koh must find in the tower for sidequests have also changed.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>Babe the Pig, of the eponymous movies, was raised by sheepdogs and, hence, believes himself to be a "sheep-pig", who herds sheep as his foster parents do.  In this game, you control the plucky little porker and direct his sheep management attempts, driving them forward toward the goal in exaggerated, frictionless Soko-Ban or Boulder Dash style with porcine barks until their movement is halted or altered should their course intercept an obstacle such as a fencepost, moveable haystack, pit or trampoline.[CR]Babe is given hints and tips in these efforts by lovable characters from both of his feature films, and the 40 levels borrow inspiration both from the calm pastoral setting of the first and the surreal urban folly of its sequel.  While the measured puzzles are a far cry from the excitement of the movies, the material finds a surprisingly good fit in this unexpected genre -- or otherwise put, "that'll do, pig."</plot>

		<title_clean>Ballistic</title_clean>
		<plot>Ballistic is a puzzle game in which the player must place 3 patterned balls next to each other in order to clear them. It is somewhat similar to Puyo Puyo in this respect. However Ballistic places the player in the center of the screen shooting the balls outward. In Panic! mode, a constant string of balls appear and the player must keep destroying similar balls to keep the string short and prevent it from snaking around and reaching the middle of the screen. In Checkmate mode, a limited amount of balls are given to the player which they must use to destroy all the balls on the screen. Strategy is used here since the amount of balls destroyed must be maximized.[CR]Ballistic also features a versus mode in which players can challenge one another. Similar to other puzzle games versus modes, one player's success results in additional balls on the other player's screen which they then must clear.</plot>

		<plot>Balloon Fight GB is a unique side-scrolling platform game. You control a little girl who's brother has floated away on a big bunch of balloons. It's up to you to chase after him through 8 treacherous levels. Instead of the usual jumping from platform to platform, you have a pair of balloons that allow you to float through the level. You must control your height carefully by tapping the 'A' button. Meanwhile, the screen is always scrolling to the left, and you have to keep up.[CR]In addition to the single player adventure, there is a 2-player mode that allows you to compete against a friend via the Game Boy link cable. In this mode you try to get your opponent to maneuver their balloon kid into the various level hazards.[CR]https://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy-color/balloon-kid[CR]</plot>

		<plot>Barbie Pet Rescue lets kids play with and care for a variety of domesticated animals. Visit Barbie and her kid sister Stacey at the Pet Rescue Center, where you'll wait for rescue missions, explore in the playrooms, or tend to pets in the Care Center.[CR]Rescue missions come in over the phone or via e-mail; after learning which pet is missing where, travel with Barbie on her scooter to one of three different environments in which to search for one of eight lost pets. In many missions, you'll have to figure out how to entice scared animals to come to you, or how to retrieve pets trapped in trees or other sticky situations. If you get stuck yourself, Barbie will give you hints. With each successful mission, you'll receive a printable Paw &amp; Purr Award that hangs on the Pet Rescue Center wall.[CR]Rescued pets come back to the Pet Rescue Center with you and Barbie to wait for their owners and receive a little TLC. Nurse them back to health in the Care Center, where you'll give recovered pets water, treats, vitamins and grooming. You may also need to bandage a hurt leg or pick burrs from ruffled fur. After creating a file for them in the computer and giving them a name you select from a list of suggestions, the animals go to one of two playrooms to wait for their owners.[CR]In the meantime, you can play with them, plus all the other pets already in the playroom--a kitten, bunny, hamster, puppy, and a turtle. Select which animal you'd like to pet, then use the cursor to stroke an animal's head or back or scratch it under the chin. The animals respond to your attention by licking, rolling over, purring, or barking.[CR]There is a related mini-game for each kind of animal--Kitten Keepaway, Puppy Treat Toss, Hamster Trail, etc.--and if you do well enough, you'll see the animal perform a special trick. A few of the games require the use of logic and spatial aptitude, but for the most part they challenge the players' mouse mastery and hand-eye coordination.</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker (known in Europe as Batman of the Future: Return of the Joker) (not to be confused with Batman: Return of the Joker) is a 3D side-scrolling beat-em-up developed by Kemco and published by Ubisoft for the Game Boy Color (on November 20, 2000), PlayStation, and Nintendo 64 (both on December 13, 2000). The video game tie-in to the animated movie of the same name, it puts players as the futuristic Batman (superhero alter-ego of high-school student Terry McGinnis), as he investigates Neo-Gotham City for the whereabouts of The Joker, a resurfaced villain from the days of the original Batman (superhero alter-ego of Terry's mentor, Bruce Wayne) who plans to use a satellite laser to destroy the city.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game plays like a traditional side-scrolling beat-em-up, as players play through five stages as Batman. Although the levels are side-scrolling, players can move anywhere around the level. Players can move him around with the analog stick, crouch with the Crouch button (C-Right on the N64), run with the Run button (L button on the N64), and jump with the Jump button (R button on the N64). He can attack using the Punch button (B button on the N64) and the Kick button (A button on the N64), and can block attacks using the Block button (Z button on the N64). Some of his abilities can be used with the Special button (C-Left on the N64).Bat Suits[CR]At any point in the game, players can switch between four different types of loadouts (called "bat suits") for Batman using the D-Pad, changing both his stats and his special abilities.[CR]Standard Suit - By wearing the Standard Suit, Batman can use his arsenal of gadgets (which can be used with the Special button and cycled through using the D-Pad): the Dark Knight Discus (thrown projectiles that require ammunition), the Dark Knight Staff (a staff swing which attacks in a circular area), and the Magnetic Nunchuku (a nunchuck attack which can be charged).[CR]Offensive Suit - More fragile than his other suits, the Offensive Suit is capable of stronger attack power and the ability to punch open certain crates. This suit allows him to perform a rolling kick (by pressing the Special button) and a low kick (by pressing the Crouch button when an enemy is close to him).[CR]Defensive Suit - Sacrificing his normal attacking power for better protection, the Defensive Suit gives him advanced shielding, allowing him to deflect most enemy attacks (using either the Special or Crouch buttons). He can also use his shielding to perform a damage-dealing Shield Punch by pressing the Special button while moving.[CR]Nimble Suit - While wearing the agility-oriented Nimble Suit and in the air, he can perform a double jump (by hitting the Jump button), a jump kick (by pressing the Kick button), or a glide (by holding down the Jump button).[CR]</plot>

		<title_clean>Black Onyx, The</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The Black Onyx is one of the first RPG hits to be released in Japan. It was created in 1984 by Henk B. Rogers and his Japanese team at Bullet-Proof Software. It was originally released on the NEC PC-8801, but soon it was released on other platforms as well, including the NES, where the game was called Super Black Onyx.[CR]The game sold over 150,000 copies in Japan, making it a major commercial success for a computer game of that era. In addition, it was voted Game of the Year by readers of Japan's Login magazine. As such, The Black Onyx was the most successful Japanese computer RPG when it released, sparking greater subsequent interest in the genre in Japan.[CR]Game Boy Color Version[CR]The Game Boy Color port was developed by Atelier Double and published by Taito. The Game Boy Color port added updated visuals from the original version. The Game Boy Color port featured the ability to play through the game with the original games visual style.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]The town of Utsuro has been engulfed by darkness, it is up to the players to form a party of brave heroes and travel deep underground to find the legendary Black Onyx. Retrieving this item will break that curs that has been put onto the town, and thus bringing light back into their life.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game takes place in the caves under Utsuro, where the player will the opportunity to create a party that can hold five party members. The caves that the game takes place in has several entrances, these entrances are hidden in location throughout the town. Once in the cave players will be faced with a six leveled dungeon (each has its own color), for the players to advance in the game each level need to be competed in a specific order. Once the correct order has been cleared the players will find the Onyx.[CR]There is no dept/distance measured in the game so you will only encounter melee combat in the game (A separate game called The Fire Crystal included the lacing magic system). Players will also have the opportunity to travel to the town where they can deposit their money so it won&#8217;t get stolen by thieves and they travel to the local hospital where the PC&#8217;s stats are shown.[CR]One mechanic that may have originated with this game, a health bar that slowly turned from blue to red in lieu of hit point numbers, has penetrated into other genres.[CR]Expansion/Extra Memory[CR]The game needed to be split into different games due to the memory limitations of the earlier systems. The following "expansions" were released:The Fire Crystal - Added a magic system to the gameThe Moonstone - Added a wilderness exploration feature to the gameArena - Added an Arena battle feature to the game.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>The second half of the Bomberman Max series, Red Challenger is much the same as Blue Champion in terms of the tasks at hand for the main character. However, instead of playing as Bomberman, you play as Max, who still is much the same as Bomberman except for looks. The graphics are also slightly different for each level compared to Blue.[CR]The task stays the same, plant bombs to destroy blocks and enemies in your way, as well as collecting Charabombs, creatures who act much the same as Pokmon where you raise the Charabombs and fight against other players. Certain Charabombs and levels are only available in Blue, so you must link with another Game Boy and the Blue Champion Edition to collect all of the Charabombs and complete the adventure.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Sound Test[CR]The following cheat works for 3 different Game Boy Color games: 1.

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Bomberman Quest is an RPG game developed by Hudson and published by Electro-Brain (US version), and Hudson (European and Japanese versions) for the Game Boy Color.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The Opening Cutscene[CR]Bomberman is piloting the Bomber Ship which is transporting the various enemies that Bomberman has defeated. These enemies are on their way to Planet Bomber to be imprisoned.[CR]The Bomber Ship is suddenly attacked by four mysterious lights. The lights then surround the ship and steal the four engines. While the attack is happening the imprisoned monsters are set free.[CR]Without the engines the Bomber Ship crashes to the surface on an unknown planet. All of the enemies who were released from their cells start attacking the residents on the unknown planet.[CR]Bomberman awakes from his crash and realizes that he needs to save the residents of this planet from these enemies and re-capture them.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]In Bomberman Quest there are two main play modes. The first mode is the story mode which is the main mode of the game that has players going through the games story in single player. The second mode is a two player battle mode which requires both players to have a Game Boy Color and a copy of the game.Story Mode[CR]The story mode in Bomberman Quest is played from a top down 2D perspective, similar to that of The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening.[CR]Players start the game outside of the crashed Bomber Ship and can then walk around the maps, talk to NPC characters, and attack the enemy monsters.AttackingBombing an Enemy Character[CR]The fighting in Bomberman Quest takes place in real time on the games maps. Players can equip various equipment that has been obtained in the menu. The equipment can be set to be used as the A button or the B button. The bombs are used very similar to a traditional Bomberman bomb. When placed the bomb will sit for a few seconds before exploding to the left, right, up, and down.[CR]Initially Bomberman can only place two active bombs at a time.[CR]</plot>

		<title_clean>Bug's Life, A</title_clean>
		<plot>A Bug's Life is a platform game with different goals in each of 15 levels. Most of the goals deal with getting the main character, Flik, to do events that match the storyline of the movie. When the player finishes a level, that player can proceed to the next level. Each new level starts with a new short animation from the movie. If the player collects all of the bonus items in a level, that player gets a bonus movie. Bonus items include 50 pieces of grain, four letters that spell F-L-I-K (like the Tarzan N64 game) and permanently finishing off each enemy bug. To guide the player through the levels there are little floating telescopes that will show the player areas where he is supposed to go. Throughout each level are a variety of types of seeds. Some seeds are partially buried in the ground. These seeds can be transformed by Flik into a specific kind of plant that can help him solve problems within the levels. Flik can increase the number of plants he can grow by collecting colored tokens scattered throughout the levels, with a token's color determining what type of plant can be grown with it. Some levels also included Flik&#8217;s harvesting invention (hidden somewhere in the level) which can be used to collect grain and kill off enemy bugs.</plot>

		<plot>When humankind discovers an alien race on a distant planet, it becomes clear that the extra-terrestrial way of life threatens survival on Earth. Rather than sending out a fleet of space destroyers or loads of nuclear warheads, it is determined that Earth's best chance of wiping out these creatures is (drum roll, please) you! As Space Marauder, it is your job to avoid waves of space beings careening through the outer reaches of the galaxy. You are aiding only by a jet pack and a laser gun. Sound tough? It is. Assorted power-ups are strewn about to help you in your plight, but the best asset you'll have is your itchy trigger finger and taste for alien blood. Lots of powerful bosses wait at the end of each of the game's levels, and every stage presents new and increasingly difficult challenges for our hero. Boasting a cool soundtrack and smooth controls, there's plenty of gameplay to keep your fingers moving for hours on end.</plot>

		<title_clean>Cannon Fodder</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Cannon Fodder, and its sequel Cannon Fodder 2, are top-down squad-based shooters. They both make use of reflex-based puzzle solving with some later levels requiring a high level of dexterity and good timing to complete. The games use a darkly-humorous anti-war theme, reflected in the theme song "War Has Never Been So Much Fun" (which had lyrics in the Amiga versions of the game) and in the pre-mission screen where a queue of recruits line up in front of a hill scattered with gravestones - one for each soldier lost during the course of the game. Each soldier is uniquely-named (some after the developers), standing in contrast to the "fodder" in the game's title.[CR]The player is able to split the initial squad of soldiers into smaller groups and switch between the groups. Squads are armed with guns (primary fire) and with a limited number of grenades and rockets to destroy enemy buildings and vehicles. Missions are usually along the lines of "Destroy Enemy Buildings" or "Kill All Enemies". Some missions take place over a number of phases and different locales such as Jungle, Snow and Desert areas.[CR]War Has Never Been So Much Fun[CR]...the game's tagline and opening lyric for the game's theme tune. Released amidst controversy over the use of the poppy graphic both on the box and on the title screen, the Royal British Legion claimed that the game could mistakenly be bought by its supporters after seeing the poppy symbol. Sensible Software included the message "This game is not in any way endorsed by the Royal British Legion" on the opening screen and the UK publishers, Virgin, removed the poppy from the box art.[CR]Original System Requirements[CR]PCCPU Type: 386SXRAM Required: 4 MBHard Disk Space: 7 MBOS Version: DOS 5.0Graphics Type: VGAColor Depth: 256 Colors[CR]</plot>

		<plot>In Centipede, the player is trapped in the Enchanted Forest. Armed with only a magic wand to ward off the forest's insect denizens, all of which apparently are attacking in the player in continuous waves. [CR]The player must use the magic wand to shoot sparks at approaching insects to score points by pressing the controller button. Holding down the controller button will set the wand to rapid fire shots. If the player is bitten by an insect, the player will be temporarily paralyzed and lose one of the three starting magic wands. [CR]Insect Opponents and Mushrooms[CR]All enemy insects have a distinctive sound before attacking, which may help the player identify which insect is attacking. Enemies and objects in the game are as the following:[CR]1. The Centipede[CR]The Centipede will attack in 12 waves. In the first wave, the Centipede will have a head attached to 11 body segments. In the second wave, the Centipede will have a head attached to 10 body segments, in addition to a detached head. The third wave will have the Centipede with an attached head, 9 body segments, plus two detached heads. These body segments will transform into heads and continue to do so until Wave 12. In the last wave, the Centipede will have 12 detached heads, independently attacking the player. Centipede heads are worth more points than body segments.[CR]Attacks from the Centipede will come from the top of the screen, moving downward. If a spark hits any part of the Centipede, that particular body segment will transform into a mushroom, while the body segment behind it will become the new Centipede head. When the Centipede is destroyed, it will briefly disappear and re-appear from the top of the screen again.[CR]The Spider[CR]The Spider will attempt to distract the player from attacking the Centipede. It will destroy any mushroom it touches. Spiders will score more points if it is hit in closer distances.[CR]The Flea[CR]The Flea will appear if the player has destroyed most of the existing mushrooms. It will drop down creating a new batch of mushrooms where it falls. The Flea will disappear after two hits.

		<plot>Chase H.Q. - Secret Police, is slightly different than the other Chase H.Q. games. You receive a call from Dispatch, telling you to arrest suspects that have just committed a felony. There are ten stages in the game, and each one of them has you placing three agents throughout the city. Each one of these agents have their own specialties. Once you have placed the agents, you must guide one of them toward the suspect vehicle. If the vehicle goes outside the city, the game is over.[CR]Once the two of you make contact, the battle begins where the object is to ram the suspect's vehicle until it is disabled. You can also shoot the vehicle to further damage it, and use up to three turbos to catch up with the vehicle if you happen to fall behind.</plot>

		<plot>Columns was to the Game Gear what Tetris was to the Game Boy. Some years after the Game Gear had ceased production, it was ported to the 'Boy. To spice things up, the game has been given several game modes, and, most notably, a licence to several popular manga characters created by Osamu Tezuka. Play as famous characters such as Astro Boy, Kimba or Black Jack.[CR]Apart from the main Columns mode, this edition features a puzzle mode like that of the Nazo Puyo games, where you must remove a set of pre-installed pieces using a set of pre-defined dropping pieces. There is also a link-up mode for battling with friends.[CR]The Tezuka characters play no big role in the game, being displayed in a window to the right of the playfield, changing mimics according to how the game progresses. You have six characters to choose from, and three save slots to put them in. The save slots let you keep your score for upcoming sessions.</plot>

		<title_clean>Conker's Pocket Tales</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Conker's Pocket Tales is a game developed and published by  Rare for the  Game Boy Color platform. Playing as the titular character  Conker the Squirrel - fresh off his debut in  Diddy Kong Racing - you must rescue your girlfriend  Berri from the villanous "Evil Acorn." Along the way, you must also retrieve your stolen birthday presents to advance to the next game areas, and participate in a variety of  minigames. These minigames include target galleries, slingshot shootouts, and even panning for gold. You must also solve a number of simple  crate puzzles - the first of which egregiously requiring you to push boxes out of the way in order to leave your own house.[CR]Conker's primary mode of attack is a slingshot, which fires acorns collected from around the map. The slingshot can be taken into a first-person mode in specific sections of the game, including several shooting gallery set-ups. In addition, Conker can also attack enemies with his tail before acquiring the slingshot (or if he should run out of acorns). Conker can also push certain objects around the screen,  ground stomp buttons lying on the ground, and dig into dirt patches which transport him to other parts of the map.[CR]The game was put out after multiple delays of  Conker's N64 game, while it was still intended to be aimed at a younger audience. As a result, Conker's character in Pocket Tales is a far cry from his console game counterpart, featuring little dialogue whatsoever by the character (none of it containing any obscenities).[CR]Backwards Compatibility[CR]Perhaps the game is most notable for it's ability to be played on the only-then-recently obsoleted  Game Boy; a feature shared by only a handful of other Game Boy Color games. Strangely, when loaded on the Game Boy, the changes extend beyond mere graphical downgrades. Many of the game's levels are re-designed in order to compensate for the monochromatic color scheme, with some minigames being re-tooled / omitted as well.[CR]In addition, should the player attempt to switch between playing on the Game Boy and the Game Boy Color, they must erase their save data in order to do so. Which is to say, the game cannot be played and saved on one system, and then resumed on the other.[CR][B]Reception:[/B][CR]The game received average scores upon it's release - including a 6.0 / 10.0 from IGN. In  their review, they compliment the game's variety of gameplay, but criticize it's simplicity. The graphics received high marks from many, both in-game and during the "pre-rendered" animated sequences, while the music and sound effects were determined by critics to be "lacking."[CR][B]Legacy:[/B][CR]The game's mark on history seems to be limited to being Conker's first game solo performance in a game, and it's backwards compatibility feature. Whether or not the game is canon within the Conker series is matter for fans to decide, as Bad Fur Day makes no specific mention of it. The only constants between Pocket Tales and Bad Fur Day are the characters Conker and Berri.[CR]The nefarious Evil Acorn has yet to make his return.[CR]</plot>

		<title_clean>Crystalis</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Crystalis is a top-down action RPG originally released for the NES in 1990. The game takes place in a world where a nuclear apocalypse took place in 1997. The survivors of the disaster built a powerful floating tower, with which to govern the world and prevent nuclear war from occurring again.[CR]100 years later, humanity has reverted to an age where the ways of science are forbidden and the people rely on magic. However, the power-hungry Emperor Draygon revives the ways of science in conjunction with magic and attempts to gain control of the floating tower and its advanced technology.[CR]The player character is a young man revived from sleep in a cryogenic stasis chamber. He is soon tasked with the quest to collect the four elemental swords so that the world can be saved. The main character is named by the player. If the game is started without giving him one, he will be assigned the name " SNK."[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Crystalis plays a lot like the top down games in the Zelda series, but has more RPG elements. As you defeat enemies, you gain experience points and money which can be used to buy new armor, shields, and various items. There are also spells which you can cast to heal damage, paralyze enemies, or shield yourself from attacks, which require Magic Points. The level cap is set at 16. Gaining levels is required to beat the game, as enemies who are too strong will take no damage at all from attacks until a certain level is reached.[CR]In combat, there is a meter at the bottom of the screen which represents your current sword's charge level. In addition to close range stab attacks, you can charge up the sword by holding down the attack button while standing still. Letting go of the attack button will release the charge, resulting in a ranged attack. You can also move around while still maintaining your current charge level. Each sword has three levels of charge available, but special items must be obtained and equipped to use the second and third levels, and the third level charge attacks require MP to use.[CR]There are four swords used during the main game, representing the elements of Wind, Fire, Water, and Thunder. Although the swords have different strengths from each other, (E.G. the Wind Sword obtained at the beginning has the lowest attack power of the four) some enemies and most bosses have elemental immunities, requiring a specific sword be used to defeat them.[CR]Game Boy Color Version[CR]Crystalis was later ported to the Game Boy Color ten years later by Nintendo. Changes were made to the overall story, as well as the soundtrack. Some gameplay aspects were also altered, such as how elemental swords were used. In the original NES version, monsters commonly have elemental immunities that prevent certain swords from damaging them at all. In the GBC release, this immunity was removed, greatly changing the strategic element of the game. In this version of the game, the main character's default name is "Simea".[CR]</plot>

Plus there are hidden characters to unlock, equipment upgrades and power-ups plus trick shots you just won't see on the PGA tour.[CR]https://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy-color/cyber-tiger-woods-golf[CR]</plot>

		<plot>As a furby you must dance! Woo-teh-loh-wah-boo! Shake it to the left, shake it to the right.[CR]A Furby is an owl-like monster with fluffy pink banana ears. They love to dance, sing, and slowly learn human speech. Specifically a Furby is an autonomous toy robot manufactured by Tiger Electronics, licensor of this game. These toys were among the first successful domestic robots. Here they will be dancing for you. [CR]Dancing Furby operates as a classic rhythm game, with a line of button prompts scrolling across the screen that you will have to press when they reach the current time mark, supposedly matched with the music.  A Furby on screen will dance in accordance with your performance, commenting on your timing in Furbish, "noo-loo" being perfect, "e-day" being acceptable, and "boo" is shrilled for failure. At the end of each song you'll have you score calculated in "noo-loo"'s etc. and then be allowed to continue.[CR]Successfully clearing a stage will result in you being able to 'connect' the Game Boy's infrared port with the matching port on the forehead of a Furby toy. This will impart information about the song to your furby teaching it to warble Fr Elise when you least expect it.[CR]You may also select a Furby to dance with in the game, be it spotted, striped, or lozenge-faced. Good performance will unlock more Furbies.[CR]Songs in the game include Twinkle Twinkle Little Star, Fr Elise, and a few 'popular' numbers.</plot>

		<title_clean>Dragon Quest I &amp; II</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Dragon Warrior I &amp; II is a compilation of two of the oldest NES Japanese role-playing games ever released. Its original release for the Super Famicom in Japan (in 1993) came with improved graphics and eventually a fan translation, and later for the Game Boy Color which was localized in English for its North American release in 2000. While an otherwise faithful recreation, both games received a significant graphical upgrade similar to the treatment given the Super Mario All-Stars compilation.[CR]Both of these classic Japanese RPGs played an important role back in the Famicom days in laying the foundation of the genre. Many of the genre staples like a turn-based battle system and experience points are part and parcel of both these games. Dragon Warrior I (originally released in 1986) tells a very simple tale of a warrior called Erdrick (though the player can rename them) who must save the world from the wrath of the evil Dragon Lord. Dragon Warrior II (released in 1987 in Japan) built upon its predecessor's strength by increasing the number of playable characters from one to three and adding a more intricate plot, set 100 years after the original.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Get Lucky in Dragon Warrior 1[CR]You know that girl that just follows you around in tantagel town? well get her to follow you then go to an inn and get a secret message from the innkeeper.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Rename Characters[CR]To rename the prince and princess save your game and rest.

After that, go to the Dragon's Horn North Tower, and get the Dew's Yarn on the 3rd floor.   Take these items and see Don Mahone.

It *WILL* be there.  After you get the Dew's Yarn the second time, *SAVE*.  After saving, turn the game off (make sure you hold in reset so you don't erase the files) and turn it back on.  Go back to Don Mahone and get your first Water Flying Cloth.  Now go back to Zahan and get the Magic Loom again.  Take the items to Don Mahone once again, and save.

This is unfortunate, as the sword and armour are the most powerful in the game.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] [CR]However, there is a way to gain the benefits of the items without the curse.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] [CR]1. Equip the item(s). This will give you the increased attack and/or defense of the cursed item(s) and inflict your character with the curse.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] [CR]2. Go to the House of Healing and pay to have the character equipping the item uncursed. This will cost 100 GP per experience level. This will remove the item(s) from your item list and remove the curse, but does NOT cause your attack or defense stat to recalculate.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] [CR]3. Never again look at your equip screen for that character or gain an experience level. The game does not recalculate the character's attack or defense stats until you look at the equip screen or gain a level, so you do not lose the hefty attack or defense bonus granted by equipping the cursed item(s).[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] [CR]You are free to look in and use other menus, including item and status, or even save and reset, without losing the bonus. However, since leveling up recalculates your attack and defense, you may want to wait until you are ready to defeat the final boss to use this glitch, since it cannot be repeated without finding a new copy of the cursed item.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] [CR]In the cave to Rhone, on level 5, fall down a hole (any hole).  Go to the lower left corner of level 4. Go one square up and one square right.  You'll fall down a hole, and the sword will be right there.  Best Sword in the game.</plot>

		<plot>[CR]Party and Class System[CR] Changing ClassesIn Dragon Warrior 3, the player controls a party of four. Dragon Warrior 3 was the first  Dragon Warrior game to implement a robust  class system, allowing the player to control both gender and class of the party members. The main character was a special "Hero" class, with both strong physical attacks and magic. In the original NES version, the initial classes to choose from are Soldier (high defence and attack), Fighter (fights unarmed and with claws), Wizard (attack magic), Pilgrim (healing and support magic), Merchant (finds extra money), and Goof-Off (high luck). Additionally, the Sage class is unlocked during the course of the adventure and other classes can transform into this advanced class. Later versions of the game on Super Famicon and the Game Boy Color added a Thief as an additional class as well as expanding the abilities of some of the original classes.  [CR] Battle System and Leveling Up [CR] Taking care of some SlimesDragon Warrior 3 has a traditional   turn-based battle system. Monsters are  encountered randomly on the  overworld maps and in dungeons. Defeating monsters yields gold and experience. As party members level up, attributes increase and new spells are automatically learned. Interestingly, the distribution of new attribute points and the exact level at which new spells are learned is somewhat random, and can flucuate in different playthroughs. Spells are cast using a traditional  MP-based system. Because the primary method of regaining MP is staying at inns, the player had to be carefull with MP management, so as not to run out in the middle of a dungeon. An interesting innovation of the game was battle arenas scattered in some towns throughout the world. In these arenas, the player could bet gold on the outcome of computer controlled battles between sets of monsters. Odds were given before the fight and betting on unlikely victors could mean big payoffs.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]Ortega vs. Dragon Dragon Warrior 3 takes place before the events of the first two games in the series. Additionally, the game begins in an entriely unique world, although the party will eventually travel to the original world, Alefgard, as well. At the start, the main character leaves his/her hometown of Aliahan, tasked with defeating the Arch-Fiend Baramos, who is out to destroy the world. The search for Baramos takes the party across the world. Upon defeating Baramos, the party is surprized to learn that their quest is not over. Zoma, who was Baramos' master, reveals himself and opens a portal to the dark world, which is Alefgard from  Dragon Warrior 1 and  2. In order to defeat Zoma, the hero must first collect a number of artifacts scattered throughout Alefgard. Interestingly, these artifacts were the same as those gathered in the original Dragon Warrior game. The party will also encounter Ortega, the Hero's father, during the course of the adventure. Ortega had travelled to Alefgard as well in an attempt to defeat Baramos, and dies shortly after you encounter him. Once the artifacts are gathered, a Rainbow Bridge appears, allowing the party to enter Zoma's castle and defeat the great evil.[CR]Innovations[CR] A Village at Night Dragon Warrior 3 represented a number of leaps forward for both the series and JRPGs in general. The  original Famicon version of Dragon Warrior 3 not only had  improved graphics over its predecesors, but also  an improved user interface, a larger and better developped game world, and a much more complex story line. The robust class system was also quite innovative for console RPGs at the time, and the ability to change classes part of the way through the quest added even more depth. Dragon Warrior 3 also debuted a unique  Day/Night system that has been an established feature of the series ever since. The Day/Night system allows time to pass while the party moves about on the overworld map. The effects of the system were more than just cosmetic as towns and castles could change remarkably during the night and some characters and quest objectives could only be encountered at a specific time of day. [CR]Connections to Dragon Warrior 1[CR]At the end of Dragon Warrior 3, Zoma promises that a great evil will one day return to Alefgard. This foreshadows the events of Dragon Warrior 1, where a great evil once again returns to Alefgard. However, in Dragon Warrior 1 this great evil takes a notably different form as the " Dragonlord". In addition, upon finishing Dragon Warrior 3, the Hero recieves a new name by the king. The new name is  Erdrick in the original NES version (later changed to Loto in subsequent versions). Erdrick is referenced in the original NES version of Dragon Warrior 1 as a legendary hero who saved the world from great evil in the past. Erdrick's descentdent saves the world once again.[CR]Game Designers:[CR]Female Sage - Character Design by Akira Toriyama Dragon Warrior scenario designer was  Yuuji Horii, who also designed the scenario for all the other main games in the  Dragon Warrior (Dragon Quest) series. The artwork in Dragon Warrior was done by famed Manga artist  Akira Toriyama (author of  Dragon Ball). The music in Dragon Warrior was composed by  Koichi Sugiyama.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Instant Level 99 for Hero[CR]Use the Hero at any Pachisi Track. If you land on a space that lowers the Hero's STR stat by any amount, the next battle fought will instantly raise your level to 99. Only works on the Hero.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Secret Dungeons[CR]Complete the game to unlock 2 Secret Dungeons, with bosses you can fight anytime.

		<plot>[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Terry and his sister Milayou are chasing each other around playfully in their home, when his sister decides it is time to go to sleep. She goes on to mention that their parents told them that if they stayed up too late monsters would come into their room and carry them away. Terry then says (or rather Milayou responds to an unspoken comment) he wants to meat these monster. Milayou calls her brother silly, and the two go to bed. Terry then wakes up (the player now has control over him) and walks into the next room.Dragon Warrior Monsters Screen 1[CR]In the next room he meats a monster who jumped out of a drawer, asking him if he is Milayou. The monster figures out the player is not Milayou and says he has no interest in him and explains he is Warubou from the Kingdom of Greatlog. He then violently knocks the player out of the way and kidnaps Milayou. Moments later another monster jumps out of the same drawer. This monster seems to be clueless on the events that have just occurred, asking where Milayou is. He notices that Terry speaks "monster talk" and asks Terry where Milayou is. Terry explains the events that have just occurred and the new monster remarks about how he was "too late". He then tells Terry his name; Watabou. Terry asks where his sister is and Watabou tells him that if he follows him then Terry may have a chance to find her. Terry jumps into the same drawer both monsters came from and is teleported to a strange room.[CR]In this room he is greeted by an old man in a gray robe. He remarks how Terry "must be the master". He tells Terry that he is in the Kingdom of GreatTree and he must go pay his respects to the king. He further explains that the kingdom is created inside a big tree and the castle is at the very top of the tree. Inside the throne room Terry is greeted by the minister of the kingdom who tells Terry that the king has a request of him and pleads him to comply with his request. The king's request is for Terry to enter the Starry Night tournament, and win. Terry says he would rather find his sister. The king tells Terry that the winner of the Stary night Tournament is granted a single wish, and he could use that wish to find his sister. The king offers Terry some monsters and sends him out to Pulio the master of the monster farm.Battle Scene[CR]Once at the farm Pulio accuses him of trying to steal his monsters but quickly figures out that Terry is actually the new master and not a thief, apparently by his scent. He then confesses to Terry that he only has one monster left, as the rest have all been stolen! Slib, the favorite monster of the previous king. Back in the throne room the king displays surprise that Terry picked such an old weak monster. He calls in Pulio and demands to know if the monster "Hale" escaped too, Pulio confirms that Hale did escape. The king then says he is throwing Pulio in the dungeon for his mistake. Terry, being the good guy he is, says he will catch Hale in order to save Pulio from his fate. He then tells Terry that Hale has escaped through one of the Travelers' Gates. If Terry can bring Hale back, Pulio will be pardoned.Room of Beginning[CR]After progressing through the first gate, Terry finally meets up with Hale. Hale claims he does not want to go back to the castle, but after beating him he says he would like to go with Terry on his adventures. Back at the throne room the king displays delight over the fact that Hale has been brought back to him, only to learn that Hale would rather go with Terry. The king, is a sudden change of actions, decides he is happy over this choice and frees Pulio. Terry is informed that there are rivals waiting to fight him at the arena.Dragon Warrior Monsters Screen 2[CR]At the arena, Terry wins the first two matches he is able to fight the final challenger of the G-ranked battles, the Principal of the Master School. The Principal of the Master School comes onto the state and introduces himself. After winning the match Terry is told the king wants to talk to him. The kind tells Terry he is proud of him for winning G-class, but in the middle of the conversion someone barges into the room. He asks the king how he is going, addressing him as "King of GreatTree". The stranger reviles that the king is the host of the tournament this time around and tells the king he must fight with honor. The man then looks at Terry and remarks him as a "cute little child" and asks him if he was "playing with the king". He then tells Terry that he is the King of Greatlog, the kingdom that kidnapped his sister.[CR]The king begs Terry to win, reveling his dislike towards the other king. The king opens up the Room of Villager &amp; Talisman as a reward for Terry winning in G-class.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game is a monster collecting, breeding, and fighting RPG. The player can have up to three monsters at one time and when they catch other monsters, they must go into storage. The turned-based combat is much like the other Dragon Warriors games and, expanding on the monster befriending mechanics of Dragon Quest V, the player wages battle exclusively through up to three monsters. The player can order these monsters to either choose their own attack by simply selecting the Fight command, or can manually choose what attack that they want their monster to use; however, the monster must like the player enough to listen to him. Raising a monster's adoration to the player more involves feeding them meat.[CR]The player is able to breed monsters based on gender, type, and what family the monster is from. When the player breeds two monsters, the monsters picked by the player will disappear, leaving only the offspring of the parents in an egg form. Every monster is part of a family of monsters, which are all predetermined.[CR]Slime Family - Monsters that appear mostly as small drops of slime. They are one of the more popular types of monsters in the Dragon Quest series. They are very balanced monsters.[CR]Beast Family - Contain some of the more brutal monsters, as they have high attack and HP stats.[CR]Bird Family - Bird-like creatures that have high agility in fights.[CR]Bug Family - Resistant to poison, and have decent attacking and defending capabilities.[CR]Dragon Family - Very, very strong monsters, but have stunted leveling capabilities.[CR]Plant Family - The main magic users for the game, as they have high intelligence and MP stats.[CR]Zombie Family - Weak monster family, but have incredibly high HP stats.[CR]Devil Family - Mainly physical attackers, as they have high attacking/defending stats.[CR]Materials Family - Tanking monsters, they have very high defense and are resistant to spells.[CR]Boss Family - Made up of monsters that the player fights as bosses. They are difficult to breed, but are the strongest monsters.[CR]Different family combinations will yield different creatures when breeding monsters. After two monsters mate, an egg will be left behind that the player will then have to pay a fee to hatch the egg. This gives the player the chance to get rid of the monster if they don't like the outcome of the breed, but will not receive the parent monsters back from the transaction. The monster that the player has bred will have traits from both the mother and father, and will also possess some of the abilities from them as well.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level up-SUPER EASY[CR]Beat Durran, then get to the special Family Maps (areas where only monsters of a specific family will appear). Find the Slime Family map and go to a level near the end. You should be able to find Metabbles here. If  you have an amazing amount of attack or any of a few attacks that can pierce Metallic Immunity, you can take out Metabbles before they flee. One metabble is worth a sickening amount of experience- over 20000 when you have 3 monsters, possibly over 60000 when you have only one monster.</plot>

		<title_clean>Dragon's Lair</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Dirk the Daring's fluid animation and unparalleled visual detail helped make Dragon's Lair a hit.[CR]Dragon's Lair was first released as a Laserdisc arcade game in 1983 by Cinematronics, featuring artwork created by former Disney animator Don Bluth. Because of the relatively large storage capacity of the laserdisc, Cinematronics were able to create a game that featured higher fidelity graphics than other contemporary games. It was also a highly influential title of its time, opening the floodgates to several other laserdisc titles, such as Space Ace, Bega's Battle, and Cliff Hanger.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Dragon's Lair puts players in the greaves of Dirk the Daring, a knight trying to rescue the Princess Daphne. Daphne has been kidnapped by Singe the Dragon, and is now being held in the castle. Dirk's adventure will have him battling monsters and the castle alike as he attempts to save the day.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Dragon's Lair played like an animated Choose Your Own Adventure book.[CR]The gameplay of Dragon's Lair varies wildly from version to version, a common misconception is that the "Quick Time Event" game is the only version of Dragon's Lair in existence, however on platforms like the NES and SNES, Dragon's Lair is a 2D platformer requiring players to navigate multi-tiered stages, finding one of multiple exits to complete a level and progress through the castle to the final boss fight. The QTE-focused game only appears on certain platforms, in this variation of the game players watch and sometimes control Dirk through his adventures though Singe's castle. At very specific intervals during the game, Dirk will be in a situation that will force the player to control him, choosing which to direction to move him in around or having him attack enemies. Each of these sequences would trigger a new scene in the movie to start playing, similar to the way a DVD can have different "chapters" to select at any time. Choosing the right action in these confrontations would cause Dirk to circumnavigate his obstacle with aplomb, while choosing the wrong action would trigger a sequence in which Dirk is killed. The player is helped out by some degree of input clues such as flashing lights letting them know the direction to push. Added help to these sequences was added in the iPhone version which by default causes the on screen controls to flash the correct input, although this feature can be turned of if desired. The limited, simple button pressing gameplay set to cinematic action that would later evolve into the Quick Time Event, featured in games like Shenmue, Resident Evil 4, and Heavy Rain.[CR]In the original arcade version, the castle's rooms were presented in a semi-randomized order. The player would advance to a new room regardless of whether they could complete the previous one, however before the final confrontation with the dragon, the player would be required to replay the scenes they failed. In addition many of the rooms played "in reverse" (meaning, a jump to the left became a jump to the right the second time a scene played) meaning that even if one were to memorize every room in the castle they would still have to keep a keen eye on the layout of each room. The high score table was usually part of a separate cabinet extension.[CR]An experienced player who memorized every input for every scene could complete the game in less than 10 minutes. These experienced players soon realized that the player's score was increased with every successful input, regardless if the scene ended in success or failure. Thus, the score could be inflated by purposely dying before the last move of a long scene, and saving the last "life" for the final scene with the dragon. As new lives were rewarded throughout the game, these players could extend their play time to 20 minutes or more on one credit.[CR]Development[CR]Dragon&#8217;s Lair was the brain child of Rick Dyer, president of Advanced Microcomputer Systems, who, supposedly, realized that video games needed top quality animation during a viewing of the animated film The Secret of NIMH. He also claims that the Atari 2600 classic &#8220;Adventure&#8221; was another inspiration for Dragon&#8217;s Lair. The entire game was animated by Disney Animator Don Bluth at his personal studio. The game was made in less than 7 months for a mere one million dollars (cheap considering the work they were doing with new technology). The animators on the game couldn&#8217;t afford to hire real models to provide an appropriate frame for the Princess Daphne, so Cinematronic&#8217;s team apparently used Playboy magazines as an inspiration.[CR]Xbox Live Arcade Port[CR]On March 19th, 2012 it was announced that Dragon's Lair was coming to Xbox Live Arcade. The port is developed by Digital Leisure and published by Microsoft Studios. The Xbox Live Arcade port includes support for the standard controller, as well as Kinect.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Special Mode[CR]At the Main Menu, press Right, Left, Right, Up. A sound effect will confirm proper entry.</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The game puts the player in the role of John Tanner, an undercover cop who is chosen to work undercover due to his superb driving abilities. The missions are given to you by a mob boss. These missions can involve anything from tailing someone to see where they go or completely removing them off the road. As you play undercover you are no longer seen as a member of the law, so the police are always trying to stop you, adding a real sense of excitement. Your wanted level is measured in the form of a felony bar which increases every time you break the law; this also includes simple errors such as skipping a red light or speeding. The game does come with its very own speedometer. There is a single player campaign to play through in which you unlock different challenge modes to play through.[CR]Single Player Campaign[CR]The campaign begins with a compulsory tutorial level in a car park, which shows the player all the different techniques that can be used in the game, including burnouts and handbrake turns. Once the tutorial is completed, the player is plunged into Miami, starting off with various tasks such as being the getaway driver in a bank robbery, or delivering a fast and fragile supercar without damaging it. Tanner's work eventually takes him to other cities like San Francisco, Los Angeles, and New York. Once the game is finished there is a hidden level in Newcastle, England (as this is where the production team was from). This level isn't fully fleshed out and acts as more of an Easter egg than a real location.[CR]Non-Campaign play[CR]Training[CR]In Driver, there are two different training stages, the first being the Car Park and the second being the Desert.  The Car Park training is more of a close-quarters test of driving skill where you will have to preform such challenges as; a Burnout, using the Handbrake, doing a Slalom through support columns, a 180&#176;, a 360&#176;, a Reverse 180&#176;, Speed, Brake Test, as well as complete a full lap around the outer perimeter.  The player will be forced to play through and complete all challenges before starting the Single-Player Campaign and taking jobs from the "Get A New Job" option from the answering machine in the players apartment.  The Desert course is more of a slalom course made up of cones and barricades where the player has to try and get through as quickly as possible, with as little damage to the car and as few penalties; from hitting the cones barricades, telephone poles or trees.Take a Ride[CR]From the very beginning of the game, the player can choose to drive freely, with no objectives, around the cities of Miami and San Francisco. Once the other cities are unlocked in the campaign mode, they are playable in this free mode.Pursuit escape[CR]In pursuit escape the player must outrun the police in a number of scenarios arround the various cities in the game.Checkpoint[CR]Checkpoint mode features a series of checkpoint races around the various cities from the game.Carnage[CR]In Carnage the player must attempt to cause as much damage do the environment as possible in various locations across the cities available in the game.[CR]Comparisons[CR]Often seen as a Grand Theft Auto clone, Driver differs in many ways. Firstly, the police are much stricter in this game than in the GTA series, often chasing you for running through a red light, or driving on the pavement for example. Also, the focus on driving removes attention from the lawbreaking attributes of GTA, as pedestrians cannot be hit, and the player cannot leave the car to cause mayhem. Another thing worth noting is the fact that Grand Theft Auto 3 was not released until 2001, two years after Driver's debut on the PlayStation One. Driver was one of the first open world, fully 3D games of its kind.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Cheat Menu[CR]When you're at the main screen, at undercover, press the following commands, and you will be able to access the Cheat Menu, giving you all areas, invincibility, and other cool stuff.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Stage Select[CR]From the main menu screen, highlight and Choos Undercover.

		<title_clean>Dropzone</title_clean>
		<plot>Dropzone was the first game to propel Archer Maclean to stardom. The game, originally written for the 8-bit Ataris, is basically a Defender clone, but popular because it so closely recreates the gameplay of the original Defender, with its speedy scrolling and frantic gameplay.[CR]The player is a spaceman with a jet-pack, flying across a barren landscape whose skies are inhabited by a number of different aliens; from the simple Planter to the slowly advancing Blunder Storm or the quick, aggressive Nemesite. [CR]Planters and Nemesites will try to pickup the small men walking on the surface, who must then be rescued. You must shoot down the alien, while avoiding to hit the man. Sometimes, the aliens will carry an android, which is similar to the human but deadly. Care must be taken so as to not pick up the androids. All men must be transported to a surface base, where they are put in safety. This is the Dropzone.</plot>

The Game Boy Color iteration features an official license of the 1998 season and thus all 11 authentic teams, drivers and tracks from that year. Unlike the Nintendo 64 version the game is completely in 2D and is viewed from a 3rd person perspective.[CR]The game tries to deliver the most realistic racing experience on a handheld of its time. You can manually adjust many aspects of the car before each race, such as transmission, gear, and tyre types and the alignment of your spoilers.[CR]The game features five playing modes (Grand Prix, Exhibition, Challenge, Time Trial and Two Player), two difficulty settings and allows for three separate save games. You can turn damage and different weather types on and off.</plot>

For example, the whole concept of Star Points, which was such an important part of the console game has been removed. Left is a football game with a quite ordinary style. Due to the Premier League license all twenty teams are real and have real world players (16 in each team). The gameplay resembles the style of many classic games in the genre and is viewed from an top down perspective. Play modes available are friendly match, full season or a custom league of the players' choice.</plot>

The Game Boy Color port was originally released in 1999 in the US and 2000 in Europe. There are over 60 selectable teams included in this version.Game Modes[CR]In the Game Boy Color version of FIFA 2000 there are five different game modes to choose from:Exhibition - Exhibition mode is the standard one match game mode. The team for both the human and A.I. players can be chosen. There are also several options that can be changed in this mode.Tournament - In tournament mode the player chooses a team to play as. After a team has been chosen a group, either A, B, C, or D will be chosen and the player will play in a tournament against those teams.Playoff - Playoff mode plays much like the tournament mode, except the player does not choose a group to play against, all opposing teams are chosen by the game.League - League mode is like a career mode from other sports games. The player chooses a team and then proceeds to play through a season.Indoor - In the indoor mode the player chooses both the player and A.I. teams. This game mode is very similar to a regular exhibition match except the ball will bounce off of the walls and there are no out of bounds.[CR]Genesis/Mega Drive Version[CR]The mobile phone version was ported by EA and TecToy to Mega Drive (mostly as a built-in game) in Brazil under the name FIFA 2000 Gold Edition.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level Passwords[CR]Level Passwords</plot>

		<title_clean>Force 21</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Force 21 Splash Screen[CR]Released in the latter half of 1999, Force 21 is a tactical real-time strategy game for the PC both developed and published by Red Storm Entertainment. It is set in the year 2015, and depicts a scenario in which the United States and the People's Republic of China are drawn into military conflict with one another after China decides to invade Kazakhstan for resources. After choosing to align with either the U.S. or China, the player assumes the role of battlefield commander, directing upwards of sixteen individual platoons, usually consisting of some combination of tanks, wheeled vehicles, and helicopters, during a variety of different combat operations. Missions can have between one and three objectives, and while the player's initial forces for each scenario are always predetermined, each platoon can be assigned a unique platoon commander with specific strengths, and units can furthermore be transferred between platoons as necessary during missions. Force 21 also features a multiplayer component allowing up to four players to compete in scenarios either individually or as teams. In late 2000, a port of Force 21, developed by Code Monkeys, was released for the Game Boy Color. This port differed significantly from the original game, most noticeably by replacing the original's third-person perspective and three-dimensional graphics with a top-down, strictly two-dimensional viewpoint.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]By the year 2015, advances in technology have all but eliminated the threat of global nuclear warfare, ushering in an age in which more conventional ground wars between powerful nations are an increasingly practical option. In more recent years, a shift in power has taken place within the Asian continent. As Russia slides slowly toward irrelevance, crippled both socially and economically, China expands and prospers, increasing its influence through the sheer force of its economy while also keeping a firm handle on any political dissidents. Realizing that their country cannot sustain its current growth rate over the long term without additional resources, China begins sizing up neighboring Kazakhstan and the weaken Russia, whose raw materials would help to further stoke the Chinese economy. Noticing a significant buildup of troops along the western border of China, the U.S. quickly sends a military force to Kazakhstan, hoping their presence there alone will be enough to dissuade the Chinese from attacking. Unfortunately, not even the added complication of U.S. involvement is enough to turn China away from its bid to claim oil-rich Kazakhstan for itself. Not long thereafter, the People's Liberation Army crosses the Sino-Kazhak border, and World War III officially begins.[CR]The trajectory of Force 21's campaign mode changes significantly based on the player's chosen allegiance. As an American commander, the player must push back against the Chinese advance into Kazakhstan and Mongolia before eventually advancing on China itself, buoyed by the support of oppressed rebel groups within the country who welcome them as liberators. As a Chinese official, the player is entrusted with the success of the initial Kazakh invasion as well as that of the subsequent invasions of Mongolia and Russia, allowing China to not only fully realize their goals but also force the American and Russian coalition to surrender.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Players have access to a wealth of information even before entering missions.[CR]Force 21 is a real-time tactical wargame in which the player directs groups of units from the third-person, moving them and assigning them various tasks in order to overcome enemy platoons and accomplish mission objectives. Missions in Force 21 are separated into two distinct phases: the Preparation Phase and the Action Phase. During the Preparation Phase, players are familiarized with the details of the mission to come and given the opportunity to select individual commanders for each of the platoons that will be under their control. Commanders are rated from one to five in the areas of movement, combat, and detection, which determines their overall strength in these areas. Additionally, each commander is specialized in either Armor, Recon, Air Cavalry, or Engineering, giving units additional movement, accuracy, and detection bonuses when their chosen commanding officer is specialized toward their use. Apart from selecting platoon commanders, the Preparation Phase is mostly informational, giving the player access to three displays that fill them in on their mission's parameters. The Mission Briefing screen contains information on the player's objectives, the Mission Setup interface details units and commanders available for the coming mission, and the Intelligence pane allows the player to examine a 3D map of the projected area of engagement. Each subsection of the Preparation Phase interface is accompanied by a voice-over from an allied officer with advice for the coming mission.Two T-90UKs overlooking the remains of an enemy light vehicle platoon.[CR]Once the player feels they are sufficiently prepared to take on the mission proper, they may initiate the Action Phase, which starts the mission and gives the player full control of their platoons' actions in real time. Platoons can consist of up to five units each, and orders given to a platoon are carried out by all units within it. Orders cannot be given to individual units, however units can be transferred between platoons. Unlike many similar strategy games that allow players to freely scroll their viewpoint around the battlefield, the player's point of view in Force 21 is restricted to only what the currently-selected platoon's leader can see. This is accomplished by binding the game's camera to the lead unit of the selected platoon; the player can change the angle and orientation of the camera, but cannot detach it from the platoon. This restricted visibility in effect simulates the fog of war phenomenon, as platoons can only detect enemies within a short distance of themselves, and in turn can only be ordered to attack once the player has ascertained the enemy's location, thus placing a significant gameplay emphasis on situational awareness and effective reconnaissance. Players that are able to detect enemy platoons before they themselves are detected are at an advantage. Players also have both a minimap and a larger 3D Strategic Map to consult while in missions, with allied platoons appearing either as blue blips or letters corresponding to their platoon, and enemies represented as red blips.A detailed 3D Strategic Map is available for use at any point in a mission.[CR]Aside from reconnaissance, many other factors come into play when completing objectives and confronting enemies in Force 21. The game's environments can play a crucial role in successful encounters, as players can take advantage of beneficial defensive terrain features such as trees or use natural line-of-sight obstructions like hills to cover their advance. Platoons can be placed into one of four different formations (Line, Column, Wedge, or Reverse Wedge), which can have a noticeable impact on factors such as movement speed and weapon coverage. Choosing which units to engage the enemy with is also very important, as vehicles generally fall into specific categories, with some being more well-equipped to handle certain threats than others. Helicopters, for instance, are easily torn apart by anti-aircraft vehicles, while tanks similarly must watch out for fast MCVs with anti-tank weaponry. A number of specialty vehicles also exist that can perform tasks such as clearing minefields or laying bridges, and even general-purpose units may have additional command options that may benefit them in certain scenarios. A tank may be able to fortify its position against enemy fire, for one, and a recon vehicle might camouflage itself in order to reduce the chances of detection. Since missions are objective-based, defeating all foes within a map is not always necessary in order to proceed to the next mission, and failure conditions can also vary depending on the imperatives of the operation at hand.Platoon Orders[CR]The Platoon Orders Menu is located at the bottom right of the player's in-game HUD, just below the platoon and formation selection interface, allowing easy access to common unit commands. Actions that can be taken by the currently-selected platoon will be highlighted, indicating that they can be performed, while orders that said platoon cannot be issued will be grayed out and unselectable. Issuing an order is typically done by left-clicking the appropriate button and, when necessary, left-clicking again within the 3D world view. Generally speaking, an order in the process of being issued can be cancelled simply by right-clicking the mouse.MoveMoveHotkey: MNormally issued simply by right-clicking the ground while the desired platoon is selected, the Move command orders a platoon to travel to a specified point on the map. Traversal over long distances can be ordered more easily by way of the Strategic Map; waypoints can also be set while issuing a Move order by simply holding down the Shift key while clicking.PatrolPatrolHotkey: PBeing a sort of specialized Move command, a Patrol order allows the player to specify that the current allied platoon is to patrol along a set of given coordinates until told to do otherwise; this is perhaps most useful for reconnaissance or defensive purposes. The direction in which the platoon patrols after the order is given is not specifiable by the player.RallyRallyHotkey: RThe Rally order is issued in much the same way that other movement orders are, though it is a command uniquely intended for use when units are taking enemy fire. When the Rally order is issued to a platoon, the player must select a point on the map, which directs that platoon to disengage from all enemy units before moving immediately to that point.HoldHoldHotkey: BackspaceIssuing a Hold order causes the selected unit or units to drop whatever they may have been previously ordered to do. Arguably the most obvious use for this command is in situations where an ally unexpectedly discovers an enemy platoon. Ordering this platoon to immediately Hold may prevent the enemy from noticing and targeting them in many cases.Deploy CamouflageDeploy CamouflageHotkey: CCertain vehicles (like LWVs) have the ability to stop and deploy camouflage, reducing their overall detectability. Normally consisting of netting and assorted bits of cover, camouflage causes a unit's detection signature to be reduced by fifty percent. Camouflage cannot be deployed while moving, so Deploy Camouflage causes any moving platoon to stop.Fortify PositionFortify PositionHotkey: FLarger combat vehicles, namely tanks and MFVs, can be issued the Fortify Position order at any time. This causes the unit to dig into its current position, erecting fortifications that offer a degree of additional protection against enemy attacks. Much like Deploy Camouflage, a unit can only erect and receive benefits from a fortification while stationary.Artillery AttackArtillery AttackHotkey: AWhen the Artillery Attack order is activated, left-clicking the map will cause that point to be targeted for artillery bombardment. This order is unique in that it can be used by platoons that do not actually contain artillery units. In this case, the player's artillery units will fire upon the designated zone from wherever they may be, relying on other units for spotting.Set Helicopter HeightSet Helicopter HeightHotkey: HPlatoons that contain helicopters are able to toggle the height at which these units fly. Choppers are either considered to be flying high or low, with the Set Helicopter Height button being illuminated in the case of the former. High-flying helicopters are able to avoid fire from some weapons, while low-flying helicopters are better able to avoid detection.Set EW ModeSwitch EW ModeHotkey: EVehicles outfitted with electronic warfare options are able to toggle between different EW modes as necessary. The default radar mode extends the normal range of the unit's sensors, boosting detection capability by fifty percent. Pressing the button will switch to jamming mode, making the unit much easier to detect while reducing nearby units' detectability.Deploy/Recover BridgeDeploy/Recover BridgeHotkey: BBridge layer units have the unique ability to lay down a bridge over certain obstacles that would otherwise be impassable. When deploying a bridge, the mouse cursor will turn green if the player hovers over an area that can support a bridge. After crossing this bridge successfully, the bridge layer can be ordered to retrieve the bridge for possible use at a later time.Deploy/Clear MinefieldDeploy/Clear MinefieldHotkey: NA select few vehicles have the ability to both place and clear out minefields. Pressing the Deploy Minefield button will allow the player to designate a point on the map for the platoon to deploy their payload. In the event that the player selects an area of the map that already possesses mines, the minelayer will instead clear all mines from the targeted zone.Launch Air StrikeLaunch Air StrikeHotkey: XThe Launch Air Strike command calls in a bombing run over the specified target. Unlike other orders, the Air Strike is not carried out by units within the player's platoon, but rather temporarily calls in an aircraft, which departs after completing the strike. In missions where it is available, the number of available Air Strikes is shown in the game's HUD.[CR]Units[CR]Force 21 features several different unit classes, with units being assigned to a particular class based on their primary role on the battlefield. More often than not, the default platoon composition will group units of the same or similar classes together, though it is always possible to reassign units to other platoons once the missions starts. Though the player cannot control units on an individual level, it is possible to reassign the lead unit on the fly. Since a unit's ability to detect is tied to its facing, the player is able to specify what direction the platoon is to face by holding down the left mouse button while issuing a move order or by clicking and dragging the pointer within the Battlefield Compass. Individual unit integrity is displayed by way of a color-changing bar above the unit's portrait in the game's Platoon Control Panel; a green bar indicates that the unit in question is not damaged at all, yellow signifies that the unit has sustained some damage, but is otherwise operational, while a unit that has dropped to red status has been completely incapacitated.Main Battle Tanks[CR]Main Battle Tanks, or MBTs, represent the player's primary firepower throughout Force 21. They are well-armored, fast, and, most importantly, very deadly. They are a go-to unit in many situations, capable of making short work of other vehicles, especially those that might be less durable and less offensively-focused. When stationary, MBTs have the ability to erect earthen fortifications, making them even tougher to overcome.T-72T-72 Main Battle TankAffiliation: RussiaThe T-72 is the first MBT available to players upon choosing the U.S. portion of Force 21's single-player campaign, and it is one of the weaker tanks in the game overall. Because of this, it is even more important for T-72s to tip the odds in their favor, either by flanking or other means, as in a fair fight they will oftentimes lose to other, more advanced tank platoons.T-90UKT-90 Command TankAffiliation: RussiaThe T-90 Command Tank is a step above the T-72 in terms of strength, being roughly on par with the PLA's Type 90-II. China's Type 90-IIs will often outnumber the player's T-90s, however, so it is usually prudent for the player to stack the odds in their favor in whatever way they can, such as by grouping a platoon of T-90s with anti-tanks support vehicles.M1A3M1A3 Abrams Main Battle TankAffilitation: U.S.A.Appearing at about the midway point of the U.S. campaign, the M1A3 Abrams MBT is clearly superior to earlier tanks available to the Americans as well as their Chinese counterpart, the Type 90-II. It is a particularly powerful unit when its long range capability is exploited. Unfortunately, Abrams tanks are not usually received in extremely large quantities.XM-2015XM 2015 Future Combat SystemAffiliation: U.S.A.Representing the cutting edge in American military hardware, the XM 2015 FCS only begins to appear very late in the campaign, however their rapid-fire rail gun technology ensures that they are invaluable units once deployed. It is not uncommon for players to have only a handful of them at their command, making intelligent usage extremely important.Type 90-IIType 90-II Main Battle TankAffiliation: ChinaThe Type 90-II is a workhorse MBT used in large numbers by the PLA during its invasion of Kazakhstan. It is more powerful than Russian tanks, though not quite on par with the Americans' M1A3. Being somewhat middle-of-the-road in terms of strength, Type 90-II's benefit greatly from being grouped with other support platoons that boost their firepower.XT-22XT-22 Experimental TankAffiliation: ChinaThe PLA's ultimate MBT, the XT-22 Experimental Tank is second in strength only to the United States' XM 2015. With both a powerful main gun and an additional anti-air, anti-armor missile launcher, XT-22s are well-equipped to handle just about any threat that comes their way. They become available to players about halfway through the Chinese campaign.Mechanized Fighting Vehicles[CR]Mechanized Fighting Vehicles, also called MFVs or Infantry Fighting Vehicles (IFVs), are much lighter on armor and firepower than MBTs, though they enjoy a noticeable boost in speed and maneuverability as a result. They are primarily fire support vehicles, offering backup for the tougher MBTs that can tip the scales against their enemies. By themselves, MFVs are not quite as intimidating, though they respond quicker than tanks.BMP-3BMP-3 Infantry Combat VehicleAffiliation: RussianThe Russian BMP-3 is available to players primarily during the Kazakh portion of the U.S. single-player campaign. It has enough firepower to go toe-to-toe with enemy tanks, however its lack of durability as an MFV means that this is best done when the enemy is caught unawares. It similarly can do very well when used against LWVs and other units in its class.M2A3M2A3 Bradley Infantry Fighting VehicleAffiliation: U.S.A.The M2A3 Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicle is one of the toughest units outside the MBT classification, having almost as much firepower as a standard tank. It is comparable in strength to the PLA's Type 91-III APC, and can engage a wide range of targets effectively. Like other MFVs, its main handicap is its lack of armor when compared to MBTs.M2A3-ADM2A3-AD Bradley Stinger Fighting VehicleAffiliation: U.S.A.Commonly known as the Linebacker, the M2A3-AD trades the standard M2A3's anti-tank capability for TOW missile racks, making it a credible threat to enemy aircraft. The Linebacker still has some capacity to attack hostiles on the ground, however, unlike the Bradley IFV, it is only truly effective in this case against lightly armored targets.Type 91Type 91-II Armored Personnel CarrierAffiliation: ChinaAs the PLA's basic armored personnel carrier, the Type 91-II is equipped to take on lighter threats, but doesn't fare as well against heavier, more specialized fighting vehicles. Type 91-IIs are generally only safe when attacking LWVs, as they are somewhat underwhelming when compared to other MFVs, and they are completely outclassed by enemy MBTs.Type 91-IIIType 91-III Armored Personnel CarrierAffiliation: ChinaUnlike the Type 91-II, the Type 91-III is well-equipped to serve as fire support for allied tanks, being perhaps the PLA's most notable unit for this purpose. In terms of strength, the Type 91-III is on par with the M2A3 Bradley IFV, being potent enough to dispense with vehicles in several different classes, provided they can successfully avoid taking return fire.SPAAGTwin 37mm SPAAG Self-Propelled Anti-Aircraft Gun SystemAffiliation: ChinaMuch like the M2A3-AD Bradley, China's SPAAG is focused on anti-aircraft duties, though it is equipped with a pair of flak cannons for this purpose as opposed to the Bradley's anti-air missile system. The results are largely the same, giving it a great deal of lethality against enemy helicpoters, but significantly less when countering other vehicle types.Light Wheeled Vehicles[CR]Light Wheeled Vehicles, also abbreviated as LWVs, are essentially armored cars, and as such they are less durable than the average MFV. Since they are limited in the number of armaments they can carry, LWVs intended for combat are usually specialized toward fighting a particular type of vehicle. In many cases, LWVs are designed for reconnaissance rather than combat, with the capability to detect enemies from long range.BRDM-2BRDM-2 Scout VehicleAffiliation: RussiaAs the name implies, the BRDM-2 is suitable for scouting, and not much else. Armed only with machine guns, the BRDM-2 well make barely a dent in the armor plating of heavier attack vehicles. For this reason, they are best used in order to seek out an enemy's location before allowing slower, more well-armed units to take advantage of this knowledge.BRDM-3BRDM-3 Reconnaissance VehicleAffiliation: RussiaThe BRDM-3 is very similar to its direct predecessor, the BRDM-2, though it does come with some teeth that the earlier variant lacks, namely a rack of anti-tank guided missiles. This allows the BRDM-3 to cause some significant damage to enemy armor. It should not be mistaken for a proper fighting vehicle, however, as it will easily crumble under heavy fire..50 CalM1026 HMMWV-MG Long Range Scout Surveillance VehicleAffiliation: U.S.A.The standard Humvee, equipped with a single 50 caliber machine gun, is essentially the American equivalent of the BRDM-2. Like its Russian counterpart, it is more a liability than an asset in combat engagements. As a reconnaissance vehicle, the Humvee is harder for enemies to detect than other units, especially when it is ordered to deploy camouflage.TOWM966 HMMWV-TOW-2 Anti-Tank VehicleAffiliation: U.S.A.Mounted with a TOW-2 system rather than a 50 caliber machine gun, the TOW Humvee is, unlike the recon variant, fully capable of taking out armored enemy vehicles. Additionally, it enjoys the same low detection profile that other Humvees do, making it a perfect candidate for ambushes, striking at an enemy before they detect it, then falling back to do so again.AvengerM998 HMMWV-ADA Avenger FAADS SAM SystemAffiliation: U.S.A.The third Humvee variant in Force 21 sees the vehicle equipped with air defense missiles, allowing it to shoot down enemy aircraft such as helicopters. It is also equipped with a 50 caliber machine gun for use against ground targets, but, as with the Scout Humvee, this has little effect on most units. It is best kept in the company of other protective units.WZ 550WZ 550 Lop Nor 4x4 Multi-Purpose CarrierAffiliation: ChinaThe WZ 550 is a bog standard scouting vehicle, with almost no offensive capability to speak of. Like other units in its class, the WZ 550's main asset is its wide detection radius and slight detection signature, allowing it to see without being seen. If noticed and targeted, its only practical means of survival is to simply retreat and allow other units to do the fighting.WZ-ATWZ 551-AT 6x6 Armored Personnel CarrierAffiliation: ChinaThe WZ 551-AT is most akin to the BRDM-3: a recon vehicle with a little firepower to back it up. Due to the lack of armor inherent to LWVs, fighting other vehicles, especially larger ones, with the WZ 551-AT should be done with care. In order to avoid being destroyed, they should usually attack from an opponent's blind side before retreating to repeat the attack.WZ-ADWZ 551-ADA 6x6 Mobile Air Defense SystemAffiliation: ChinaThe WZ 551-ADA is one of China's main anti-aircraft vehicles, and one of the most prevalent during the Chinese campaign. As both an LWV and a dedicated anti-air vehicle, it is extremely vulnerable to any hostile ground units, and should therefore be accompanied at all times by more traditional ground units in order to avoid being picked off easily.Electronic Warfare Vehicles[CR]Consisting of units with specialized detection and jamming equipment, Electronic Warfare (or EW) Vehicles are unique reconnaissance units that use advanced electronic equipment to not only boost detection but also dampen the enemy's ability to detect allied units. While in some cases an EW Vehicle might possess weaponry, their utility in either obtaining or denying information far outstrips their ability to cause physical damage.BMP-1BMP-1K Radar Jammer VehicleAffiliation: RussiaThe Russian BMP-1K is the only dedicated EW Vehicle to also have a modicum of offensive capability, though in practice this only allows it to tackle foes within the LWV class. Despite the presence of armaments, it is a far more useful vehicle when used purely for its detection and jamming capabilities, either boosting detection or reducing signatures.M1037-EWM1037 HMMWV Electronic Warfare VehicleAffiliation: U.S.A.The Americans' preferred EW vehicle is the M1037-EW, which is essentially a Humvee equipped with the latest in electronic warfare technology. Unlike the BMP-1K, the EW Humvee has no means of protecting itself at all, giving even more incentive to keep it in the company of other allied units at all times, if the benefits to detection weren't already enough.WZ-EWWZ 551-EW Radar Jammer / Radar Intercept VehicleAffiliation: ChinaChina's answer to the American military's dependence on electronic means of detection, the WZ 551-EW is more or less functionally identical to the EW Humvee developed by the United States. It is all but useless in a stand-up fight, but its ability to divine the presence of enemies at long ranges and shield allies from detection is invaluable in any mission.Engineering Vehicles[CR]Engineering Vehicles are units designed to serve very specific needs that may arise in battle. The first type of Engineering Vehicle is designed either to lay mines or sweep them from an area. The second type is able to deploy and retrieve temporary bridges that other units may pass over. In either case, Engineering Vehicles have very little use outside these areas, and are best kept clear of combat situations whenever possible.IMR-2IMR-2 Combat Engineering VehicleAffiliation: RussiaThe IMR-2 is a Russian-made minelaying vehicle with the capacity to both place and clear minefields. While it has a few weapons to its name, the IMR-2 is in almost all situations defenseless against enemy attackers. Even when laying mines, the IMR-2 should not be left alone, and ideally it should be placed in a platoon with more offensive vehicles.GrizzlyM1 "Grizzly" Engineering VehicleAffiliation: U.S.A.The Americans' "Grizzly" Engineering Vehicle is all but identical in its utility to the IMR-2, functioning solely to deploy and recover mines wherever it is directed to do so. Like its East Asian counterparts, the Grizzly will be quickly decimated if caught in a combat situation, so players should take care to make sure that it does not venture far without escort.M1-AVLBM1 "Wolverine" Heavy Assault Bridging VehicleAffiliation: U.S.A.Known as the Wolverine, the M1 Heavy Assault Bridging Vehicle carries with it a deployable bridge that can be used to bypass certain obstacles, such as rivers, that might otherwise prevent passage. Once placed, units may cross over to the other side of the obstacle, at which point the Wolverine may recover the bridge in order to use it again, if necessary.MTK-3MTK-3 LeClerc Engineering VehicleAffiliation: ChinaLike the Russians' IMR-2 and the Americans' Grizzly, the Chinese MTK-3 carries a payload of mines that can be deployed wherever their commander sees fit, and can recover mines that have already been laid. While the MTK-3 does have weaponry, it is not designed to partake in a firefight by any stretch, and should be protect against such an occurrence.MTU-AVLBMTU-72 Armored Vehicle Launched BridgeAffiliation: ChinaThe MTU-72 AVLB does for the Chinese what the M1 Wolverine does for the U.S., hauling a bridge with it wherever it goes that can be placed over otherwise impassable types of terrain. This bridge can be recovered afterwards and reused if needed, however the MTU-72 has no utility when it comes to an actual firefight, and ideally should avoid enemies.Artillery Vehicles[CR]On occasion players may be given command of self-propelled Artillery Vehicles, which can move and attack at extremely long range. Artillery Vehicles may fire upon enemies within their field of view, as any other offensive vehicle can, however they can also fire on opponents well outside their visual range. This can be accomplished by using the Artillery Attack command, which calls a strike at a locale designated by the player.2S192S19 Self-Propelled Artillery SystemAffiliation: RussiaThe 2S19 is a Russian self-propelled Artillery Vehicle, being increasingly lethal the further it is from its target. At close range, the 2S19 has very little way to defend itself, especially against helicopters, so even though they typically remain well behind the front lines, it is not a bad idea to include escorts in their squad in the event that enemies do encounter them.CrusaderXM 2001 Crusader Self-Propelled 155mm HowitzerAffiliation: U.S.A.Able to fire more rounds per minute over greater distances than the 2S19, the XM 2001 Crusader is clearly superior to its Russian counterpart, though it differs little in its basic functionality. Like any artillery platoon, the Crusader should have a position in the rear, where it can cause extreme damage with as little chance of enemy contact as possible.XN-203XN-203 Self-Propelled GunAffiliation: ChinaThe XN-203 is China's one and only option for self-propelled artillery fire, and to this end it fulfills its duties quite well. In terms of overall strengths and weaknesses, it does not differ overmuch from the 2S19 or the XM 2001. Defense against enemy ground and aerial forces is a necessity if they are to be kept operational, as their close range performance is poor.Helicopters[CR]Helicopters are the only directly controllable aerial units in Force 21, and as such they have a number of properties unique to themselves. The most obvious is their ability to adjust height, which allows them alternately to avoid detection and avoid light weapons fire. They are very strong against most ground units, including heavily-armored tanks, but must be wary of enemy anti-air units with the ability to quickly shoot them down.Hind-FMi24F Hind-F Heavy Attack HelicopterAffiliation: RussianThe Russian Hind-F is the first Helicopter available to the player in the U.S. single-player campaign. They possess an extremely potent weapon array, however they are of the more fragile helicopter types in the game. Due to their lack of durability, it is oftentimes prudent to use them in conjunction with ground forces in order to ensure they are not easily targeted.AH-64 ApacheApache AH-64D Longbow Attack HelicopterAffiliation: U.S.A.Apache helicopters are powerful enough to consider using without the support of other units, though one should still be wary of leaving them open to attack. Anti-air units, as is always the case with helicopters, are the Achilles' heel of the Longbow, so players should constantly be on the lookout for these vehicles if they send out an Apache platoon on its own.RAH-66RAH-66 Comanche Light Attack / Reconnaissance HelicopterAffiliation: U.S.A.The Comanche Helicopter is an impressive unit both in terms of attack power and information gathering. Though their lethality is to be expected given their weapons payload, the real surprise comes in their spectacular reconnaissance potential. Not only are Comanches hard to detect, they have the ability to see fully twice as far as their own detection radius.CheetahCheetah Heavy Attack HelicopterAffiliation: ChinaThe Cheetah exists somewhere between the Hind-F and the Apache in terms of overall strength, making them more useful in the early game, but less so once later choppers begin to appear. They do not have quite enough armor to make brazen attacks against their enemies, so their best bet is to attack from outside their foes' firing radii, taking them off guard.Z-9Z-9 Daulphin Light Attack HelicopterAffiliation: ChinaLike the Cheetah, the Z-9 Daulphin rests squarely between two U.S. units in terms of potency, in this case the Apache and the Comanche. While not quite as impressive as the RAH-66, the Daulphin does have many of the same capabilities. Most notably, it is a stellar reconnaissance unit that can transition seamlessly from recon to attack mode when needed.[CR][B]Reception:[/B][CR]Critical response to Force 21 upon its release ran the gamut, with the aggregate opinion judging it to be of passable quality rather than exceptional. Reviewer Michael E. Ryan of GameSpot gave it a 6.7 out of 10, saying that, while it was "not a bad game," it was ultimately a frustrating experience. Among the flaws cited by Ryan were lackluster unit pathfinding, vague or misleading mission objectives, and an unintuitive interface for changing unit facing. Perhaps the most positive review of Force 21 came from PC Gamer, which gave the game a 90% and an Editors' Choice award. PC Gamer's Stephen Poole was also critical of the game's pathfinding, but did not seem to take issue with the game's interface or single-player missions, instead praising both the single-player and multiplayer components of the game.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Cheat Menu[CR]At the Main Menu, press Left, B, Left, B, A.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level Passwords[CR]On the title screen choose the Password option, then enter one of the following passwords.

		<title_clean>Game &amp; Watch Gallery 2</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Game &amp; Watch Gallery 2 (Game Boy Gallery 2 in Japan and Game Boy Gallery 3 in Australia) was released on November 1, 1998 for the Game Boy Color. The game was developed and published by Nintendo. Game &amp; Watch Gallery 2 includes five different games (as well as several unlockable games), in both the original Game &amp; Watch version and an updated version. The game was also compatible with the Super Game Boy, which gave it a border that looked similar to the original design of the Game &amp; Watch.[CR]Games[CR]Each game is a simple Game &amp; Watch game that also features an updated version (called the "Modern" version). The Modern version features upgraded graphics, sound, and animation. The games all give the player three chances to "miss" one, and if three misses are made then a game over is prompted.[CR]If the player can make 200 points on a game, then it unlocks a star. Stars can be used to unlock several things, such as other games and a music room.ChefThe Classic version of Chef.[CR]The Modern version, relatively different from the Classic version. Peach is hitting food with a pan while Yoshi catches it in his mouth. They move simultaneously when controlled with the control pad. Food must be bounced until it becomes "cooked," otherwise it will not be worth as much when fed to Yoshi and will prevent him from growing. If food is bounced too much, it turns black and disappears, and will also cause Yoshi's growth to move backwards.[CR]In the classic version, there is only one person with a pan who bounces several pieces of food. In this version, there is a cat in the upper-left hand side of the screen who will occasionally run interference by catching the left-most piece of food on a fork and release it at a random time.Donkey Kong[CR]In Donkey Kong, Mario must be guided to the top of the stage, as with the traditional Donkey Kong gameplay. Unlike many of the other games in Game &amp; Watch Gallery 2, other buttons than the control pad come into effect, as the A button makes the character jump in both versions (Mario or Mr. Game &amp; Watch, depending on the version). Other than animation, graphical, and sound differences, the Modern and Classic are relatively similar.HelmetIn the Modern version of Helmet, Mario must hit the buttons.[CR]In the Classic version, tools are falling and Mr. Game &amp; Watch must reach the other side without getting hit by a tool. If he manages to do so, he loops back over to the other side of the screen. In hard mode, the door on the right side will randomly open and close instead of remaining open or shut at regular intervals.[CR]In the Modern version, Mario must avoid hammers, spikes, and fireballs being dropped by a Paratroopa while trying to hit a P-Switch (which opens the door). After Mario scores 500 points, the door will lead him to a new area where the Paratroopa will drop spikes into a random array of cannons which will change their trajectories and make their destinations much harder to predict. After reaching a score of 1000 points, Mario will be taken to an area similar to Bowser's Castle where he will have to dodge fireballs and Thwomps instead of falling hammers.[CR]If the player fails to score 100 points or more in Modern Mode and immediately selects "retry" upon seeing the "Game Over" menu, Mario will be replaced by Wario.ParachuteFear not, hungry sharks are here to assist you.[CR]In the Classic version, Mr. Game &amp; Watch must rescue characters who parachute out of a helicopter at the top of the screen. Each of these characters falls at the same rate of speed. The one difference between Normal and Hard modes is that occasionally the parachutist farthest to the right will snag on the palm tree to the right and detach at a random, unpredictable time.[CR]Characters in the Modern version vary between Toad, Yoshi, and Donkey Kong Jr. The three characters vary time at which they open their chutes. Toad always opens his after jumping, Yoshi varies the time at which he opens his parachute, and Donkey Kong Jr. always waits until he has nearly reached the water to open his. They drop out of an Airship which sits at the top-left of the screen. A cannon sits on the shore at the far right. Occasionally a character will drift into it and be launched back into the playing field. Also, at 100 point intervals the airship will drop Yoshi eggs which contain both a Starman and a Boo Buddy. If Mario collects the Starman, the cannon will launch more Starmen who are each worth a 5 point bonus when caught. However, if he catches the Boo then the cannon will launch bombs instead, which will cost him a miss if he catches them.Vermin[CR]Yoshi protects a circle of eggs in the Modern version. Enemies approach from all sides, and the player must direct Yoshi to them to hit them with a hammer. No button must be pressed to make Yoshi hit them, as he does it automatically. In the Classic version, Mr. Game &amp; Watch goes back and forth hitting enemies as they come up from underground.Ball[CR]Ball, the very first Game &amp; Watch title, can be unlocked once the player collects 15 stars from the other games. In easy mode the player needs to juggle two balls, while in hard mode the player juggles three. In both "Classic" and "Modern" modes only one miss is allowed.[CR]Once the player collects 25 stars, they will be able to play the "Modern" version. Four different versions of the "Modern" version exist, featuring Yoshi, Mario, Wario, and Bowser. Each of these different versions are unlocked as the player collects more stars, ending with the Bowser version which requires 100 stars. The main difference between the "Classic" and "Modern" modes is that "Modern" mode provides the player with opportunities to earn bonuses by collecting coins and also occasionally presents the player with obstacles that must be avoided to prevent a loss.[CR]Museum[CR]The museum is where players can view movies of other Game &amp; Watch games being played, and also where even more mini-games can be unlocked, although these cannot earn any stars. It's important to remember that some of these games cannot be unlocked without linking to another Game Boy with a copy of the game. The games available to unlock are Ball, Donkey Kong, Oil Panic, Green House, Lifeboat, Donkey Kong Jr, Tropical Fish, Rain Shower, and Spit Ball Sparky.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Gallery Corner unlockables[CR]You can unlock other characters aside from Yoshi to play as in the Ball modern version game by collecting a certain requirement of stars...[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Play as Wario in Helmet[CR]Start to play Helmet on easy. Then lose all of your lives right away. Then hit retry. You will play as Wario instead of Mario! [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Play as Wario in Helmet[CR]After you earn the credits/Staff you will be able to view them again if you want by going to ''View Gallery'' And then Hold DOWN then push the A button. [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Change the border[CR]To change the border start a new game and pause it. Then press B [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Change the border[CR]Play any game using Modern mode and earn 1000 points or more, you will be able to choose Very Hard mode/Star mode  by choosing that game, highlighting Modern mode and pressing 'up'[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Change the border[CR]You can View the Game&amp;Watch Gallery 2's Cast by getting all the Stars. To view the cast again go to VIEW GALLERY and hold up then press A.</plot>

		<title_clean>Ganbare Goemon - Mononoke Douchuu Tobidase Nabebugyou!</title_clean>
		<plot>Another RPG title for the Ganbare Goemon series. Once again you take control of the wily adventurer Goemon and his buddies as they travel through feudal Japan fighting evil in its wackiest incarnations. This time around an evil warlord seems to have taken control of Edo castle and used the place to flood all of Japan with strange demons. [CR]The gameplay is similar to the other RPGs in the series, in which you control your party from an overhead map and explore each area getting quests and items in order to advance the main plot. While you control a party, combat is strictly one-on-one, as the game attempts to join the Pokmon craze with "dueling" combat between individual monsters. Additionally, you can capture and train the monsters you defeat, and even upgrade them or merge them with other creatures to obtain additional powers. The game can also connect with the similarly-themed Mononoke Sugoroku for the N64, in order to transfer and exchange monsters between both titles.</plot>

		<title_clean>Ganbare Goemon - Tengutou no Gyakushuu</title_clean>
		<plot>A unique entry in the Ganbare Goemon series, Tengu-to no Gyuakushu! doesn't place you in the shoes of the wily Goemon and his gang of crime-fighting buddies but instead casts you as a small kid from modern Japan that gets magically whisked away to Goemon's feudal Japan. You'll get to meet Goemon and co. in the flesh and as luck would have it, a unique threat looms over both eras and only you can save the day.[CR]The game plays as a traditional Japanese RPG in which you control a party of up to 3 characters from Goemon's gang and explore the game world getting quests and advancing the main plot. Combat switches you to a turn-based side-view in which your selected "lead" character performs the main attacks and actions while your other characters lend their special abilities in supporting roles.</plot>

		<title_clean>Gex - Enter the Gecko</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Gex: Enter the Gecko is a platforming game developed by Crystal Dynamics (console and PC versions) and David A. Palmer Productions (Game Boy Color port). The game was published by Midway Games (Nintendo 64 releases), Crystal Dynamics (US PlayStation release), BMG Interactive Entertainment (UK PlayStation release), Bandai (Japanese PlayStation release), Eidos (US PC release), Square Enix (PlayStation Vita PSone Classics release), and Ubisoft Entertainment (Outside of the US PC releases).[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]No game is complete without zombies[CR]Gex: Enter the Gecko follows the adventures of the bipedal lizard Gex, an old (at this point retired) action game hero who has lost his passion for adventure and has slumped into a state of intense apathy, now spending every waking second watching TV, ordering Chinese food, eating Chinese food, or watching TV while eating Chinese food. After what could be years in this state, Gex's routine is interrupted by Rez, an old arch-nemesis who wants only to annoy Gex and destroy the world by combining the forces of various TV villains and running rampage on the real world. Gex, co-opted by the government and a crowbar is then tasked to go and save the world again.[CR]Gex's struggle takes him from old rerun series to old rerun series as he collects TV remotes to try and turn off the plans of Rez. To aid him in his quest Gex can wear special suits to feel more at home in the show he's in and break old TVs to gain powerup bugs that reside inside such as fire and ice breath, 1ups, health pickups, and others.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] revolved around collecting remotes by completing objectives or reaching the end of a level. These were red remotes that were collected as Gex completed either specific objectives that, when selected from the TV in the hub world Gex would receive a clue for, though any objective could be completed regardless of what hint was chosen. These remotes served a similar function to Mario 64's Power Stars or Banjo-Kazooie's Jiggies.[CR]There are also white or silver remotes that are unlocked either by collecting 3 different tiers of items which varied from level to level, but always had some joke attached to them or amusing significance, or by finding the hidden white remote in a level. These remotes unlocked the special stage areas where the player can unlock yellow remotes that when every remote was collected, the "true" ending of the game was shown when the player defeats REX in the final boss.[CR]The game largely revolved around its 3D platforming. Gex has a variety of moves at his disposal to defeat enemies. Between the spin attack where he would spin his tail around in a sweeping motion, the coil jump which had the added bonus of launching Gex further up (though slowing his forward momentum) and the kung-fu kick which launched Gex forward straight into his enemy but inflicting slightly more damage than a spin kick, Gex was sorted.[CR]Camera control and player movement can be controlled with both left and right analog sticks as well as the D-pad and shoulder buttons. Entering a first person mode is done when both shoulders are held. The game also has a Metroid-style password system so that those who could not (or did not) use a memory card could carry over their remote completion over to their next play session. This, however, did not save the number of extra lives.Stages[CR]Gex features a large selection of levels that were all accessed via a large hub-world. The levels are inspired by different movie genres. Examples:Toon TV: A parody of Looney Toons. Gex, over the course of different levels will turn into an anthropomorphic rabbit character, a large duck, and fight giant cartoon styled enemies.Scream TV: A tongue-in-cheek homage to horror movies. Gex must contend with ghosts, Frankenstein's monster, zombies, mummies, bats, and giant bouncing skulls as he made his way through dressed like Dracula.Sea-Span: Centered around a Titanic-like ship. Exclusive to the N64 version.Circuit Central: A Tron-styled world that, like its inspiration, takes place inside a computer-styled world. There were really annoying floating electric things everywhere.Kung-Fu Theatre: A group of levels which featured a whole pile of ninjas, throwing stars, and giant death traps. Controlled by an evil pig named Mooshoo Pork, who is the boss of the second area.Rocket Channel: A Star Wars/Star Trek-themed level with no regard for subtlety in its references and had Gex dress up like Luke Skywalker.The Pre-History Channel: Tarzan-themed world too that took place in ancient times. Dinosaurs are everywhere, and there was far too much lava. Gex dressed as a caveman.[CR]Game Boy Color Port[CR]The Game Boy Color port of the game features the same stages as the console versions but are much smaller in size. The Game Boy Color port is also played in a 2D side-scrolling style rather than the polygonal 3D platforming of the console versions.[CR][B]Reception:[/B][CR]The game was reviewed rather poorly, being compared to Mario 64 and criticized sharply for poor audio, repetition and poor dialogue. Jeff Gerstmann reviewed it at a 6/10 mentioning that its redeeming qualities stemmed mostly from stealing concepts from Mario 64 and ended with:[CR]"I'm hesitant to call it a good game, but one thing's for sure - it's better than Croc."[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] All Remotes[CR]Enter the code below by holding the indicated button and pressing the direction at each spot.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Password for 255 lives[CR]Enter the password screen, enter the password.</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Sir Arthur with Princess Prin Prin[CR]Ghosts 'N Goblins (known in Japan as Makaimura, translated to Hell Village) is a 2D side-scrolling platformer developed and released by Capcom in arcades on September 17, 1985. Players control a knight (named Sir Arthur) who must battle legions of demons, ghosts, and other undead creatures in order to save Princess Prin Prin from Satan, King of the Demon World.[CR]Known for its unrelenting difficulty, the game was later ported to various systems, including the Nintendo Entertainment System (by Micronics), Commodore 64, Commodore 16, Amiga, ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, IBM PC compatibles, Sharp X68000, and Game Boy Color. The game received numerous sequels (maintaining the platforming feel of the original) and spinoffs (such as the Gargoyle's Quest and Maximo series).[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Arthur starts the game with the lance[CR]Ghosts 'N Goblins is a side-scrolling action game with platforming elements. The game has six stages with a boss at the end of each stage. Upon completion of all six stages, the player has to repeat all six stages again with increased difficulty before finally beating the game. There are five weapons in the game: Axe, Dagger, Lance, Torch, and Shield. Sir Arthur starts the game with the lance, but can pick up other weapons as they are dropped by enemies. Enemies include zombies, red demons, dragons, ogres, and other monsters. The shield must be equipped to enter the final stage and complete the game.[CR]Ghosts 'N Goblins is often regarded as one of the hardest games ever made. It only takes two hits from any attacking foe for Arthur to die, and considering the player's supply of just 3 lives, completing Ghosts 'N Goblins is considered to be very difficult. There are, however, ways of improving both the quality of Arthur's armor and how many extra lives he has. Better armor can be found throughout the game in a few hidden locations. The extra lives are earned by first scoring 20,000 points, then 70,000 points. Thereafter, the player gains a new life for every additional 70,000 points they earn.[CR][B]Weapons:[/B][CR]WeaponDescriptionLanceThe Lance is Sir Arthur's starting weapon. It travels in a straight line and will go off the screen unless it connects with an enemy.KnifeThe Knife works similarly to the lance in the sense that it travels in a straight line and will go off the screen unless it connects with an enemy. The main difference is that it travels at a faster speed than the lance, but is weaker.TorchThe Torch, when thrown, travels in an arc and when it strikes the ground fire is emitted that damages enemies who touch it making it a powerful weapon. However, only two can be thrown at a time.AxeThe Axe travels in an arc similar to the torch and only two can be thrown at a time. The difference is that it can pass through enemies and doesn't emit fire on the ground. The axe is considered to be the worst weapon in the game due to the awkward throwing arc and its property to pass through enemies is not very useful.ShieldThe shield travels in a straight line like the lance and knife, but has a very limited range. However, it can destroy any enemy projectiles it collides with making it very useful. This weapon must be equipped to be able to enter the final stage.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Final Boss Password[CR]To fight the final boass, enter the following as your password.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Final Boss Password[CR]Code to activate a harder game.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Final Boss Password[CR]Last level for second quest[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Final Boss Password[CR]Level Warp passwords[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Final Boss Password[CR]Level Warp Passwords[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Final Boss Password[CR]The passwords for the levels in quest 2 are as follows.</plot>

Like any great strategy game, HEXCITE is simple to learn, but challenging to master. And every round is unpredictable until the last play. Who knows?

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Godzilla chilling  downtownAfter 1998, the year that saw the release of an Americanized   Godzilla, the filmmakers were stumped as to where to go next. The film hadn't done terribly at the box office, but sales certainly hadn't been what the film's creators were hoping for. A planned trilogy, the sequels were lying around and people weren't sure what to do with them. In the end, the concept turned into  Godzilla: The Series, a Saturday morning cartoon airing on Fox Kids. This cartoon actually turned out to be quite successful so... as one might imagine, a video game was to follow.    Crave Entertainment published and   Crawfish Interactive developed the game of the same name for the     Game Boy Color. Released in 1999, the game was played in an on-rails format. Players took control of the        towering giant himself and went to work in defeating numerous foes unleashed by a...         certain someone. Players could not move Godzilla left or right, but they could make him crouch; A and B functioned as attack buttons. Players went through the levels bringing down the military forces until reaching a monster boss at the end of the level.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level Passwords[CR]Enter the password[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level Passwords[CR]Start a new game, then enter the following.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level Passwords[CR]For full power on the last stage, enter the following as your password.</plot>

		<title_clean>Grand Theft Auto</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Grand Theft Auto was originally released in 1997 for the  Playstation and  PC. The game is set in three different fictional cities:  Liberty City,  Vice City and  San Andreas. Each city is  loosely based on a real-life city. Liberty City is based on  New York, Vice City is similar to  Miami, and San Andreas is loosely adapted from  Los Angeles.[CR]The main character is dropped into the game world and does various odd jobs for the local  crime bosses. Progress through the different cities is done by earning money from completing missions assigned from various pay phones.[CR]Evolutionary Differences[CR]A number of major differences exist between Grand Theft Auto's design and that of the later games in the series:Mission failure is strict and inflexible. There is no option to return to a failed mission, it is simply gone forever.Money can be earned from  killing people and crashing cars.Three distinctly different cities are included. Subsequent games in the franchise would go on to focus on just a single city, with the  Grand Theft Auto III trilogy re-imaging the three cities contained in this game.The only modes of transportation are ground-based vehicles and walking/running. Boats, planes and other, more exotic forms of transportation were not included in the game.Support for internet and LAN multiplayer game modes. These would not officially return again until  Grand Theft Auto IV, though there would be unofficial patches to Vice City and San Andreas' PC versions to include similar functionality.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]The PC version of the game lets players pick from eight characters while the playstation version only lets players choose the four male characters. There is no difference in the characters in the actual gameplay, the only real difference is when players change the characters name.TravisKatNikkiDivineTroyKivlovUlrike[CR][B]Soundtrack:[/B][CR]Radio '76 FM[CR]Genre: Funk*Ghetto Fingers - "On The Move"*Ashtar - "Aori"*Stylus Exodus - "Pootang Shebang"Brooklyn Underground FM[CR]Genre: Trance*Retrograde - "Benzoate"*Government Listening Post - "E104"*Trancefer - "Figiwhiz"The Fix FM[CR]Genre: Techno*Animal Testing Centre - "DSP"*Rotorman - "Ride"*Technophiliak - "Lagerstar"The Fergus Buckner Show FM[CR]Genre: Country*Sideways Hank O'Malley (and The Alabama Bottle Boys) - "The Ballad of Chapped Lip Calquhoun"Head Radio FM[CR]Genre: Pop/Rock*Reality Bubble - "Days Like These"*Meme Traders - "Automatic Transmission"*Ohjaamo - "Complications"It's Unleashed FM[CR]Genre: Alternative/Hard rock*Stikki Fingers - "4 Letter Love"*The Hounds - "Let It Out"*Bleeding Stump - "Just Do It"N-CT FM[CR]Genre: Hip hop/Rap*Da Shootaz - "Grand Theft Auto"*Slumpussy - "This Life"*CCC Featuring Robert DeNegro - "Blow Your Console"[CR]Freeware Release[CR]On December 23rd, 2004, Rockstar announced that they would be releasing both Grand Theft Auto and Grand Theft Auto 2 as freely downloadable packages on their website.

		<title_clean>Grand Theft Auto 2</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The top-down view that GTA was once known for.[CR]Grand Theft Auto 2 was the sequel to DMA's " Grand Theft Auto" which was a PC and Playstation title. Grand Theft Auto 2 would have a similar top down style to the original game, but with enhanced game mechanics and graphics. This was the last of the Grand Theft Auto games to use a strict top down camera. The game was first released on the original Playstation in October 22, 1999 and then two days later for PC. Grand Theft Auto 2 was also ported to both Game Boy Color and Dreamcast. There has been some criticisms of all versions that the storyline was lackluster and that the rewards for completing missions was disproportionate to the cost of items in-game.[CR][B]Multiplayer:[/B][CR]The PC version of GTA2 included IP to IP multiplayer. This means that there were no server browsers and that most games were privately hosted in an era when broadband connections still had relatively low market penetration. The multiplayer had severe lag due to this networking model and was called "unusable" by most users. It should be noted that once someone is in Multiplayer, the map is drastically reduced, and most AI features are turned off.[CR][B]Soundtrack:[/B][CR]Head RadioApostles of Funk - Yellow ButterPussywillows - Real LoveDavidson - All I Wanna DoThe One - SouthparkBula Matari - Taxi DriversFlytronix - PendulumAnna - Do It On Your OwnTesting - My Tiny WorldStikki Fingerz - Holdin' It Out For YouConor &amp; Jay - Vegas RoadTrack 7 - I Wanna Phunk[CR]KREZNegro Vs.

		<title_clean>Hands of Time</title_clean>
		<plot>As the young Sebastian, gamers take the role of the son of a brilliant scientist who has discovered a means to travel through time. Time travel has already taken place in this reality, however, and Sebatian's first mission is to use his father's discovery to return to the past and destroy an earlier time machine, which upset the balance of power in a past war and led to dangerous realities in their present. Just as Sebastian enters the machine to travel back to the past, he watches helplessly as his father is kidnapped and taken prisoner.[CR]You play as Sebastian, the soldier sent back in time to rectify the present. Hands of Time features an overhead view and six levels, each of which is comprised of a small overworld with various objectives. Much of the game requires completing item-swapping sequences in order to progress, while avoiding enemy soldiers along the way. You have a small pistol with infinite ammo. You can collect better weapons, though their ammo is limited. There are no difficulty levels and no multiplayer; you can jump to any of the six levels by use of a password system.</plot>

		<title_clean>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a game made by EA based on J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter franchise. The game is based on the second book and film in the series of the same name. The game follows the plot of the book for the most part, although random missions were thought up to add length to the game, like multiple missions where you have to save or help other pupils.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Inside Hogwarts.The game starts out at Ron Weasley's house, where some chores must be taken care of in which the player will play some mini-games.After that, the player gets sent to Diagon Alley. Here, the game actually adds the first additional gameplay sequence by expanding on the little side trip Harry makes.After this sequence, the player gets taken to Hogwarts, where the game begins in earnest.Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets' gameplay is somewhat similar to that of Bully (Canis Canem Edit or Bully: Scholarship Edition), Rockstar's over-the-top highschool simulator.The player will need to take classes to advance the story. Upon taking one of the classes, the player will be sent into a backroom of the classroom in order to retrieve a spellbook associated with that class. The player will come across a spell that turns giant blue eggs into birds if the "Transfiguration" class is taken, while the "Incendio" spell that sets object aflame will be learned in the "Defence against the Dark Arts" class.In between classes, players can also take missions from pupils. The game has a day/night cycle, and some missions must be done during nighttime. When it's dark, prefects will roam the halls of Hogwarts, as well as the grounds outside. Like in the books, there is always a contest going on between the houses in points, which are gained by doing things well in the classes. If the player is caught by a prefect or Filch however, some points will be lost. Magical trick items like dungbombs and certain spells to distract these watchmen can be purchased.While missions are not being done, Hogwarts castle and the grounds surrounding it can be freely explored.There are some odd jobs that can be done as well. the player can become champion of the dueling club, trade stuff with fellow pupils, attempt to make other houses lose points and run people over with a broom.[CR]Additional Information[CR]The Lumos spell reveals more than you might imagineThe player will eventually receive a broomstick, the Nimbus 2000. This broom can be obtained at any time while outside, though not in missions where the player has to go to the Forbidden Forest. This can actually be used to make certain missions easier, for instance; in one mission, school prefects must be avoided while trying to get across the school grounds in order to get to Hagrid's house. The broom can be used to fly across the school grounds, avoiding that part of the mission entirely. The broomstick can also be used to reach otherwise inaccessible part of the castle, like certain rooftops.There are huge differences between the PlayStation and PlayStation 2/Xbox versions of the game. For instance, while Harry travels to Diagon Alley with flu powder, things go wrong. On PlayStation, the player must attempt to keep Harry on the middle of the slide with the analog stick. On PlayStation 2 however, this sequence is not present at all, and the player simply gets dropped off in a cutscene. This is one of the few examples of the PlayStation game having more content in a gameplay sequence. For the rest of the game, this tends to be the other way around.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The second and final Harvest Moon game to be released on Game Boy Colour, it is a direct sequel to Harvest Moon 2. Released only in Japan and later the US, it features a variety of different features that have gone on to become staples of the Harvest Moon franchise, such as multiple animals and horse racing.[CR]It differs from the previous handheld installments in that there are two playable characters, a boy and a girl.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Pete[CR]Boy (Pete)[CR]Is invited by Mr. Heinz to help run the farm with the girl character following his successes in Flower Bud Village. Sara[CR]Girl (Sara)[CR]Takes over her fathers farm after travelling for many years. Has no experience in farming but is proficient with animal care.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The boy character from Harvest Moon 2 is approached by a man called Mr. Heinz who informs him of an opportunity to revive a small farm on an island. The farm was originally run by the girl character's father and has since been left in disuse. The girl has taken up ownership of the farm but is inexperienced, and so Mr. Heinz asks the boy to help her.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Duplicate Items, Easy Cash[CR]Go to the shipping screen. [CR]Choose an item (Press ''A'') that you have A LOT of. [CR]Move to the maximum # that you have for that item. [CR]Press ''B'' to cancel away. [CR]Choose an item (Press ''A'') you want a lot of, whether it be expensive of something you need for a job. [CR]Press Down once. This number should be many more than what you actually have, usually appears as one less than the total of the item you wanted to sell. [CR]Press ''A'' and sell that amount. [CR]Go back into the screen, and notice you have many more than you did. Repeat if desired. [CR]NOTE: This trick is many times more effective if there is a larger amount between items (55 and 1) [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Duplicate Items, Easy Cash[CR]Okay..first of all, you have to do enough part time work to get to this one. After doing a series of work, talk to the lady at the farmers union in the part time work corner. Keep rejecting the jobs she offers you, untill she tells you about catching the River King in 120 days. Select yes, then run back to your farm and call the farmers union. Tell them that you have completed the job! (note: you don't have to actually go out and catch him!) After that, the people will say stuff like you've really comepleted the job and send you the money right away! At 6:00 pm, you will be 72000 richer! That includes bonuses for completing it 120 days early of course. This really works!</plot>

		<title_clean>Hercules - The Legendary Journeys</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Hercules: The Legendary Journeys is a Nintendo 64 and Game Boy Color game from Titus (based on the hit television show). It centers around one of the most popular Grecian myths, that of Heracles, or, as he is better known, Hercules. The game involves a combination of skirmishes with random enemies and bosses, elementary puzzles, and numerous trading sequences and side quests similar to the ones found in Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. The player can also play as two of Herc's friends, Lolaus and Serena (or the Golden Hind, as the half woman, half horse character is referred to in the game): they each have their own unique attacks and weapons. Legendary Journeys is known to have many bugs and technical issues (alongside its clunky controls) that make the game frustrating and unnecessarily difficult in numerous places. This game proved to be another high profile failure for the once beloved Titus as it continued to plunge deeper into the territory of poorly developed action/adventure games; directly following the release of the critically-despised Superman 64.[CR]Playable Characters[CR]Though Hercules is the primary player character, the player does take control of Lolaus and the Golden Hind during certain moments of the game. Each of these characters have a unique control scheme; unfortunately, perhaps due to a lack of care in the game's development, the other two characters are both exceedingly difficult to control and considerably weaker than Hercules. Nonetheless, the character's attributes are listed below:[CR] Hercules - The strongest and most primarily used of the characters, Hercules' primary attack is the punch by way of pressing the B button. Upon holding the B button, Hercules can also use a "super punch" that does greater damage and can be used to break through weakened walls. Furthermore, although all characters will stun enemies after a certain number of hits (bosses excluded), Hercules is the only character capable of picking up and throwing enemies; instantly killing both the enemy and any other enemies with which the thrown one makes contact. Furthermore, Herc is the only character that can purchase potions from the tavern owner (who exists in all of the game's towns) that unleash lavish special attacks centered around four elements: earth, fire, lightning, and ice. The earth potion drops rocks from the sky upon his unexpecting enemies; the fire potion unleashes burning balls of molten lava upon Herc's adversaries; the lightning potion performs a similar attack by way of giant, thundering lightning bolts; and the ice potion temporarily freezes one's foe(s). These potions are accessed via the C buttons. Although Hercules is the most overpowered of the game's characters, his portions can be nonetheless difficult to play due to a weak camera and the lack of a lock-on system.Iolaus - The sidekick of Hercules, Iolaus is useful as the only character in the game capable of climbing vines (which have an odd graphical similarity to those in Ocarina of Time). However, once he has climbed said vines and reached whatever dangers await him at the top, he is faced with the difficulty of fighting with his exceedingly underpowered staff (perhaps he is Herc's sidekick for a reason, eh?). Iolaus is also useful in one instance in which the snowy alps can only be crossed by a body small enough to fit into the only available winter coat. Iolaus cannot leave any of his designated playable areas however, if the player tries, they are met with the message: "Perhaps I should let Herc take care of this."The Golden Hind - Though christened Serena in the television series, the game (for some unbeknownst reason) refers to her as The Golden Hind. This lady Centaur is, in fact, the weakest of the three characters. The Hind's only method of attack is the shooting of her arrows, done in a first person mode. Although the arrows can be shot in the standard third-person perspective, they are guaranteed to strike nothing unless the enemy lies directly in front of the Hind. The first-person mode is troubling however, as the controls are so unbearably clunky and difficult to use that the player will have almost certainly lost a considerable amount of health by the time he/she was even capable of training his/her sights upon his/her adversaries. Fortunately, The Golden Hind also has the smallest amount of game time between the three characters; and, like Lolaus, is restrained to her respective areas with a message identical to his.[CR]</plot>

		<title_clean>Hexcite - The Shapes of Victory</title_clean>
		<plot>Hexcite is a puzzle game played on a honeycomb-like playing field. In the center is a hexagon; six more hexagons make up the entire playing field. Because of the turn-based gameplay, two people can play using only one system. Two-player link mode is also supported.[CR]Players begin by placing a geometric shape (triangle, hexagon, parallelogram, etc.) in the center hexagon.  The CPU or human opponent then places another shape adjacent (and touching completely on one side) to a previously played piece.  Players score bonus points for completing any full hexagon. Much of the strategy in this game is in tricking your opponent into letting you take a bonus. Bonuses are also scored for placing a piece so that two sides will contribute a score. The game is over when all pieces have been played, or if the remaining pieces cannot be played.  In that case points are subtracted for any remaining pieces, based on the complexity of the shape (twice as many points are subtracted for a hexagon compared to a triangle.)[CR]In Japan, this game has seen several Windows versions, and even has been released as a board game.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Grand Master Level[CR]To access the Grand Master level, win 5 consecutive times at the Master level in 1P mode without saving at any point during the rounds.</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Hype: The Time Quest is an adventure game based on the medieval line of Playmobil toys, with almost all elements in the game modeled after actual Playmobils. The style of game play and story has been called similar to that of the Legend of Zelda series. It was released in 1999 for the PC, and was developed by Ubisoft.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The game opens with a cutscene showing King Taskan IV and his followers holding a celebration. We learn that Hype, a knight serving the king, is engaged to the princess. Suddenly, a man in black armor riding a dragon appears, causing general mayhem. He casts a spell on Hype, turning him into a statue, and then casts another spell that throws him back in time.[CR]Hype&#8217;s statue appears in a ruined courtyard, and is discovered by a young wizard named Gogoud. Gogoud returns Hype to his normal state, listens to his story, and decides to help him. He sends Hype through the Forest to the main city of Torras to find a magical jewel that, in conjunction with the sword in Hype&#8217;s possession will allow him to return to his proper time period. Hype does so, but discovers that the jewel only sent him partway into the future. Consequently, Hype must navigate 3 eras of the past, and collect the necessary jewel in each, before he is able to return to his own time and defeat the Black Knight.[CR]In each era, Hype visits the same locations and frequently meets the same people, allowing us to observe the passage of time. Gogoud is present in all eras to offer assistance, even appearing as a ghost after his death (The voice of Gogoud also provides the narration). Hype takes an active part in the history of each era, although it is not stated whether he is changing history, or creating the society he lived in. Various characters will grow old, have life-changing experiences, and die as the game progresses (children in one era will become bosses later on, former bosses will become allies, etc). Near the end of the game, Hype goes to a magical &#8216;Lost City&#8217;, where he meets a god, although all the player can see are gigantic feet wearing sandals, and the edge of a robe. This god informs him that the Black Knight is actually Barnak, a former god who had been cast out of heaven by the others because of his wicked deeds. When Hype finally returns to his own time, Barnak has taken over, and the oppressed kingdom has taken on a dark, post-apocalyptic atmosphere. Hype climbs the newly constructed Black Tower, defeating hordes of black-armored soldiers and undead creatures, and upon reaching the top vanquishes Barnak and his dragon. With the death of the Black Knight, the skies are clear once more and Hype is reunited with the princess.[CR]Environment[CR]The World Map. Hype will visit the same places at various points in history.[CR]Each time period is unique, with noticeable differences in environment, and the attitudes of characters. The first playable time period, that of Taskan I, is a pleasant summer's day, contrasted by Taskan I himself, who is arguably the most brutal of the 4 kings encountered in the game. The second era is played entirely at night, the third during autumn, and the fourth and final era is an oppressive, hellish wasteland, caused by the Black Knight having taken control of the kingdom. While the kingdom has distinct areas, they are all very much part of the same region, without being the &#8216;desert area, water area&#8217; setup seen in many adventure games.[CR]Town: The main town of Torras surrounding the castle. Here, Hype can purchase healing potions, magic herbs, and repair his armor, as well as take on side quests, besides learning more about the era. The townspeople are varied in their attitudes towards Hype, their King, etc. and some of the town&#8217;s children in earlier eras become major characters, both good and bad, later on. Areas such as the sewers, castle, dungeon, and gladiator arena appear several times as well.Tree village of the bandits.[CR]Forest: Filled with random bandits, wolves and reanimated skeletons. Eventually, a faction known as the Brigands (stemming from the bandits fought previously) begin to inhabits the gigantic, redwood like trees in one area of the forest. This group takes on a politically rebellious role in response to the harsh actions of the Taskans. Most of Hypes allies are located in the forest; they include Gogoud (whose tower is located at the edge of the forest), the Brigands, and the dragon Zatila. The Stonehenge-like magical portal to the 'Lost City' is also located deep within the forest.[CR]Monastery: Sometimes aloof from the outside world, sometimes fully engaged in it to the point of rebellion, the monastery is hidden away in the mountains and is the home of some of the more interesting characters in the game. The Black Tower is eventually built on top of the Monastery.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Hype preparing to cast an electrical spell on some ghosts.[CR]The gameplay alternates between platforming, light puzzle solving and combat. Hype is armed with a magical sword that is used to send out a wind-like attack rather than actually make contact with enemies. Because this is an E rated game, enemies are knocked unconscious rather than killed. If Hype is defeated, he reverts to a statue. Hype also has a crossbow, and can discover different magical attacks throughout the game, some of which are required to advance through areas. Enemies include forest animals, royal guards, bandits, ghosts and skeletons. Each era has multiple boss fights. The bosses are usually the more fantastical aspects of the game, as they range from an impossibly obese monk 10 times your size, to an evil doppelganger of Hype, to a 3-headed dragon made of gold coins.Hype riding Zatila.[CR]Side quests include destroying bee hives and bats, and running timed races. Completion is rewarded either with potions, or a larger quiver or purse, until the final race, when Hype is given the Speed Boots, which allow for faster travel. Halfway through the game, Hype discovers a better set of armor as well. Another recurring game segment is riding Zatila the dragon through the sky to collect energy for the jewels.[CR]After Hype finishes a particular era, he can return to it at any time (and is in fact required to later on). While wandering around is allowed and in some cases encouraged, the mission structure of the game is very linear. Progression of the story flows directly from one area to the next, rather than through individual, loosely connected missions. Games are saved at lecterns located throughout the kingdom.[CR]Conversations are frequent, and although Hype is a silent protagonist, his attitudes are sometimes reflected in his facial expressions. All of the other characters, however, are given unique, often humorous voices and personalities, even the townspeople.[CR]</plot>

		<title_clean>Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The game takes place in Babylon where Indiana Jones meets up with Sophia Hapgood. Meanwhile, the Russians are digging around in old Babylonian ruins. At the request of Sophia, Indy attempts to discover what they are searching for. He finds that they are looking for an "infernal machine" that can be used to converse with the ancient Babylonian god, Marduk. Of course, Indy intends to find it first. Unfortunately though, the machine is broken up into many pieces. Fortunately however, he stumbles upon a tablet that points to the locations of the various pieces. And thus, this is where the game begins.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The gameplay has many notable similarities to the Tomb Raider series. To begin with, Indy is constantly exploring throughout the game. He runs through canyons, fields, and valleys (among other places). During this exploration, he is jumping across chasms, exploring hidden passages, and fighting wild beasts. The fighting system can also be compared to that of the Tomb Raider franchise; players "lock on" to one enemy and then circle around, dodging attacks and returning attacking with a gun, a whip, or fists. Furthermore, there are numerous collectibles hidden in various places which Indy must climb, swim, crawl, and swing to get to. Some items are required finds, while others are bonuses that unlock various special features.[CR]Nintendo 64 Version[CR]From March 1999 to October 2000 a team of eight Factor 5 employees ported the PC version of the game onto Nintendo 64. This version contains numerous improvements such as new lighting, particle system and camera. The music system was changed to use sequenced midi music instead of the PC version's pre-recorded music files and some new compositions were composed by Chris H&#252;lsbeck.[CR]This version of the game only saw release in North America and was only available on the LucasArts online store and at Blockbuster.[CR]Additional Information[CR]Guybrush Threepwood can be unlocked as a playable character via cheats.  Pressing F10 and typing 'Makemeapirate' turns Indiana Jones into Guybrush Threepwood from the Monkey Island series. When using the bazooka it will shoot chickens.There is a hidden room in the game which is a replication of the Barbery Coast in 3D from The Curse of Monkey Island.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Maximum IQ Points Passwords[CR]The following passwords allow you to start the selected Level with the maximum number of IQ Points gathered in previous Levels.

Once again the evil Dr. Claw has brought misery onto the world by unleashing a horrible new virus called the Madkactus virus and it is up to Inspector Gadget, his niece Penny and her dog Brain to stop Dr. Claw and save the world yet again.[CR]The gameplay is a side-scrolling action game as the player takes control of Inspector Gadget, Penny and Brain in five different levels, each with four different areas to explore.  The player will experience enemies and traps along the way and can use famous devices such as the hammer hat, spring arms and rocket shoes to either elude or eliminate enemies or avoid deadly traps.[CR]Along the way, however, Gadget will have to rely on Penny and Brain to reach areas that are inaccessible to him.  Both are weaker in attacking, but are faster and can be used to transverse past traps and deactivate them to let Gadget past or solve puzzles in mini-game form in order to advance to the next area.[CR]Additionally, players can find power-ups such as muffins which will restore health and GG symbols, obtaining 20 of these symbols will give an extra life.  Also MAD symbols will give Gadget three extra lives.  Gadget can also pick up weapon items such as plungers, which can pick off enemies from a long distance or nets which can instantly kill any enemies that it comes in contact with.</plot>

While the ball is in the air it is possible to make a header or bicycle kick.[CR]The game is displayed from the side of the field, except during penalties, when the camera is aimed directly at the goal.</plot>

The game allows players to &#8216;Try to become the world&#8217;s greatest athlete. You can compete in 11 events: the 100-meter dash, 110-meter hurdles, long jump, triple jump, high jump, pole vault, hammer throw, javelin, discus, shot put, and 100-meter freestyle swimming. If you are having problems qualifying in a certain event, use the Practice mode to improve your skills. No matter how you play, all of the competitors are rendered in 3D, and all of the events take place in highly detailed venues.

Arcade mode is the same, except all championships and stages, as well as Jeremy McGrath, are unlocked from the start.[CR]The difference between championships is the engine size - with larger (thus faster) bikes, the player has less time to react, and going head to head into the edge of the track can be a matter of a simple bump in 80cc to a spectacular flip into the stands in 250cc, also because it becomes a lot harder to do sharp turns in a limited space.[CR]While it can be played as a straightforward racing game, by performing tricks the player can obtain some powerups - a bomb will knock down the next opponent, the arrow temporarily boosts bike stats and the shield allows the player to barge into one opponent, knocking him off his bike. There is one big catch - the skull and bones knock the player out of his bike, which can prove to be decisive in a close race.</plot>

		<title_clean>Jurassic Boy 2</title_clean>
		<plot>Jurassic Boy 2 is a game released for the NES by Sachen (a Taiwanese unlicensed game company also known as Thin Chen Enterprise) and later ported to Game Boy Color. You control a pink dinosaur named Chen who stops a mad scientist, Dr. Crachi, from kidnapping his family and obtaining a "gene" that is needed in the future to make complete dinosaurs. The gameplay and level design is very obviously based on Sonic the Hedgehog.[CR]The NES version has normal, Sonic-like game physics, while the Gameboy version has higher jumping and much faster movement. There are seven levels and only bosses in the Gameboy version. Surprisingly, the NES version seems to control much better than the well known pirate, Somari. The main character, Chen, cannot roll along the ground like Sonic, making the game a little more difficult. The Gameboy version seems to be able to work on the original Gameboy, but at a much slower speed, and due to the cartridge's design, it doesn't seem to fit inside the original Gameboy or Gameboy Pocket. It was released in Taiwan in 1994, and is quite rare today. [CR]https://info.sonicretro.org/Jurassic_Boy_2[CR]</plot>

The player can also jerk up the Game Boy Color to flip Kirby in the air, which gets him past enemies and over obstacles.[CR]In Kirby Tilt 'n' Tumble, Kirby realizes that all the stars in Dreamland are missing and it is up to him to find them. Kirby Tilt 'n' Tumble was infamous on the Game Boy Advance SP, due to the location of the cartridge (i.e. actions are reversed).[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Fun with the Title Screen[CR]On the Title Screen, wait a couple of seconds. Small multi colored stars and moons will then appear on the screen. Tilt the game boy left to move the stars and moons left, right to move them right, up to move them up, and down to move them down. [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Warp from 3-1 to 6-1[CR]In 3-1 you have to go northeast from where you started to warp. To do this, jump the first bridge and get to the end. Go across the water to your right, and you will find a tree. He asks you if you want to warp to 6-1 from there.</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The game objective is to line up colored blocks into rows of similar colors to make them disappear. Atari Games originally released it as a coin-op follow up to Tetris, which they were tangled in a legal dispute about at the time. Klax features a conveyor belt at the top of the screen which rolls toward the playing area, delivering a steady supply of colored blocks.

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Kirby Tilt 'n' Tumble (JP: "KoroKoro Kirby", or Roly-Poly Kirby) is a Game Boy Color game in which users utilized the cartridge's accelerometer features to tilt the GBC to move Kirby. The player can also jerk up the Game Boy Color to flip Kirby in the air, which gets him past enemies and over obstacles.[CR]In Kirby Tilt 'n' Tumble, Kirby realizes that all the stars in Dreamland are missing and it is up to him to find them. Kirby Tilt 'n' Tumble was infamous on the Game Boy Advance SP, due to the location of the cartridge (i.e. actions are reversed).[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Fun with the Title Screen[CR]On the Title Screen, wait a couple of seconds. Small multi colored stars and moons will then appear on the screen. Tilt the game boy left to move the stars and moons left, right to move them right, up to move them up, and down to move them down. [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Warp from 3-1 to 6-1[CR]In 3-1 you have to go northeast from where you started to warp. To do this, jump the first bridge and get to the end. Go across the water to your right, and you will find a tree. He asks you if you want to warp to 6-1 from there.</plot>

		<title_clean>Legend of Zelda, The - Oracle of Ages</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Link and Impa in the forest[CR]The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages is a Game Boy Color game released simultaneously with The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons and follows Link's adventures through the land of Labrynna. The game is published by Nintendo and developed by Flagship. The two Oracle games feature unique connection options, allowing players to collect treasure and objects using a link-up or password mode.[CR]The developers intended initially to make three games, all of them representing one part of the Triforce. Upon realizing that this system would be too difficult they canceled the third game and decided only to work on Oracle of Ages and Oracle of Seasons.[CR]Oracle of Ages and Oracle of Seasons release dates were very close to that of the Game Boy Advance. The developers were indecisive as to whether or not they should add Game Boy Advance functionality to the game, because doing so might push back the release date and result in the game coming out after the Game Boy Advance launched. Luckily, the Game Boy Advance was delayed, giving them enough time to add the functionality and the games still came out one month before the Game Boy Advance.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]An example of the side-scrolling gameplay[CR]Oracle of Ages is a traditional Zelda game. Link explores the overworld, gathering clues and occasionally, items. After traveling about, Link makes it into various dungeons (eight dungeons are in this game, referred to as levels) and collects an item within each one that is normally used to go about the dungeon and eventually beat the dungeon's boss battle.[CR]A variety of areas in the game are not in the traditional Zelda style. Instead, they take a style more familiar with the Mario games. In these side-scrolling areas, Link can still use all of his items as usual.[CR]Introduced in this game are Gasha Nuts and Magic Rings. Gasha Nuts can be planted in certain areas around the overworld. After they grow, the seed on the tree can be opened for an item, normally a Magic Ring. Magic Rings can be appraised and then worn, for various effects, from transforming Link into an Octorok, to upping defense.[CR]The game makes heavy use of the Harp of Ages which opens up time portals to go between the past and the present. In the late game there are additional "Tunes" which don't require the usage of a portal to travel through time, allowing players to travel at will between the two times. There are many things that are changed between the two times. One example is that the Black Tower is not finished in the past, but it is finished in the future. Some other buildings also have slightly different layouts depending on the era.[CR]After finishing Oracle of Ages, passwords can be gathered in Oracle of Seasons which can then be told to various NPCs (non-playable characters) in the overworld. After telling the various NPCs the password, an item is presented to Link. Items vary from the Master Sword to a Piece of Heart. After collecting the item, the password given to Link by the character can then be used in Oracle of Seasons.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The game starts with Link dropped into Labrynna. After walking around he finds a woman flanked on all sides by monsters. Upon Link's arrival, the monsters run away and the woman (who turns out to be Impa) asks Link to help her find a singer in the forest. The two find the singer, who is Nayru, the Oracle of Ages, singing and playing her harp for the forest creatures. The demon sorceress Veran emerges from Impa and possesses Nayru's body which causes all time in Labrynna to go into chaos. Impa gives Link a sword and tells him to go see the Maku Tree, who tells Link that he must get the eight Essences of Time to rescue Nayru.[CR]After collecting the essences, Link faces Veran. The game doesn't end after the credits roll, unless Oracle of Ages is being played as a linked game. A cutscene is shown at the end of the game in which Koume and Kotake (better known as Twinrova) plot their revival of Ganon. A code is shown at the end of the game as well, and if typed into Oracle of Seasons when starting a file, the real ending of both games will be shown.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Character DescriptionImageLinkLink is the main protagonist of every official Legend of Zelda game (except for a few games on the CD-i, although those games are not technically considered part of the Legend of Zelda franchise). In Oracle of Ages, Link is sent to Labrynna by the Triforce, and then tricked by the evil Veran into opening seals that protect Nayru. Link then retrieves the Essences of Time and uses them to defeat Veran.NayruNayru is the Goddess of Wisdom, and one of the three goddesses who created Hyrule. In Oracle of Ages, Nayru is a singer. Her voice brings peace to all who hear it; which attracts many visitors. She is possessed by the evil Veran at the beginning of the game, and upon getting free, Veran possesses Queen Ambi instead. Link and her friend Ralph are both attempting to save Nayru from Veran, and Link manages to do so by using the Essences of Time.Veran[CR]Veran is the main antagonist of Oracle of Ages (although Twinrova is the main antagonist of the two games). Veran is the Sorceress of Shadows, and she uses her unique abilities to possess several people in the game (Impa, Nayru, and Queen Ambi). She first appears when she possesses Impa, and harmlessly requests that Link escorts her to Nayru. She tricks him into taking her to Nayru, and promptly possesses her. Link eventually tracks down the possessed Nayru, and manages to defeat her.[CR]Veran escapes, however, and proceeds to possess Queen Ambi. Under this new influence, Queen Ambi begins to build the Black Tower. Upon completion of the tower, she flees to the top floor. When Link manages to make his way up to the final battle, he frees Queen Ambi from the control of Veran. Veran finally transforms into her final form and flies around the room attacking Link. Upon her defeat, the Black Tower begins to collapse, but Link and Veran fall to the base of a tower. This is where their final showdown takes place, and Veran takes on many forms. Link manages to destroy them all, but not before she is able to light the Flame of Sorrow, one of the three flames that is needed to resurrect Ganon.RalphRalph is a friend from Nayru's childhood, and he assists in guarding her. In the beginning of the game, he distrusts Link, but as the game progresses, he begins to like Link more and more. He is a descendant of Queen Ambi, although he never mentions the throne. Ralph appears consistently throughout the game to provide his advice and opinions. He is resourceful and knowledgeable, making him an essential part of Link's success.Queen AmbiQueen Ambi (despite being under the influence of Veran for a large portion of the game) is the queen of Labrynna. Her one true love was lost at sea, so she began to build a large tower so that he could see it and return to her. If Oracle of Seasons is linked to Oracle of Ages, Queen Ambi is able to meet her lover.ImpaImpa is the protector and maid of Princess Zelda. She was originally sent to bring Nayru and Din to Hyrule so that the lands of Labrynna and Holodrum would be safe, but she fails at this quest when she is possessed by Veran. Link must then save these lands. In the beginning of the game, she is under attack by Octoroks, similar to the original The Legend of Zelda. After Veran leaves Impa, Impa gives Link a wooden sword (if it is a linked game, then she will give the player a wooden shield).[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Secret GBA shop[CR]To get a secret shop called the 100 rupee shop, put in your Oracle of Ages game into your Game Boy Advance and then go to Lynna Village in the past.  Then go to the screen where there is the sword aim game, and go to the door to the left of it.  When you get in their it sells 2 rings, one is a Game Boy Advance Ring, thats just for decoration, and the other is usually a peace ring which makes bombs not harm you.  Besides the two ring, you can buy a Gasha Seed, and when it turns into to tree, it will have a ring on it.  Everything is 100 rupees.</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Holodrum[CR]The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons was released simultaneously with The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages, and the two of them make the seventh and eighth games released in the Zelda franchise. The player once again controls Link as he travels on an adventure to destroy evil and rescue Din. There were initially going to be three games released simultaneously, but the complexity of the system made it an impossible feat and the third game was cut.[CR]The development of the game was handled by a company called Flagship. This marks one of the few times a Zelda games production has not been handled first-party by Nintendo. Oracle of Season's counterpart game, Oracle of Ages, focuses more on puzzles whereas Seasons focuses much more on action and combat. The two games can also be linked together via passwords to unlock new items and other things otherwise unobtainable during a regular playthrough of the game.[CR]The release of the game was very close to that of the Game Boy Advance. The development team was unsure whether or not to include special functionality if a player plays the game on a Game Boy Advance, as they feared doing so might push back the release date and thus make the game come out after the Game Boy Advance. When the Game Boy Advance's release date was pushed back, it gave the development team the time they needed to incorporate the new functionality and still launch the game before the Game Boy Advance came out.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]In Oracle of Seasons, the Triforce drops Link in the land of Holodrum. He happens upon a traveling band playing in the forest and meets Din, the Oracle of Seasons. He then witnesses her kidnap at the hands of the evil general Onox. Impa tells Link that they were headed towards the land of Hyrule and tells him to find the Maku Tree. The Maku Tree tasks him with getting the eight essences which will allow Link passage into Onox's castle. What follows is classic Zelda gameplay as Link attempts to obtain all eight of the essences.[CR]The player, as Link, then proceeds to collect all of the essences needed to complete the game. After acquiring them all in a variety of ways, meeting both unique and flat-out strange characters along the way, Link gains entrance to Onox's castle. He defeats Onox and rescues Din. Koume and Kotake (also known as Twinrova) watch Link from afar, plotting their resurrection of Ganon. If Oracle of Seasons in the link game, however, then Koume and Kotake begin to battle with Link.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]A scene from early in the game.[CR]Oracle of Seasons is a traditional top-down Legend of Zelda game. In the game, the player (as Link) must traverse a variety of colorful dungeons to reach the ultimate goal of defeating Koume and Kotake (otherwise known as Twinrova) and rescuing the world from demise. Items and power-ups are collected on the adventure, allowing Link to do a variety of things, from jumping or creating blocks.[CR]One of the central items in the game is the Rod of Seasons. This item allows Link to change the season if he is standing on a tree stump. There are many things in the game which change depending on the season. Examples include lakes freezing over and trees losing their leaves.[CR]A new system implemented in Oracle of Seasons is the Gasha Nut system. By planting a Gasha Nut in fertile soil, a Gasha Tree will grow. The tree will produce fruit, which in turn will grant Link with an item of some sort (usually a Magic Ring, which can subsequently be appraised in a variety of locales).[CR]Like its handheld predecessor Link's Awakening, Oracle of Seasons has some short sections in which Link travels with a side-view (as opposed to the traditional top-down view). This gives off a more " Mario" feel, and some of the the enemies in these sections are actually pulled straight from Mario games, such as Cheep-Cheeps, Podobos, and Thwomps.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Character DescriptionImageLinkThe main protagonist of the Legend of Zelda franchise (although not necessarily the same Link in every adventure). In Oracle of Seasons, Link has been sent to the land of Holodrum by the Triforce. When he arrives, he meets Din and her traveling band. She is quickly kidnapped by the evil Onox, however. To save Din, Link must utilize the Rod of Seasons and collect all of the Essences of Nature to get to Onox's Northern Castle, where the final battle will be.Din[CR]Din is the Goddess of Power, one of the three goddesses who crafted the land of Hyrule. In Oracle of Seasons, she is the Oracle of Seasons. She is a dancer who is kidnapped by Onox in the beginning of the game, which is what most of the game is focused around.Onox[CR]Onox is known as the General of Darkness. He is so evil that it is said he causes the very ground he steps on to become infertile. In Oracle of Seasons, he is the person behind the kidnapping of Din and the misuse of her power to turn the seasons of Holodrum into chaos. He imprisons Din in a large crystal in his castle, and then used his power to send the Temple of Seasons into an underground world known as Subrosia, causing the Rod of Seasons to lose its power. He is also behind the many monsters that Holodrum becomes infested with.[CR]When Link challenges Onox, he uses a large flail to attack Link. When Onox loses to Link, he uses Din (still trapped in the crystal) as a human shield, deflecting most of Link's attacks. Upon his defeat, Onox changes into his true and final form; a large dragon called Dark Dragon. This boss fight is in the side-scrolling mode that the two Oracle games feature. Before his defeat, however, he manages to light the Flame of Destruction for Twinrova (one of the three flames needed).[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Advance Shop[CR]If you're playing on a Gameboy Advance, head to the screen with the Know-it-all Birds Hut. The other house thats normally closed will be open. Inside is a shop that has 2 rings, and a Gasha Seed. All 3 things sell for 100 rupees each. [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Advance Shop[CR]To find the noble sword go to tarm ruins in the area where there is a trunk in the middle of the screen change the season to winter and head west then change it to autum and head west again then change it to spring and head west again and finally change it to summer and head west there you will find the noble sword.</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The first level - 'Just Dig'.Originally an Amiga exclusive, developed by DMA design (later becoming Rockstar North) was met with an exceptional reception and was quickly ported to many different platforms. A puzzle game that requires players to direct a group of green haired, blue-shirted, lemmings from point A to point B. The game is based on the myth that lemmings migrate in large groups and follow a single leader, who would often lead them off a cliff to their demise. In the game, lemmings constantly march in one direction unless they run into an obstacle, at which point they turn around and walk the other way. Being fearless and unaware of their own mortality, the lemmings will blindly run into fire, jump off cliffs, become crushed and fall victim to numerous other pitfalls.The player must command the lemmings to do certain tasks in order to complete each stage and get a certain percentage of lemmings to safety. These actions include digging, using a pick axe to dig diagonally, using their arms (windmill style) to punch horizontally through terrain and building staircases to traverse large gaps.[CR][B]Levels:[/B][CR]All levels in Lemmings consist of at least one entrance, and at least one exit. The aim in each level is to safely get an allocated amount of lemmings towards an exit. Obstacles; such as water, deadly traps and great heights will hinder the lemmings' progress.There are 120 levels in total, split into four difficulty ratings - Fun, Tricky, Taxing, and Mayhem.[CR][B]Skills:[/B][CR]There are eight different skills available for the lemmings to carry out. Each level has a different selection and amount of abilities available. Different situations require the use of different skills.Several lemmings using the 'floater' skill.The skills are:Climbers - Climbers will climb a vertical surface until they reach the end of the surface.Diggers - Diggers will dig downward vertically through any soft surface until they reach empty space impenetrable surface.Miners - These will dig diagonally downward through any soft surface until they reach empty space impenetrable surface.Bashers - Will dig horizontally through a wall made of any soft surface until they reach empty space impenetrable surface.Builders - Will build a 12 step stairway diagonally upwards.Blockers - Will stop walking and block the advances of other lemmings, causing them to reverse their course.Bombers - A countdown will appear above their head, counting from 5 to 0. Upon reaching zero, they will explode.Floaters - Using an umbrella, these lemmings will float down a long drop.Lemmings being nuked.Three other types of commands can be used by the player, these are:Drop rate - The player may increase and decrease the rate in which lemmings fall from the entrance.Pause - The player may temporarily halt the game, this mode can be used to select skills without using any extra time on the clock.Nuke - If the player has reached a dead end and cannot finish the level then this button can be clicked in order to blow up every lemming on the screen.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Digging Through Steel[CR]To dig through steel, turn a lemming that's walking over steel into a Builder.  After one or two planks are laid down, turn it into a Digger.  This also works if there's already diggable material above the steel.  This only works with the Digger.</plot>

		<title_clean>Looney Tunes</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR]Basic Gameplay[CR] Overview In Looney Tunes, you control one of seven Looney Tunes characters and traverse seven different levels, collecting gems and killing enemies. Each character has it's own specific level, along with it's own abilities and attacks. Players have three hearts for health, but these hearts can be healed by potions scattered throughout the levels. Somewhere along the level, players fight a mid-level boss, sometimes twice. At the end of each level, a boss fight occurs, and some sort of prize drops down from the air for you to collect and end the level. After the prize is collected, a bonus level pops up. You can collect gems in this level to get 1ups. This is very helpful, because the game has no save feature.Controls Looney Tunes uses a very familiar platformer control scheme. The A button is used to jump, the B button is used to attack, and the D-Pad is used to move your character.  [CR]Level Rundown[CR] Level 1: Daffy Duck Daffy Duck's level starts out on land, where he can use his frisbee attack (I'm sorry, but since when did Daffy Duck have a frisbee?) to kill the various crows and lizards.  It then transitions to a water zone, where Daffy must swim through the level, killing fish and shelled creatures to finally reach the boss: A giant fish. Character: Daffy DuckWeapon/Attack: FrisbeeEnemies: Fish, Shelled creatures, lizards, chickens, crowsMidboss(es): Yosemite Sam, Marvin the Martian, Underwater Yosemite SamBoss: Giant FishLevel 2: Tweety Bird Tweety's level is a chase scene, where he is trying to fly away from Sylvester as fast as possible. Chester will jump and run after you, but he can also fall into sewer holes throughout the level, where he will disappear for a while. Tweety can be slowed down by flying plants, baseballs, baseball bats, and mirrors, though he can sometimes be actually sped up by these.  Character: Tweety BirdWeapon/Attack: NoneEnemies: Flying pots, mirrors, baseball bats, plants and baseballsMidboss(es): Sylvester's sonBoss: Sylvester the CatLevel 3: Porky Pig In this level, you control Porky Pig as he flies a plane through a sunset sky. You will use his ability to shoot stars out of his plane to defeat sattelites and UFOs. I suppose this level is a play on the tern "when pigs fly". Character: Porky PigWeapon/Attack: Stars shot from planeEnemies: UFOs, Satellites, bombsMidboss(es): WitchBoss: Psychic Spoon-bending StarLevel 4: Tazmanian Devil Taz's level is completely different from the others. It is a time trial in which you have sixty seconds to collect all the meat power-ups from around the level. The environment is made up of moss-covered rocks, which Taz can spin into to destroy. Character: Tazmanian DevilWeapon/Attack: SpinningEnemies: NoneMidboss(es): NoneBoss: NoneLevel 5: Speedy Gonzalez In this level, you control Speedy Gonzalez as he jumps, runs and dances through an ancient temple to defeat his enemies. You will have to avoid spikes and make tricky jumps, as well as outrun the lava that appears about halfway through the level.  There is also a short puzzle sequence, in which you will have to move blocks in the right order to get through and avoid getting crushed.Character: Speedy GonzalezWeapon/Attack: Dancing and causing damaging stars to appear around his bodyEnemies: Bats, frogs, mummies, flying arrows.Midboss(es): Master Frog, Singing MummyBoss: Vampire Bat FormLevel 6: Road Runner Road Runner's level plays a bit like a side scrolling shooter. You do not control his movement as far as distance goes, but you do control his movement from right to left in wherever you are in the level. The level has two parts. In the first part, you must jump on top of rocks to avoid getting hit by them. Second, you fight Wile E. Coyote, who is skiing through the desert with a rocket on his back. You must jump on him while dodging his attacks. Character: Road RunnerWeapon/Attack: JumpingEnemies: RocksMidboss(es): NoneBoss: Wile E. CoyoteLevel 7: Bugs Bunny Bugs' level takes place in pretty much the exact same place as Speedy's. In it, you fight some of the midbosses from previous levels all over again, and then end it by fighting Elmer Fudd. Character: Bugs BunnyWeapon/Attack: FrisbeeEnemies: Bats, frogs, mummies, skeletonsMidboss(es): Master Frog, Rock throwerBoss: Elmer Fudd[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Five Extra Lives[CR]At the Title Screen, press A, B, B, A, Select, Select. You'll hear a confirmation sound and will start the game with 7 extra lives instead of 2. This same cheat will also work on the original Game Boy release of the game.</plot>

		<plot>Looney Tunes: Carrot Crazy is a side scrolling platform game featuring famous Warner Bros. cartoon characters Bugs Bunny and Lola Bunny. After finding out all carrots have been stolen from their garden, as Bugs or Lola Bunny the player will have to investigate. Bugs will have to explore the Warner Bros. studio to find out who stole the carrots.[CR]Like many platform games you walk from left to right through a level. There are five different worlds which represent the surroundings of characters Yosemite Sam, Marvin the Martian, Daffy Duck, Elmer Fudd and the Tasmanian Devil. Each world is divided into several levels. The object of each level is to find all film clapboards present.[CR]Bugs and Lola can jump and hit things with a mallet (or rolling pin for Lola). They also both feature unique special abilities. Bugs Bunny can dig and move heavy chests and Lola can float down safely from large heights with her parasol. Players can switch between characters at any time.[CR]Power-ups in the game include carrots for energy required for special abilities, a super carrot that allows the player to fly like a helicopter (using his ears) and the habanero carrot, which makes the player invincible for a while.[CR]If you collect the letters EXTRA during the level you get to play a small minigame where you have to shoot firecrackers at moving targets.[CR]Each of the worlds ends with a showdown with the major character of that world. Usually this involves running from a vehicle that pursues the player, while avoiding obstacles.</plot>

		<plot>You play as Lucky Luke, lonesome cowboy, who draws his gun faster than his shadow.  In a received telegram you read that Jesse James, Billy the Kid, Pat Poker, and The Dalton Brothers have escaped from jail. You as a good cowboy and law keeper have to catch them and return them back, finishing 12 levels of the game.[CR]Players guide Luke through levels by walking, jumping, climbing and ducking.  There are also objects to collect such as dynamite (which can be used to reveal hidden paths), revolver barrels, sheriff stars and other useful items.  You also have to use collected items to get past a certain obstacle, such as to show a red cloth to a bull, feed a dog with a bone, and so on. Luke can attack enemies by shooting in straight or diagonal directions.  Shooting exhausts the six bullets in your gun's barrel. To kill the bandits, bad Indians, prisoners, you should shoot at them for a certain number of times.[CR]Locations of the levels vary from towns, saloons, and jails, to the prairies, ranches, and Indian village in Cheyenne Mountains. At the end of most levels you have to challenge one of the bosses, and at the end of the final level you should challenge four Daltons one after another again.[CR]Some levels are scrolling arcades such as stagecoach traveling, chasing a train, escaping the Tornado or Buffalo, or flowing in the rapids. Also the bonus level is present, where you should shoot all the bottles to get and extra life.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] [CR]Put in at Password Screen</plot>

		<title_clean>Lufia - The Legend Returns</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR]Lufia: The Legend Returns is a 2001 console role playing game developed by Neverland. It is the third game in the Lufia franchise, and the first to be released for th e Game Boy Color. It is the sequel to Lufia &amp; The Fortress of Doom, and Lufia II: Rise of the Sinistrals, taking place a couple hundred years ahead.[CR]Lufia: The Legend Returns contains many of the genres standards, such as random battles and leveling up. Battles are played out with up to nine of your playable characters covering a 3x3 grid. With characters on the front lines taking more damage, but dealing out an equally high amount in return. Basic set up strategy involves putting high hitting physical characters on the front lines, with more frail magic characters in the back lines receiving added defense. The majority of the game's dungeons are randomly generated upon entering them.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The story of Lufia: The Legend Returns takes place in a fictional world divided into 4 continents. Throughout the course of the story, the party will venture to the various locales of these continents to battle the Sinistrals, enemies returning from the first two games in the franchise. The introduction covers the events of the Doom Island Wars, the central conflict in the previous two games, and the story of the hero Maxim, who defeated the four sinistrals to end the war.[CR]The player takes direct control of the teen aged swordsman Wain, a descendant of Maxim. When the Tower of Death causes an eruption of flames in Wain's hometown, he is introduced as Seena, a young woman posing as a fortune teller. She explains to Wain how he must venture to the towers and stop the sinistrals there from regaining their strength.[CR]Throughout the journey, Wain's party grows as they travel the land defeating the sinistrals. After defeating Daos, the third sinistral, Wain learns that the sinistrals will come back even stronger unless slayed by the legendary Dual Blade. The party retrieves it from the sunken Doom Island and proceeds to defeat Guard Daos, the form of the three sinistrals combined. After the battle, in a plot twist, Seena revelas that she is actually Erim, the fourth sinistral. Seena used Wain to defeat the sinistrals so she could be the only sinistral, and ruler of the world. Transforming into Zalbak after being defeated, Seena raises Doom Island from the depths of the ocean.[CR]It is within Doom Island that Wain defeats Zalbak. With her dying breath Seena explains that she had to lie to Wain so he would kill her, thus ending the rule of terror of the sinistrals. She claims that one day they will meet again, and dies. In the game's epilogue, Wain meets Seena again in his home town, with Seena appearing to have forgotten the monster she once was.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Wain: The protagonist, and descendant of the legendary Maxim.[CR]Seena: A young woman posing as a fortune teller, is actually Erim.[CR]Dei: A Thief who steals from the rich.[CR]Aima: A skilled monk who joins Wain after her master is killed by the sinistrals.[CR]Melphis: A princess rescued by Wain's group.[CR]Randolph: Melphis' vassal.[CR]Mousse: A capsule monster found by the group. Acts freely in battle, uncontrollable by the player.[CR]Deckard: A legendary pirate, actually Melphis' brother, and a prince.[CR]Ruby: A beautiful gambler.[CR]Yurist: A poet who joins the group after the sinistrals slay his closest friend.[CR]Isaac: A master inventor who creates an airship for the party.[CR]Milka: An elf who witnessed the Doom Island Wars.[CR]Egg Dragon: A secret character obtainable by the player.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Beat the Egg Dragon easily[CR]Use any healing item or spell on the Egg Dragon, (preferably a potion) and its HP will become the amount you healed it for.  Then finish him off with your next attack.  The Egg Dragon allows you to fight it as much as you want, so you can keep fighting to gain massive EXP, LP, and Gold.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Start Over mode[CR]After finishing the game you can start a new game in Start Over mode. This mode quadruples the amount of EXP, LP and Gold received.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] 100,000 Gold From Fugo[CR]After defeating Erim, Daos, Amon, and Gades in the Tower of Twilight, head for Albano BEFORE you defeat Zalbak. Speak to Fugo in the 2nd floor of his mansion and he will give you 100,000 Gold. You can do this mutiple times, just keep talking to him.</plot>

		<plot>The first entry in the long-running Madden football series on the Game Boy Color is also the first entry in the series on a handheld in three years. The versions on consoles and computers having migrated to 3D graphics, the GBC edition uses traditional sprite-based 2D with a top-down view of the playing field.[CR]Game modes include Exhibition matches, Sudden Death games (first team to score wins), Full Seasons and Playoffs. Progress can be saved through use of passwords. Game features include many known from other iterations of the series, such as player injuries and substitutions, audibles, detailed statistics, control of weather and game time, and more. The playbook not only includes a wide number of standard plays, but also a variety of trick plays like fake field goals and reverse plays.[CR]Team and player names and statistics are from the 1999 NFL season.</plot>

		<plot>The first mobile entry in the series to be published by Electronic Arts proper instead of THQ, Madden NFL 2001 is the second iteration on the Game Boy Color, from new developer 3d6 Games.[CR]The game modes are Exhibition, Season and Playoffs, and for the first time, the game also offers a two-player mode over the link cable. The 2D top-down graphics have been improved compared to earlier versions, and the game offers quarterback speech for the first time on a mobile platform.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] features are as usual: a large playbook, audibles, player injuries and substitutions, and detailed statistics. The game features the player stats and team names and logos from the 2000 NFL season.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Get a sack on almost every passing play[CR]When on defense, look at where the tight end lines up. Take control of the defensive end that is above the tight end and move him to the other side of the defensive line. When the ball is snapped, you'll have a clear path to the quarterback as one offensive tackle cannot block two defensive ends, while the guard on that side won't usually be fast enough to assist. One could easily accumulate well over 100 sacks or more through an entire season via this cheap AI exploit.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Get a sack on almost every passing play[CR]If there are no tight ends on offense, simply do this trick with whichever defensive end is faster. The only exception to this trick is when the offense lines up with two tight ends, though the sacks you'll accumulate will easily cancel out the rare times that the offense decides to use a formation able to stop the glitch.</plot>

		<title_clean>Magical Drop</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR]Magical Drop's gameplay is similar to that of other puzzle games. A stack of random colored bubbles descend, the players "clown" can then attempt to arrange in stacks of three, which will cause them to be destroyed. Chains may be formed in typical puzzle game fashion either with a single drop, or by multiple drops in quick succession. The game is always played against either another human player, or a computer controlled player. Chain reactions cause your opponents stack to descend at a faster rate.  In Magical Drop 1, chains are very difficult to perform as the window of time to chain additional drops after you pop a set is very small; this was changed in the minor arcade revision "Magical Drop 1 Plus".  The original Magical Drop was released under the name "Chain Reaction" in the United States, and for whatever reason the drops (based on the 4 suits of tarot, the cups, the coins, the swords, and the wands) were replaced with various candies and snack foods. It has 6 playable characters:   Fool  MagicianHigh Priestess Star Devil Chariot   Mitchell.      World was an unplayable boss at the time. As an additional note, most of the characters were re-designed and re-named for the home releases; as an example, the Chariot has been re-named "Mitchell" and given a "butt-chin" in the playstation version, while devil looks much the same, but has been re-named "Warilin". The game has been re-released, and redone on numerous platforms. The most recent of which being the iPhone.[CR]</plot>

		<title_clean>Marble Madness</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Originally released as a trackball arcade game from Atari Games, Marble Madness was created, designed and programmed by developer Mark Cerny. The object is to guide a marble through a maze, avoiding obstacles along the way. Marble Madness is well known for it's soundtrack and was the first arcade cabinet to include stereo sound. This was the first game to be released on Atari's System 1 hardware, which allowed arcade owners to convert a machine into another game with the changing of just a few different parts. The success of the game has led it to being ported to many systems such as the NES, Master System and the Commodore 64.Marble Madness, along with Archon and Deluxe Paint, were some of the first "killer apps" for the Amiga and greatly contributed to the system's initial appeal and sales.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]You think you can get the marble through this course? Madness!Marble Madness is played from an isometric third-person perspective. The object of the game is to maneuver a colored marble through several different courses in the constraints of a time limit. Each ends when the marble reaches an end goal (helpfully marked "GOAL"). The player's marble carried momentum and a rudimentary physics model provided most of the challenge, as it was easy to fall off the side of the narrow courses.Finishing a course adds the remaining time to the limit placed on the next course. In the original arcade release, the player used a trackball to control the movement of the marble. Later home versions changed the controls to a directional pad or other control mechanism.The marble can be destroyed by falling off the course or by simply dropping too far onto another platform. In the event that the marble is shattered in a fall, a cartoon broom will appear and sweep the broken pieces away before respawning the player's marble near by. While there was no "lives remaining" counter, each fall or death wasted valuable time. Courses were designed in a manner that made it extremely difficult to finish within the time limit if the player lost more than one or two marbles.As the game goes on, enemies and obstacles are introduced to the player to make course completion more difficult. The player will run into challenges like moving platforms, catapults, a black "enemy" marble that would attempt to ram the player off the course, and even a course that must be run uphill instead of downhill. An option is also included which allows two players to race each other down any of the courses at the same time.Races:Practice Race: The first course, shorter than the others.Beginner Race: Longer, but relatively less complicated than the later courses.Intermediate Race: Featuring moving green hills and moving pools of acid that will swallow the marble.Aeriel Race: Featuring narrower platforms.Silly Race: This is the course which must be run uphill instead of downhill.Ultimate Race: Featuring many of the obstacles from earlier in the game, making it the most difficult race of all.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Infinite Time[CR]Pause the game, and press: Up, Down, Left, Right, Select, A, B, B, A, Up, Down, Left, Right, Select, A, Start.</plot>

		<title_clean>Mario Golf</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The Game Boy Color version of Mario Golf was developed by Camelot, who also developed the Nintendo 64 version. Both games were released within the same year in 1999 and share the same golf gameplay mechanics. However, the Game Boy Color version provides a different player experience than its console counterpart by providing a single-player RPG-like campaign.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Golf Shot on Course[CR]Before the player goes into the mode where they perform the shot, the can indicate where the shot will go by moving the arrow cursor on the course. Players may also choose to use a power shot to increase the distance of their shot, or use approach shots if they are within 60 yards of the pin. Once the player is satisfied with the power and location, they move on to the phase where the golf swing is performed.[CR]Mario Golf uses a three-button power gauge scheme to determine the distance and destination of the golf shot. The first button starts the golf swing by having a white bar moving left along the gauge on the bottom of the screen. The second button places a mark along the gauge to determine the power of the shot. The farther left the marker is placed on the gauge, the longer the shot will go. The final button places the mark along the "contact zone" of the gauge. The closer the marker is to the white line and within the red line of the contact zone, the closer the shot will land at the desired location.Special Shots[CR]Power: The player is allotted six power shots to use over an 18-hole golf course. Power shots can be retained by attaining a "nice shot", where the markers for distance toward the far left of the gauge and accuracy on the middle of the contact zone are perfectly marked. If the player fails to perfectly mark either the distance or accuracy portion of the swing, the power shot is used up.[CR]Approach: The shot is available when the ball is within 60 yards of the pin. The player can choose between a 30-yard and a 60-yard approach shot.Spins[CR]During the three-button phase of the golf swing, the player can add spin to their shot by holding the directional pad over the entire swing process.Up: Topspin. The ball will roll forward as it lands.Down: Backspin. The ball will roll backwards as it lands.Left/Right: Curve. The shot will curve once it is struck. Holding the pad left will have the shot start left, then curve right, vice versa for holding the pad right.Golf Shot on Green[CR]Likewise, the player can locate where they want to aim the putt and determine which power range to use before they head to the swing portion. The game displays arrows of differing sizes and directions to indicate the severity of the slope on the green.[CR]Two buttons are used to determine the distance of the putt. The first button starts the swing. The second button places a mark on the gauge to determine the power of the putt. The farther left the mark is placed on the gauge, the farther the putt will go.[CR]Main Character Creation[CR]Mario Golf offers a couple of options for the player to create their character to use for all the playable modes in the game. Three slots are available for the player to create different main characters.[CR]First Selection - Gender: Male or Female[CR]Second Selection - Age: Young Golfer or Adult Golfer[CR]Third Selection - Hand Preference: Right-Handed or Left-HandedMain Character Attributes[CR]All main characters have four attributes that the player can improve upon when they accumulate enough experience points to reach the next level. The player can select one attribute to improve upon once they pass a level. However, at each level, whichever attribute that is not selected has that attribute deteriorate in quality.[CR]Drive - The 1W normal power distance for the MC.Improvement: The MC's 1W drive improves 2-3 yards.[CR]Height - The height of the MC's golf shot. Ranges from mid-lo (best) to mid-high (worst).Improvement: The MC's height is decreased toward mid-lo.Decrease: The MC's height in increased, causing it to be more affected by strong wings.[CR]Shot - The player's golf shot style. Ranges from straight (best) to extreme fade or draw (worst).Improvement: The MC's shot is less extreme in fade or draw, the best being a straight shot as the player can easily aim where to target their shot on course.Decrease: The MC's shot is more fade or draw, where the shot starts off to the left in a fade, or right in a draw, then curves back. However, the fade or draw shot can be affected by crosswinds, causing the shot to land elsewhere than the intended destination.[CR]Meet Area and Control - The MC's "contact zone" during the three-button phase of the golf swing. Ranges from wide and good (best) to narrow and poor (worst).Improvement: The MC's contact zone is widened and their shot control is improved. The increased contact zone allows the player to still shoot a good shot if they don't hit the center mark of the zone.Decrease: The MC's contact zone is narrowed and their shot control gets worse. The narrowed contact zone increases the player's likelihood to hit a poor shot if they miss hitting the final portion of the swing in the zone.[CR]World Map[CR]The main campaign of Mario Golf features a world map that includes all four clubhouses and Peach's Castle once the player unlocks that location, along with other locales that provide special shot challenges for the player to partake. Each clubhouse has a driving, approach, and putting ranges that contain gameplay tips and contests. Completing tips, challenges, and winning contests earns experience points for the MC.[CR]Other Playable Golfers[CR]All other playable golfers can only play stroke and practice game modes.[CR]Mario and Luigi are available to play from the start.[CR]Luigi - 220 Yards, Fade[CR]Mario - Peach's Castle Champion; 270 Yards, Draw[CR]The club champions and Wario can be unlocked by defeating them in a match game.[CR]Putts - Marion Club Champion; 200 Yards, Draw[CR]Grace - Palm Club Champion; 220 Yards, Straight[CR]Tiny - Dune Club Champion; 250 Yards, Draw[CR]Gene Yuss - Links Club Champion; 240 Yards, Fade[CR]Wario - 250 Yards, Fade[CR]Golf Courses[CR]Marion Club - The main character's home club and serves as the game's beginner's golf course.[CR]Palm Club - A golf course set in a tropical setting.[CR]Dune Club - A golf course set in a desert.[CR]Links Club - A seaside course with heaths and bunker traps on the fairways that pose a challenge to golfers. The club's symbol is the Legend of Zelda triforce.[CR]Peach's Castle - This course is unlocked when the player wins the four club tournaments. A number of holes depicts a recognizable Nintendo figure.[CR]Golf Guru's Pitch and Putt Course - An all par-three 18-hole golf course. This course is unlocked when the player successfully completes the golf guru's mini-game challenge.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Change your shot[CR]To change your shot from a draw to a fade OR a fade to a draw, first complete Windy Valley Hole 1. Then win the Dune Club Tournament, and return and complete Windy Valley Hole 2. After doing so, the man will offer to change your shot. Even if you reply 'no', you can return and change it anytime. Note - He can only change your shot once, so your change will be permanent.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Change your shot[CR]Press and hold Select as you choose your player and keep it held down until you reach the hole to play. When you get to the hole you should see that your player is left handed. This only works with Mario, Wario, Luigi or Club Champs.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Change your shot[CR]If you are in a tournament or battling a club champ and you totally messed up on a hole, you don't have to get the ball in the hole and get a bogey or double bogey! All you have to do is hit Start, go to Save and Quit, then when it asks you if you want to save say yes. Go back to 1p Play and choose your character, you will be back at the beginning of the hole.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Change your shot[CR]At the Title Screen, press anywhere on the D-pad, and the Mario Golf Logo with wriggle in a circle!</plot>

		<plot>Mario Tennis for the Game Boy Color is a much different experience than its N64 effort. In addition to the core gameplay found in the N64 version, the GBC version features an RPG-style world that allows you to work your way up through the ranks at the Royal Tennis Academy.[CR]The main mode, Mario Tour, has you starting off as a Rookie with low stats. By completing training programs and defeating other students, you're able to gain experience points, which allow you to boost your tennis stats. When you're not playing tennis, you can spend time wandering the Academy grounds: talking to other students, or just taking in the sights and sounds.[CR]In addition to the main game, there's also an exhibition mode (singles or doubles) for quick-play. And, if you get tired of playing the computer, the game supports the Game Link Cable for play against a friend.</plot>

		<title_clean>Mat Hoffman's Pro BMX</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Mat Hoffman's Pro BMX was released in May 2001 and was the first and most successful spin-off of the "Pro" franchise, even advertising the use of the Tony Hawk game engine on its cover. The game is a BMX-centered extreme sports game and follows the same basic principles of the first three Tony Hawk games. Players ride around levels preforming tricks and trying to accomplish as many goals as possible in a two minute time span. Goals are similar to those found in the Tony Hawk games, and include trying to earn two different set point scores, riding through five different objects, collecting letters to spell TRICK (as opposed to SKATE) and locating a Secret Cover (as opposed to a Secret Tape).[CR]Also similar to the Tony Hawk games, every two/three levels, players must compete in a timed contest runs. Players are judged and awarded medals based on their points scored throughout the three rounds. The game includes many features that were introduced in Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 and 2. THPS1 Levels 'Warehouse' and 'Burnside' are unlockable levels that can be played in the game's Free-Ride mode. Also featured is the Create-a-Park feature included in THPS2, containing many of the pieces found within its sister creator. Tony Hawk is even a playable character, unlocked after completing the game 100% with a character.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]The game features a number of recognizable BMX riders at the time.Initial CharactersMat HoffmanMike EscamillaCory NaztazioJoe "Butcher" KowalskiRick ThorneDennis McCoyKevin RobinsonSimon TabronUnlockable CharactersGranny (Unlocked by Restarting a level 10 - 20 times).Tony Hawk (Unlocked by completing a Career mode 100% with any character)[CR][B]Levels:[/B][CR]Hoffman Bike Factory[CR]Construction Yard[CR]London Underground[CR]New York Park[CR]Treatment Plant[CR]La Harba, California[CR]CFI Competition[CR][B]Soundtrack:[/B][CR]20 Minute Crash - "The CFB Song)Agent Orange - "Everything Turns Gray"Apocalypse Hoboken - "Congested"Bad Brains - "Banned in DC"B-52s - "52 Girls"Deltron 3030 - "Positive Contact"Face to Face - "Icons"Fila Brazilia - "Bugs Bite Back"Fluke - "Absurd (Might Dub Katz Mix)Jurassic 5 - "Great Expectations"Newcleus - "Computer Age (Push the Button)Outkast - "Bombs Over Baghdad"Paris - "Break the Grip of Shame"Pailhead - "I Will Refuse"Pennywise - "Wouldn't It Be Nice"Static X and Dead Presidents - "Hip Hop"Stone Roses - "Fool's Gold (Grooverider Mix)Ten Foot Pole - "Racer X"[CR]A song called Wayward Child by Cloud was also used in one of the trailers, but did not appear in the game.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Medarot 2 Parts Collection is an RPG set in the Medarot universe. Like Parts Collection and Parts Collection 2 before it, 2 Parts Collection primarily exists as a way to quickly gain Medaparts to use in the main Medarot games. The game's engine is identical to Medarot 2's, except that the player receives a full set of Medaparts whenever he or she wins a Robattle.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]The player assumes the role of Ikki Tenryou who, after being abducted by aliens and receiving either Warbandit or Smilodonad, searches for pieces of the Fiyun Stone. During his journey, he'll battle many familiar friends and foes.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]As mentioned above, the game's turn-based battles are unchanged from Medarot 2. Each Medabot consists of a Medal, Head, Right Arm, Left Arm, and Feet, with the Head and Arms determining the weapons that can be used by the player. Once a weapon is chosen, the Medabot runs to the middle of the arena (at a speed based on the weapon and the Feet parts), uses the weapon, and retreats to their side of the field. The player then chooses another weapon and the process repeats. The Medabots' parts are destroyed as they take damage, and the destruction of the Head part eliminates the Medabot.[CR]2 Parts Collection consists of twenty different levels. Each level has five rooms that generally contain a single Medafighter; they also feature different types of terrain, which may help or hinder the player's Medabots. Ikki must defeat every Medafighter on that level in order to advance to the next. Occasionally, Dr. Armond will appear as a midboss that Ikki must defeat in order to clear the level.[CR]There are two types of battles: Normal and Special. In Special battles, Ikki uses a preset team, while the player can choose their own Medabots to use for Normal battles. Special battles are set up to emphasize a given Medabot's unique abilities.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Mega Man Xtreme (known in Japan as Rockman X: Cyber Mission) is a side-scrolling action platformer developed and published by Capcom for the Game Boy Color on January 11, 2001.[CR]The first of two portable entries of the Mega Man X series, Mega Man Xtreme recreates many elements from the first two titles in the franchise (including bosses, levels, and enemies). The game shares similarities with the portable entries of the original Mega Man series, including multiple sets of bosses (however, they are split into separate difficulty levels, each with their own storyline: Normal Mode for the first four, Hard Mode for the second four, and Xtreme Mode for all eight).[CR]The game is set in the year 21XX, sometime after the events of Mega Man X2. After revisiting the first highway scene from Mega Man X (in a simulated d&#233;j&#224; vu sequence), Maverick Hunter Mega Man X learns that a group of mysterious hackers (Techno, Geemel, and Zain) have infiltrated the "Mother Computer" system of the Hunter base and is spreading fake data all over the world (causing chaos). With entrance to the Mother Computer's core digitally shielded by the data of Mavericks previously defeated by X, our hero must dive into cyberspace (with the help of fellow Hunter Zero and Reploid computer genius Middy) to defeat his previous adversaries and restore the core.[CR]The game was later released as a Virtual Console title for the Nintendo 3DS in Japan on December 4, 2013, and in North America on May 1, 2014.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] How to get all the weapons[CR]At the title screen press up, down, up, select, a, b, up. You should hear a sound. That means you have all the weapons.</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Mega Man Xtreme 2 (known in Japan as Rockman X2: Soul Eraser) is a side-scrolling action platformer developed and published by Capcom for the Game Boy Color on October 30, 2001.[CR]The last of two portable entries of the Mega Man X series (and the sequel to Mega Man Xtreme), Mega Man Xtreme 2 recreates many elements from the first three titles in the franchise (including bosses, levels, and enemies). Players can now play as either Mega Man X or Zero, each with their own set of levels and bosses. The game also includes two unlockable game modes: Extreme Mode (allowing players to fight all eight bosses and close the game's plot) and Boss Attack Mode (allowing players to fight all eight bosses from either this game or Mega Man Xtreme).[CR]The game is set in the year 21XX, between Mega Man X3 and Mega Man X4. When the memory and programming of Reploids in Laguz Island are being erased (in what is called the "Erasure Incident"), Maverick Hunters Mega Man X and Zero investigate only to learn that the "DNA Souls" of Reploids are being used by "Soul Erasers" (Berkana and Gareth) to resurrect old Mavericks. Now it's up to X and Zero (along with rookie Navigator Iris) to retrieve the DNA Souls, defeat the revived Mavericks, and foil the plans of the Soul Erasers.[CR]The game was later released as a Virtual Console title for the Nintendo 3DS (in Japan only) on December 25, 2013.[CR]</plot>

		<title_clean>Metal Walker</title_clean>
		<plot>Metal Walker is a mechanical take on Pokmon, where the story takes place in the future on an island where a mysterious element called core has been discovered.  This "core" element was used to create a highly advanced race of robots called Metal Walkers that are used for both labor and protection for the people of the island.  One day, however, a gang of robots decide to rebel and end up killing a very prominent member of the island.  The player then takes control of the son, Tetsuo, with the help of Dr. Hawk and Tetsuo's Metal Walker in an attempt to hunt down the rebel robots and avenge his father's death.[CR]The gameplay is very similar to Pokmon, where the player explores various areas of the island searching for clues called Data Packets and battling other Metal Walkers or wild Walkers called Metal Busters, but instead of capturing these walkers, the player instead destroys them.  Destroying these other Walkers results both in scrap metal and items called Capsules that can be used to upgrade or "evolve" Tetsuo's Walker into a more advanced form.  Additionally, the player can take the scrap metal to the Junk Shop where they can also be turned into capsules as well.  Additionally, capsules can not only contain power-ups, but traps as well that can be used in battles.[CR]The battles are also different, whereas this one the attacks consists of rolling attacks that are angled off of the walls of arenas.  Additionally, if a player fights multiple opponents, all of the enemies will be present on the screen at one time and if they choose the right attack and angle, can result in multiple hits on multiple opponents.[CR]There are also three types of Walkers: Land, Marine, and Sky where, just like in Pokmon, susceptible to the other (ex. Land walkers have advantages over Marine walkers but are vulnerable and weaker to Sky Walker attacks).  Base camps can also be built around various areas of the island and can be used for restoring the health of the players Walker.[CR]As the player progresses farther into the game, they will encounter over 100 different Walkers, each with their own strengths and weaknesses as well as bosses that have to be defeated in order to access more areas of the island.  Players can also use the Link Cable to both battle their Metal Walkers or even exchange their base camps.</plot>

		<plot>Everyone in Mickey's home town was getting prepared for a big carnival!  Professor Ludwig Von Drake had just finished all the carnival floats and was showing them to Mickey, Minnie, and all their friends.  However, spying from his creepy mansion on the outskirts of town was Big Bad Pete, furious at the group enjoying themselves.  Soon, he'd gathered his cronies and raced into town, swiping all the floats and decorations.  All that was left was a letter challenging them to a race to get their things back.[CR]Mickey's Racing Adventure is an adventure game that centers around isometric racing challenges in various worlds.  It's possible to play as Mickey and his friends, as they explore various parts of Mickey's town, earning money for car upgrades and finding train tokens to travel to different worlds and challenge Pete and his henchmen to various races.  For a fee, Magica de Spell will also conjure up spells for you to use in races and get an edge on your opponents.[CR]The first time you travel to a new world via the train, Casey Jr., you must play a special train mini-game.  Pete has muddled the tracks leading to the worlds, and you must guide Casey Jr. by shifting the track tiles around so that he doesn't hit any dead-ends.  There are also TNT detonators that you must set off by running into them before you can guide Casey Jr. to the exit.[CR]The game also allows you to play as Pluto - while he can't race himself, he can sniff around town and dig for secrets.  He'll also find hidden tunnels which let you play a Digger-like mini-game where you must either collect all the bones underground, or defeat the other dogs in the area by dropping rocks on them.  After completing the objective, Pluto must then head to the exit.[CR]Mickey's Racing Adventure also supports the Game Boy Color's Infra-Red feature by allowing you to send e-mail to your friends via the Infrared Communications port.  Once you unlock the Print Shop, you can also use the Game Boy Printer to print out assorted Disney stickers.</plot>

		<plot>The Weasels have kidnapped Mickey Mouse's dog!  All that was left was a ransom note with a picture of Pluto being hauled away in a van, and some scrawled writing taunting Mickey to try and catch them.  Not knowing what else to do, Mickey called up his friends, who all volunteered to help - even Big Bad Pete plans to race!  You'll have to speed across the country to catch up with the weasels and rescue Pluto![CR]Mickey's Speedway USA is an isometric racing game that uses the same engine as Mickey's Racing Adventure.  Players can choose from Mickey, Minnie, Donald, Daisy, Goofy or Pete (and some secret characters too) as they race around various famous cities and landmarks from the United States, including Los Angeles, the Grand Canyon, San Francisco, Montana, and Yellowstone, just to name a few.[CR]The Adventure Mode of the game plays out Grand Prix style.  You must complete four races in each world, and at the end of each race, you're given points based on your placing.  The player with the most points at the end of the four races wins the trophy for that circuit.  There are assorted power-ups that help you as you race, including the Baseball Chucker (a projectile), the Magno Flyer (a homing missile), the Carbo Spritzer (a turbo), and the Paint Splotcher (an oil slick).[CR]There is also a Time Trial mode which lets you race any track that you've previously unlocked - while you can use it to practice tracks, the goal is to race fast enough to beat the track's lap time and earn a gold star in every race.  Another mode is Professor Von Drake's 'Driving School'.  In this mode, you must complete specific tasks given to you, such as parking, reverse parking and slalom driving.  The faster you perform these tasks, the better ranking you will receive (again, with a gold star as your ultimate goal).  However, you will receive a time penalty if you hit a cone or wall, or miss your parking spot, so accuracy counts as well.[CR]Mickey's Speedway USA supports many of the Game Boy Color's functions - you can play a two-player link cable race, transfer data from Mickey's Racing Adventure via the IR Link to unlock a secret, and connect to the Nintendo 64 version of Mickey's Speedway USA using the Transfer Pak.  As you progress through the game, you'll unlock many postcards and pictures for your album, which can be printed out via the Game Boy Printer.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Tour Album Pictures[CR]There is a total of 28 pictures you can unlock in the "tour album" in the extras menu.</plot>

		<plot>Micro Maniacs Racing is a racing game in the Micro Machines series. This time however, you don't get to race cars, boats or any other type of vehicle, but micro men. Most courses are on foot, but others allow you to take small vehicles such as jet skis and skate boards.[CR]The game offers a variety of micro men to play with, ranging from mutants, cyborgs, mad professors, experiments gone wrong, and other strange characters. They all have their own special weapon to give them an edge in the races. There are 32 races which are organised by a mad doctor who hopes to find the ultimate soldier among these micro maniacs.[CR]The Game Boy Color version is completely in 2D. In good Micro Machines tradition, the races are all held in and around the house, including the garage, living room, bathroom, study and deck.</plot>

		<title_clean>Missile Command</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]In Missile Command you control three missile turrets and protect six cities from incoming nuclear missiles. When you lose all of your cites, then it's game over, and the game doesn't end until you lose and the inhabitants of the cities are killed. The original arcade release had you using a trackball to move a cursor around the screen, with the press of one of three buttons you could fire a missle from the appropriate missile turret. Each missile turret has 10 missiles per level, however your missiles have a wide explosion range, letting you destroy multiple incoming missiles with one blast. The game has a set number of incoming missiles per level, and as you go up in level, the number of incoming missiles increases, therefore increasing the difficulty. The overall goal of the game, like many games from the 70's and 80's is to get the highest  High Score.[CR] Bugs &amp; Glitches[CR]The original version has a bug that happens once you get to 810,000 points. You get awarded with 150 extra cities, making it possible to play the game for several more hours.Strategies[CR]After getting up to the 255th and 256th stages (known as the 0x stages) the scoring increases by 256 times, but the speed of the missiles also becomes accelerated. Expert players have been known to score over 1 million points, enabling some players to reach up to 2,800,000 points. The scoring system was primitive enough at the time where it would only show six-digits, so their 2,800,000 showed up as 800,000. After getting past the 256th stage, the game reverts back to the original speed from stage 1, but keeps your point total and your extra cities, making it possible to keep playing the game in a giant loop. [CR]Remakes[CR]Missile Command was originally released in  arcades in 1980 and ported to the  Atari 2600, from there it was made on the  Atari 5200 and the  Atari 8-bit, as well as other consoles. The game became so incredibly popular, that over the years it has been remade by various companies under different names, and sometimes even slightly different graphics. A few examples of these are  Commando Raid,  Lunar Command, and  Condition Red.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>Tie-in of Brian De Palma's popular movie "Mission: Impossible", a side-scrolling action/adventure. Playing the secret agent Ethan Hunt, the player has to fight international terrorists. Assisted by his IMF team, he sneaks into enemy bases, blows up ammunition depots, retrieves stolen information and takes out the terrorists, using high-tech gadgets and weapons.[CR]The game comes with an "Agent Action Kit", a sort of organizer that uses the cartridge's battery backed-up memory to store names and addresses and send messages. This feature is totally unrelated to the game itself.</plot>

		<title_clean>Monkey Puncher</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Monkey Puncher, released in December 2000 by    Taito Corporation, follows the exploits of a young child training a monkey to fight in organized boxing matches to save their family. Players must befriend their monkey friend with food before they can begin to train it the art of boxing. A variety of training exercises are available, including: Skipping, which increases speed; Using a punchbag, which increases power; Sit-ups, which increases strength;Running, which increases stamina;Sparring, which can improve all stats;Shopping, which improves knowledge. It is possible to have more than one monkey at once. The monkey learns to skip, punch, do sit-ups and run by watching and copying the actions of the player, who performs each action through a rhythm-based mini game. After enough teaching, the monkey will begin to imitate these actions without prompting and for longer periods of time. The player can send the monkey to buy items from the store to increase its knowledge and bring rare items back to the players house. Sparring creates a match between a computer-controlled opponent and the monkey, leading to a small increase of stats.  The monkey's stats all have a maximum limit. It is possible to have your monkeys "date", which replaces your first monkey with a new, baby monkey. depending on the partner paired with the original monkey, the baby monkey's maximum stats may be higher or lower. Further, a monkey with maxed out stats will produce a baby with much higher maximum stats. [CR]Each activity within the game takes half a day, regardless of what is achieved. Every three days the player's monkey must enter an organized Monkey Boxing League fight. New monkeys are allowed a five day reprieve before being entered into their first test match in the league. If they fail this test match, they can try again in another five days. When the test matches are completed, the player is able to select from one of three different monkeys to fight, with at least one of them being stronger than yours. The stronger the opponent, the more money earned for defeating it. If the defeated monkey is at a better rank than the players monkey, the player's monkey gains a rank. Conversely, if the player loses a match against a lower ranked monkey, the player's monkey drops a rank. The player has no control over the monkey whilst fighting, but during the breaks between rounds may choose to refill either its health or stamina, as well as advising it strategies to use. Boxing matches are won by either a count or a KO. In the event of neither monkey KO'ing the other, the match is judged by the amount of health each monkey has.[CR]</plot>

The gameplay is simple, in turn, each player rolls the dice, and moves that player's token the indicated number of spaces clockwise. The players can buy properties, railroads, and utilities in an attempt to speed up the bankrupting process. If all properties of a certain color are acquired, a monopoly is gained, and houses and hotels may be built on those properties. These houses and hotels can drastically increase the money others have to give the owner of these properties, or rent. Since there is only one of each deed per game, trading with other places is pretty much vital to winning.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>Moorhen 3 ...Chicken Chase is a shooter still in the same style as the first Moohrhuhn. The player has a gun and he shoots chickens which fly over the screen. If they are far away, they give more points. After six shots the player has to reload the weapon (which gives a time penalty). The time is limited, the screen can be scrolled left and right and the ultimate goal is to improve the own highscore.[CR]In this game the only background is set at a sea. New features are more different animals to shoot, including the "Lessh?hner" which give negative points. Two new ammo types are more powerful but limited and have to be earned by shooting certain things. There are multiple hidden extras to find, e.g. ways to extend the playing time. In the PC version there is an online highscore list.[CR]https://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy-advance/moorhen-3-chicken-chase[CR]</plot>

There are also one-on-one sword fighting stages where the player uses a sword to hack away at enemies that appear one at a time and even a first-person shooting stage that resembles Lethal Enforcers.[CR]There are three different characters to choose from, Rick O'Connel, Evelyn O'Connel and Ardeth Bay that they can choose at the beginning of each stage, each with their own strengths and weaknesses and depending on which character they pick will determine which stage layout will be present (ex. Rick &amp; Evelyn's water escape stage feature different traps and enemies they must avoid).[CR]There are eleven stages total and a password feature that allows players to pick up and play at their leisure.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level Passwords[CR]Note that all passwords read clockwise starting from the topmost letter on the screen.

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The Mummy is a 2000 action horror developed by Konami. Although a tie-in to the movie, the game only follows Rick O' Connell in and around the tombs in 'The City of the Dead'; apart from one bonus level set in Cairo. Most of the game takes place in the dark, claustrophobic tomb environments of the film.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The Mummy is presented in seperate levels, however, there is a 'home world' element within the tomb that the player returns to after several levels. The player needs to collect a number of relics in the level to complete it. The gameplay is divided into three components; action, puzzle and platforming. The action is simple, traditional 3rd person shooting of the era - the player's weapons will lock-on to a range of enemies from scarabs to mummified priests with weapons. The puzzles include collecting parts, using levers in sequence and using torches to light areas and mirrors. The platforming consists of jumping onto platforms over lava and bottomless pits, climbing and sections of 2D side-scrolling of timed jumping over rolling barrels.[CR][B]Weapons:[/B][CR]The weapons have limited ammunition throughout the game. There is a lock-one system that fixes to the closest enemy. Some of the weapons can also be used as tools to solve certain puzzles. The weapons in the game are:FistsTorchMachetePistolsShotgunMachine GunDynamiteAncient Amulets[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Special Mode[CR]At the Main Menu, press Select, Up, Up, Down, Down, Left, Right, Left, Right, B, A.

		<plot>This is a 3-on-3 basketball game for the Nintendo Game Boy/Game Boy Color handheld, featuring all the teams and players from the 1999-2000 NBA season. The game is played through an isometric perspective on the arena similar to NBA Live '96 for the SNES. [CR]The game is jammed with all the goods you expect in a basketball game including real teams, players, and lots of stats. You can play an exhibition, full season, or playoffs with your favorite team, and you will be able to customize the rules of the game right down to the amount of time per game played. Although you only have 6 players on the court at any time, all of the usual plays and move are available, and you can sub at any time. There is also a create-a-player mode for you to put your name in the game, and you can trade for any player you like.[CR]2 player support is also included.</plot>

		<plot>[CR]NFL Blitz is a port of the successful NFL Blitz arcade machines from Midway.The game features an extremely simplified interface, and gameplay to match. Rather an a simulation, Blitz is an extremely exaggerated version of football, with humongous players that can run extremely fast and deliver hits that send players flying tens of yards. Since all of the players have nearly superhuman abilities, the downs are done on a 30-yard basis instead of 10 yards. Plays are very limited with the simplified interface, and all kicks in the game are done automatically.The traditional rules of football do not exist in Blitz, so as to not slow down play. Pass interference, roughing the passer, and late hits are completely normal. Players also celebrated quite loudly after making hard hits or scoring. These aspects would be limited later on in the blitz series as the NFL became more strict with its license.You can keep track of your stats in NFL Blitz using a name and code, much like a fighting game. Certain names let you unlock special characters, such as Raiden.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Cheat Codes[CR]At the match-up screen enter the following codes, with the digits corresponding to Start-B-A respectivelly, followed by the direction on the D-pad.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Passwords[CR]Enter the following passwords to play as the designated teams:[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Passwords[CR]Enter the following passwords to play as the designated teams:[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Hide Cursor While Making Plays[CR]When you're on the play selection screen, you can hide the cursor so others can't see the play you choose.

The game was released on a handful of platforms, notably the first and only NFL Blitz release for the Sega Dreamcast. The game was also the first of the series to not be released in arcade-cabinet format, wherein the game has not been released since. Blitz 2001 was the last Blitz release for the original Playstation. A slightly modified version of NFL Blitz 2001 was re-released on the Nintendo 64 as "NFL Blitz: Special Edition".[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] stayed essentially the same to previous Blitz releases. The same animations, mechanics, and A.I. tendencies were carried over from Blitz 2000. There were slight improvements to the physics engine in the Dreamcast release which are noticeable during gameplay.[CR]Dreamcast[CR]The Dreamcast release of the game saw notable improvements in almost all aspects of the game including graphic quality, sound, and visual presentation. Player photos and statistics were added to relevant plays in-game, as were higher-resolution player models. Weather effects were added to the game, a feature not seen before. The Dreamcast version also featured a wider-angle camera during gameplay, allowing the player to see more of the field for more effective offense and defense.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>EA Sport's 2000 Version of their NHL series didn't boast vast improvements over previous years.  For this year's release, Chris Pronger (then with  St. Louis Blues) graced the  North American cover and  Marcus Naslund (then with the  Vancouver Canucks) graced the  European cover.       The overall the game did somewhat drop in likeness; in the Nhl '99 (PC) the Stanley Cup is shown with the  player on  ice when you win it, in Nhl '00 (this game for PC) the Stanley Cup is not visible at all until the  awards screen appears. The organization of the game did improve lots. The Improvements could've been better though for detail and accessories. The trading is a little more realistic in this game comared to the other Nhl game that EA made in the past. For example, last years PC version rarely decline a  trade you purposed to make with the computer. This year, the computer reads it and makes a better decision on whether it's a good trade or bad trade...a bad trade will be   declined and a good trade will obviously be accepted.  Snapshot of PC's detail of NHL'00EA sports fixed up the accidentalglitches from their last make ofNHL (PC). Last NHL had a glitch that allowed you to  hit a player through the wall without braking the glass or wall. The player through the wall then would be stuck inthe stands triing to skate to thepuck.

		<plot>In 2000 Ubi Soft released two David O'Leary-licensed games. One, David O'Leary's Total Soccer 2000,  based on the PC game with the same name. The other one was a manager game, O'Leary Manager 2000.[CR]The gameplay in O'Leary Manager 2000 is not only about the management aspects of football. It's a bit similar to Sensible World of Soccer, as you can play not only as the manager but also the player. This rendered using an top-down view similar to many Amiga games from the early nineties.[CR]In total there is 240 licensed teams from the top two divisions in six European countries. As the manager you get to lay up training schedules, buy and sell players, pick the right players for the right tactics, and a lot of statistics. The game handles matches in three different ways, playing them, watching them or a text-based interface similar to Championship Manager, but with highlights shown in the top-down view. If you don't want to play through the whole season, you can play single matches against the AI or another player. The manager mode also supports multiple players.</plot>

		<plot>[CR]The Game[CR]Paperboy Arcade[CR]Paperboy was released to arcades in 1984 by Atari Games. It featured a custom bicycle handle controller that the player would use to accelerate, brake, and turn the titular Paperboy's bicycle on screen. A button would cause him to throw his paper to the left, to either deliver the paper perfectly in a mailbox or doorstep, or for more destructive purposes.[CR]There are three different courses on which you can deliver papers: Easy Street, Middle Road, and Hard Way. You score points for each paper successfully delivered to a subscriber, but also for breaking the windows or other household features of non-subscribers. Each run through the course would be a single day, with an entire game consisting of delivering Monday through Sunday. At the end of each day any subscribers that had a paper successfully delivered would give a bonus. Any subscribers missed on that day would unsubscribe for the following day. If you delivered perfectly to each house you would receive double points for each subscriber, and, unless at the max, get a formerly lost subscriber back.[CR]Each day would get progressively harder, with even Easy Street being quite challenging by Thursday or Friday. The difficulty was ramped up by adding more obstacles, making the doorsteps and mailboxes harder to get at, and increasing the speed of cross traffic on the one intersection. Each run through a particular day is the same, however, so eventually the player can memorize the various patterns.[CR]At the end of the street is the "Training Course", which is an obstacle course with targets, jumps, and static obstacles suitable for running up more points. At then end, a grandstand is filled with your cheering fans.EnemiesDanger Lurks[CR]Static obstacles, such as low brick walls, mailboxes, bushes, garbage cans, push-mowers, fences, and the houses themselves cause you to immediately fall off your bicycle, losing a life. The player is forced to be moving forward at all times, and can only turn so quickly left or right, so it is easy to get in situations where the player just cannot move to the side quickly enough to avoid them.[CR]Mobile obstacles, such as dogs, cars, drunks, men fighting, uni-cyclists, skeletons, RC cars, those evil, evil skateboarding kids, and more are a constant threat, popping up without much warning, crashing into you or forcing you into something else.Incarnations[CR]There have been many console and handheld versions of Paperboy, from the Commodore 64 and TRS-80 all the way to Xbox Live Arcade.[CR]StrategyAmazing Paperboy Delivers![CR]If you're playing to complete a full week, focus on not dying at all until at least Thursday. Get as many points as you can to build up extra lives. Don't be afraid to ride on the lawns, although if you run over any of the flowers of your subscribers, they will promptly unsubscribe.[CR]A good technique for crossing the busy intersection on Easy Street is to go forward, pause for the car rushing by, then go forward quickly.[CR]The individual days don't vary, so memorization of enemy locations is key. It gets tricky, because you're on the same course and can find yourself on Monday avoiding an enemy that doesn't show up until Friday or forgetting to avoid something on Wednesday because you thought they weren't until later in the week. Memorization and twitch reflexes are the name of the game.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] All Bikes[CR]Turn left immediately after you start moving on Easy Street, then press [B]Start, A, A, A, B, Select, A, B, Start[/B].</plot>

Once the desired direction is chosen then the power will be chosen by pressing the A button to stop the moving power meter.[CR]Perfect Choro Q also has some role-playing elements in that the player drives a car along an overworld map and has multiple destinations that can be chosen.

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Perfect Dark is a video game for the Game Boy Color developed by Rare and released in 2000. Like the Nintendo 64 game, Perfect Dark for Game Boy Color follows the exploits of secret agent Joanna Dark. In this edition, Agent Dark must complete seven huge missions that involve weapon play as well as puzzle solving. These missions revolve around the destruction of illegal cyborg manufacturing facilities. The game features full motion video cutscenes that unfold the storyline for the gamer. The game itself doesn't utilize a first-person perspective for the action -- instead, Perfect Dark GBC features a pseudo-overhead viewpoint, much like what Konami did with Metal Gear: Ghost Babel and what Rebellion did with Mission: Impossible. However, at certain points in the game you'll be placed in a through-the-eyes perspective as well. This game also has a built-in rumble feature.Perfect Dark on the Game Boy Color was set in the year leading up to the start of the N64 game, covering her final test and graduation to full service as a Carrington Institute operative and her first mission. The game was played mostly from an isometric top-down perspective but included a variety of other game types such as a vertically scrolling driving section, a first-person sniping section and a number of different boss fight stages. The game encouraged stealth over action in keeping with the N64 game.The game made use of many of the features of the hardware. A two player deathmatch mode made use of the link cable, unlockable stickers could be printed using the Game Boy printer or traded with other players via the infra-red port and the cartridge had a built-in rumble feature. If used in conjunction with the N64 Transfer Pak, the game could be used to unlock four cheat modes in N64 Perfect Dark - All Weapons, Claoking Device, Hurricane Fists and R-Tracker.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>In Phantom Zona, the player is invited to a school where solving puzzles is the most popular pastime. Upon arriving however, the player will meet Phantom Zona, who reveals that the school is actually a secret base for a gang that fights each other using riddles. When the player enters a battle, he or she is presented with a riddle, and multiple choices answers. Answering correctly will damage the opponent. Answering wrong causes damage to the player. Whoever has the least amount of damage wins. The game makes use of the Game Boy Color's infra-red port. By using anything that emits a infra-red signal, the game generates new puzzles. Players can also use the Game Boy Link cable to swap puzzles.</plot>

		<plot>At first I thought this game would be yet another boring Side Pocket ripoff.[CR]And it is, but it's different enough that you don't get bored with it.[CR]So basically you play against other people in this game, right? But to make things fun, you can put monsters inside the billiard balls so they have some sort of effect if you hit them. The problem, of course, comes when your opponent hits the balls you wanted to use and well, uses them to his or her advantage.[CR]But how do you win these monsters? By winning battles. It seems there are only twenty, but that's not the only thing you can win. You can also win different music tracks (which ain't that useful since you don't hear music during play, only while you're walking around the room), comics, shirts, and fake noses (the hell?).[CR]This game isn't for everybody, but you'll warm up to it eventually.[CR]Translation Description:[CR]So far Philip Reuben's done a really good job at translating this game. There's little space in the screen for text and it looks like it's giving him a hard time, but there are literally no errors in the text and everything looks pretty neat so far. The readme states the stuff that isn't translated, and while it is bothersome, it's not anything that will stop you from being able to enjoy this game.[CR]Reviewer: Kitsune Sniper[CR]https://www.romhacking.net/trans/857/[CR]</plot>

		<plot>Long, long ago, the sun was covered by a dark and heavy cloud. It was said this cloud was caused by a monster that had sealed the Sword of the Sun. Legends also says that to break the seal, a hero must collect five Power Stones that are guarded by monsters. Bomberman takes up the challenge as he is the last hero strong enough to defeat such monsters.[CR]This is a side-scrolling platform game. In each world, you must clear four areas by killing any monsters within. To kill a monster, you drop a bomb. After a few seconds, the bomb explodes in a four-way blast. If the monster is within range of the blast, it is killed. After you clear these four areas, you must clear a fifth area by killing a boss to clear the world and collect its Power Stone.[CR]Be careful, though, because if Bomberman is touched by a monster, touches a dangerous item or is caught in the blast of his own bomb, you lose a life. After all lives are gone, you get the option to restart that last area or quit. In most areas, you can, though the placement of bombs, find items to increase your jumping, speed, blast radius, etc.</plot>

		<plot>Travel back to the world of Johto as the Gold &amp; Silver series continues with brand-new features!Whether you're reading the fresh descriptions in your Pokedex, using the unique sort function to organize your Pok&#233;mon in new ways, watching the all-new battle animations, or discovering another way to capture Suicune, you'll need all of your Poke-skills to master Pok&#233;mon Crystal on your Game Boy Color![CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Belly Drum Error[CR]Belly Drum is a move who normally suffices to maximize the user's Attack to quadruple its normal value while simultaneously removing 50% of their current HP. Thus, the move is supposed to not function if at under 50% HP. However, you can still use Belly Drum: if you do so, the game will claim that it failed, but it actually did raise your Attack 2 stages (like x1.00 Attack to x2.00 Attack). This is because the command for Belly Drum is akin to 6 Swords Dances: however, one of the six routines is erroneously used prior to the HP deduction.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Belly Drum Error[CR]Note that this glitch involves the use of trading between Pokemon Red/Blue/Green/Yellow (R/B/G/Y) and Pokemon Gold/Silver/Crystal (G/S/C). It will easily result in a Ditto or Mew whose is Shiny, and thus automatically having above-average stats (as is the norm in Pokemon G/S/C).First, you must trade any Shiny Pokemon - a Pokemon whose color is different than normal - from Pokemon G/S/C to Pokemon R/B/G/Y. Any Shiny Pokemon will work, including the Shiny Gyarados you automatically find during gameplay. While on the latter, you need to find a Ditto in the wild: Mew will also work if you use other glitches in those games. While that battle occurs, have the Pokemon that was Shiny be in-battle until Ditto or Mew Transform into that Pokemon. Catch the Ditto or Mew thereafter.Once you do so, trade that Ditto or Mew to Pokemon G/S/C. In doing so, you'll figure out that the Pokemon was Shiny.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Belly Drum Error[CR]This is strange, but also permanent, so only do this if you want your clock to remain set on a certain day. To do this, go to Vermillion City and talk to the Machop that is stomping on the ground. After you talk to him, open your Pack, go to Coin Case, and look at how many coins you have. Your game will either freeze or reset, so you must reset if it freezes. When you do, your game clock will be frozen in that exact time unless you use another code to change the time, which is possible.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Pokedex Diploma[CR]By capturing every Pokemon in the Kanto and Johto Pokedexes - aside from Mew and Celebi, which are optional - you will be able to speak with the Game Freak director in Celadon City to obtain a diploma recognizing this achievement.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Get through grassy areas without a single random encounter.[CR]Once you've obtained the HM Cut you can use it to teach some of your pokemon the attack of the same name.[CR]This ability now cannot only be used to cut down certain trees but also to get rid of any grass so you don't have to bother with any random encounters.[CR]When saving and loading or leaving and reentering the area you used cut in, the grass will have returned.[CR]</plot>

		<title_clean>Pokemon - Gold Version</title_clean>
		<plot>Pokemon Gold takes place several years after Red, Blue and Yellow, and puts the user into a brand new world, Johto. The gameplay is very similar to the previous games, but with several improvements. These include new functions for the player's Pokegear, a Pokedex that can now be sorted by evolution type, and, of course, new Pokemon. Once again, the objective of the game is to become the champion trainer, and try to complete the Pokedex. To become the champion, the player battles Gym Leaders to obtain various badges. Completing the Pokedex requires a different set of actions, and involves capturing wild Pokemon, battling various trainers to obtain money, and trading Pokemon with NPC's and other owners of Pokemon games.[CR]https://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy-color/pokmon-gold[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Reset Game Time[CR]To reset the game time, at the title screen hold Down+Select+B. You'll need a password next, see the Time Reset FAQ on how to generate your unique password.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Battle leaders over and over again....[CR]First you save in front of a PC and then you go and battle the Gym and its leader. When you finish, go and clone the pokemon that grew levels. When you turn your game back on you will be in the Pokemon center BEFORE you battled the leader but if you look in your PC you will find the Cloned Pokemon. Exchange the pokemon and save when you have your raised ones in your party then you can do it again. [CR]Note: This trick will fill up your boxes so every three times you do this trick release the extra pokemon or switch boxes.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Battle leaders over and over again....[CR]This glitch will allow you to skip the end of the game, the "end" that is found after beating the game's boss atop Mt. Silver and obtaining all 16 Badges. Begin by obtaining a party in the early game (if possible) of your starter Pokemon, Kenya (the Spearow given by a man in a gatehouse in Goldenrod), the Togepi from the Egg in the early game or the Egg itself, and a Wooper. Teach Wooper Return and put it as its topmost move in the list. Make Wooper hold TM12 (Sweet Scent).[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Battle leaders over and over again....[CR]Next, rename Boxes 2-8 in Bill's PC, without the quotes. (Note that "@" means the accented "e" found in "Pokemon" and "#" the symbol for "male".) For Box 1, "BOX1". For Box 2, "AAAp@D95". For Box 3, "'v,'v@@72'l". For Box 4, "'v#@,2p". For Box 5, "@#2'v9@22". For Box 6, "'v8##4'v't'l". For Box 7, 'v@@@4p'l@". And for Box 8, "4@d2'd". Stand in front of the console at the bottom-left of the main Pokemon Center counter, open the Pokedex, listen to Bellsprout's cry, and use the Coin Case. Exit out of the menu and all the sprites should be invisible. Walk up the stairs to the Center's second floor and then down again to warp to Mt. Silver. Speak with the invisible Red there to automatically end the battle with him (as the game makes all battles a win when you have no Pokemon). And now the game is beaten![CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Battle leaders over and over again....[CR]Note that, after this glitch, you will have no Pokemon and no ability to catch them (as you will not be able to enter battles without instantly winning). This is rectified by obtaining a gift Pokemon, such as the Eevee from Bill in Goldenrod or the Shuckle in Cianwood.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Battle leaders over and over again....[CR]Belly Drum is a move who normally suffices to maximize the user's Attack to quadruple its normal value while simultaneously removing 50% of their current HP. Thus, the move is supposed to not function if at under 50% HP. However, you can still use Belly Drum: if you do so, the game will claim that it failed, but it actually did raise your Attack 2 stages (like x1.00 Attack to x2.00 Attack). This is because the command for Belly Drum is akin to 6 Swords Dances: however, one of the six routines is erroneously used prior to the HP deduction.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Battle leaders over and over again....[CR]This glitch allows you to copy Pokemon with the use of only one cartridge of a game. You will need six Pokemon for this, two of which are filler. In the second slot, you want the Pokemon of the desired species. In the sixth slot, you want the Pokemon of the desired nickname, gender, types, moveset, statistics, and IVs and EVs. (Thus, if the sixth Pokemon is Shiny, so shall be the resultant Pokemon.) The other four can be filler Pokemon, but be sure someone in the party can use Fly or Teleport.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Battle leaders over and over again....[CR]Begin by putting the Fly/Teleport Pokemon in the first slot of the party. Now, deposit the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth Pokemon in your party into the PC. Enter the Bug-Catching Contest on Tuesday, Thursday, or Saturday per the in-game clock and go to the front of side exits when you are in the contest. When asked to quit, say "No" and then Fly or Teleport away. Put the second Pokemon in your party into the PC. Save and reset the console and then return to the National Park. Speak with the guard at the front or side entrances and opt to quit the contest.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Battle leaders over and over again....[CR]After learning the results of the contest, you will receive a copy of the sixth Pokemon in the party, who is of the second Pokemon's species.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Battle leaders over and over again....[CR]NOTE: This requires at least two pokemon, and access to a PC. [CR]First, take the pokemon you want to duplicate, put it into your group. Make sure you have a box with at least one free slot. Save your game in front of your PC. Then, go to the box, and deposit the pokemon. Exit the box, go to ''Change Box,'' select any box, and while it's saving, turn off the Gameboy.  [CR]NOTE: Make sure that you do it while the message ''Saving, do not turn off the power'' is still there. Otherwise it will not work.  [CR]Turn on the Gameboy, the box should be the one that you deposited the pokemon in. You should have the pokemon in your group and have the same pokemon in your group. [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Battle leaders over and over again....[CR]Note that this glitch involves the use of trading between Pokemon Red/Blue/Green/Yellow (R/B/G/Y) and Pokemon Gold/Silver/Crystal (G/S/C). It will easily result in a Ditto or Mew whose is Shiny, and thus automatically having above-average stats (as is the norm in Pokemon G/S/C).First, you must trade any Shiny Pokemon - a Pokemon whose color is different than normal - from Pokemon G/S/C to Pokemon R/B/G/Y. Any Shiny Pokemon will work, including the Shiny Gyarados you automatically find during gameplay. While on the latter, you need to find a Ditto in the wild: Mew will also work if you use other glitches in those games. While that battle occurs, have the Pokemon that was Shiny be in-battle until Ditto or Mew Transform into that Pokemon. Catch the Ditto or Mew thereafter.Once you do so, trade that Ditto or Mew to Pokemon G/S/C. In doing so, you'll figure out that the Pokemon was Shiny.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Pokedex Diploma[CR]By capturing every Pokemon in the Kanto and Johto Pokedexes - aside from Mew and Celebi, which are optional - you will be able to speak with the Game Freak director in Celadon City to obtain a diploma recognizing this achievement.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Avoid random battles[CR]When you walk up to the edge of grass use cut and the grass will be gone. No more random battles.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Avoid random battles[CR]If you capture a Ditto you can use that for breeding. The Ditto will act as the female, so you wont have to get two of each type of Pokemon that you want the baby form of it. For Example just breed a Ditto and a Pikachu, and you will get a Pichu.[CR]</plot>

Get to a computer and save it, making sure that you have atleast one more room for the cloned pokemon. Deposite the poke'mon that you want to duplicate. Now change boxes, when you change you'll automatically save, so say yes when it asks you to save. When it says "Saving, don't turn off the power", turn it off then on. When you gain control, you'll be holding the regular pokemon and there will be the cloned pokemon in Bill's PC. Use this glitch at your own risk, as it is possible to corrupt save data.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Beat the Game Early (Non-JP Versions)[CR]Note that this glitch involves the use of trading between Pokemon Red/Blue/Green/Yellow (R/B/G/Y) and Pokemon Gold/Silver/Crystal (G/S/C).

To do this, go to Vermillion City and talk to the Machop that is stomping on the ground. After you talk to him, open your Pack, go to Coin Case, and look at how many coins you have. Your game will either freeze or reset, so you must reset if it freezes. When you do, your game clock will be frozen in that exact time unless you use another code to change the time, which is possible.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Beat the Game Early (Non-JP Versions)[CR]First start a new game. Then after you have selected a starter pokemon, work your way through the game, not saving at all, until you can catch pokemon. Catch any other pokemon then deposit your starter into the PC box. After that, change boxes and when it asks you to save click "yes". When it starts saving reset(or turn off) the game. When you go on your main file the starter should be in the box that it was placed in. Make sure before you do this glitch to go on your main file and move the number one pokemon in the box, as the starter will replace it. Use this glitch at your own risk, it can mess up game data.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Easy Breeding[CR]If you capture a Ditto you can use that for breeding. The Ditto will act as the female, so you wont have to get two of each type of Pokemon that you want the baby form of it. For Example just breed a Ditto and a Pikachu, and you will get a Pichu.</plot>

		<plot>The greatest Pok&#233;mon Trading Card Game players of all time - the Grand Masters - are looking for one player worthy of inheriting the four rare, Legendary Pok&#233;mon Cards!Build new decks with the Auto Deck Machine, hone your skills on the Challenge Machine and test your ability in Challenge Hall.Expand your card collection, duel your way through 8 Club Masters and earn the right to challenge the Grand Masters in the Pok&#233;mon Dome!Shadowy figures, wise instructors and powerful opnnents await in the ultimate trading card game adventure.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] See a coin flip before it happens.[CR]Coin flips are not random and happen in a pre-determined order. To exploit this, use an attack, trainer card, etc. that involves a coin flip. If the flip doesn't come up what you wanted, immediately turn off the game without leaving the screen that shows the coin. Turn the game back on and select Continue Duel. The duel will be where it was immediately before you had flipped the coin, but the outcome of the very next coin flip will always be the same as the one you just saw. This trick is extremely useful because you can keep from wasting trainer cards or attacts if you flip tails, and by skipping your turn you can even guarantee that your opponent's next flip will be tails.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] See a coin flip before it happens.[CR]Note: Do NOT try this trick on the coin flip that determines who's turn is first, as your game will NOT save.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] 60 Free Energy Cards[CR]The tech in the upper-right corner of the Mason Laboratory will give you 60 free energy cards if you dont have any energy cards (other than the ones in your deck).  If you want, you can just make your decks chock full of energy cards and then talk to the guy.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] 60 Free Energy Cards[CR]The prize cards often come in handy while in a heated battle. The only problem is they are turned face-down, so you have no clue which card you are going to pick up after you defeat an opposing card. This is the trick to break that rule:[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] 60 Free Energy Cards[CR]First, knock out the enemy's card, and when you are told to pick up a prize, choose any one you want. Remember which card you looked at, and reset your gameboy. Choose &amp;quot;Continue Duel&amp;quot; option, and you will resume right before you knocked out the enemy's card. Pick up another prize, and repeat the process until you either find a card you need, or until you know which prizes you have. This trick can really make the difference in a duel.</plot>

		<plot>In a rising pit of colored blocks, it's your task to continuously eliminate these tiles by switching two tiles' positions on the horizontal row. When three or more tiles link up in a up/down or left/right fashion, they disappear. Gravity kicks in and settles the rest of the tiles into the bin ? this can cause a chain reaction to occur since other blocks of the same color can fall into place next to each other. It's up to you to continuously work the bin to wipe out tiles by making combination connections and chain reactions. That's the game in a nutshell, but there are several modes of play that'll keep your fingers busy.

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Power Quest is set in a small town where a majority of the citizens have taken up fighting with model robots. When the game begins, the player may chose one of five model robots to battle with. The player then walks around town to find fights at areas like the playground or the school but during the fight the player's control is shifted from the character to the robot. The plot revolves around the protagonist working his way to the number one spot in a large fighting tournament.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]When walking around town the camera shows an overworld style view of the player but when a battle is initiated it becomes a standard, one-on-one 2D fighting game. Power Quest contains some weak RPG elements through which, once enough currency is accrued, the player can buy special parts with subsequent upgrades for their model robot which will enhance their fighting capabilities, though eventually the player will be able to equip every upgrade. The game also has a password system in lieu of an actual save system.[CR]Model Robots[CR]Max[CR]A basic robot model that uses punches and simple combos making him a good choice for beginners.Gong[CR]A large model that utilizes strength over speed. He deals more damage and can take more hits than the other models and is favored by most of the villains in the game.Speed[CR]The only female model in the game. As her name suggests, she utilizes speed over strength and uses mostly kicking combos.Axe[CR]The most balanced model when it comes to speed and strength, Axe is a close range fighting robot with some devastating (somewhat "cheap") attacks.Lon[CR]Like Axe, Lon has an equal balance of speed and strength but his attacks are mostly long ranged.Borot[CR]Somewhat of a joke as opposed to a true fighter, Borot looks like a regular Wall-E style robot. Borot cannot jump or block and cannot perform specials. In fact, his only attack is a simple, weak punch.[CR]</plot>

		<title_clean>Power Rangers - Lightspeed Rescue</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Power Rangers Lightspeed Rescue was developed by many different companies and published by THQ. Each version was completely different and offered many different play styles.[CR]Playstation Version[CR]The Pink Ranger drop kicks an enemy in the PSX version.[CR]The Playstation version was developed by Climax and published by THQ. It was released October 30, 2000.[CR]It's a standard top down 3D beat em' up where the player can play as all 5 Rangers and, once unlocked, the Titanium Ranger. Each Ranger has his or her own special attack along with the standard assortment of punches and kicks. Not much can be said about the gameplay except the Rangers fight their way to the end of the level and beat a boss. This version of the game can be played co-op.[CR]N64 Version[CR]The N64 version was developed by Mass Media and was also published by THQ. It was released September 28, 2000.Top down shooting level.[CR]This version was wildly different from the Playstation version. Instead of it being a top down beat em' up it had four different gameplay types that play like minigames. One type is a top down shooter where a Power Ranger is the playable character, the A button is used to shoot forward and the B button to shoot behind. The player moves around the area collecting coins or saving hostages. The second gameplay type is a 3D sidescrolling mode where the player controls a car. The goal is either to shoot water to put out flaming cars or run over toxic waste to clean it up. The third type is a semi mech game where the player is inside the Lightspeed Megazord and must defeat the enemies on screen. The final game type is sort of a flying game. All that is done is flying around in a hovercraft and collecting boxes. These four gameplay types repeat for 30 levels until the game is eventually completed.[CR]GameBoy Color Version[CR]The GameBoy Color version was developed by Natsume and published by THQ. It was released July 30, 2000.[CR]The player goes around saving trapped citizens from peril. The player has to collect items to open doors and stopping fires. It plays out very much like a puzzle game. There are also playable big Megazord battles.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level Password[CR]Enter it on a password screen.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level Password[CR]These passwords are on easy mode:[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level Password[CR]These passwords are on easy mode:[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level Password[CR]These passwords are on easy mode.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level Password[CR]These are for the hard mode.</plot>

		<title_clean>Prince of Persia</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Prince of Persia 1989[CR]Prince of Persia was originally released in 1989 for the  Apple II by  Jordan Mechner. Mechner used film of his younger brother David running, jumping, and performing many of the Prince's actions. Mechner then  rotoscoped the film to create the animations that give the  Prince his fluid movement.[CR]Part of the game's appeal was its then unique focus on  environmental puzzle-solving, as well as its one-on-one  sword duels. Mechner has stated that the game was inspired by the first ten minutes of Raiders of the Lost Ark, for the character's  acrobatics in a  dangerous environment.[CR]Prince of Persia has since been ported to a number of different platforms, including the  Amiga,  Apple Macintosh, DOS,  NES,  Game Boy,  Sega Genesis,  Game Gear,  SNES,  Sharp X68000,  Atari ST, and SAM Coup&#233;.[CR]The music was written by Jordan Mechner's father,  Francis Mechner.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Prince of Persia is a platformer with heavy emphasis on careful jumping and environmental puzzle solving. The player controls the Prince as he attempts to  rescue his princess before she  weds  Jaffar, the evil Grand Vizier. Jaffar has trapped the  Princess, and given her an hour to decide whether she wishes to marry him or die. This hour unfolds in  real time, and the only way to lose the game is to fail to reach the Princess within sixty minutes.[CR]The player is given only an hour to navigate the game's thirteen levels and rescue her. Scattered throughout each level are hidden  switches, secret  pitfalls and a variety of other hazards standing in the Prince's way of rescuing his beloved. There are also hidden  potions that have a variety of effects on the Prince.[CR]The player will have to explore and pay attention to their environment in order to solve the puzzles and make it to the end. The Prince will also have to fight his way past  guards to reach the Princess. Combat exists as a series of sword fights, which were unusual for its time when  projectile weapons were the norm.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]The Sultan of Persia, one day, leaves to wage war in a foreign land. His Grand Vizier, Jaffar, steps in to take his  throne while he is away. Shortly thereafter, a street urchin decides to climb the Royal Tower to see the Princess, whom people have claimed to be as beautiful as a new moon. When the young  orphan finally sees the Princess,  they fall in love. The couple intend to marry.[CR]The Vizier discovers this and decides that he wants to marry the Princess. He throws the street urchin into the lowest  dungeon and locks the Princess in the highest tower. He then gives the Princess one hour, counted on a magical  hourglass, in which she has to decide to marry the Vizier or die.[CR]The street urchin's main goal is to defeat Jaffar and reach the Princess.[CR][B]Legacy:[/B][CR]The SNES version[CR]Aside from being ported to several different platforms, Prince of Persia has received  two  proper  sequels and a  3D remake.  Ubisoft re-imagined the series with its  Sands of Time  trilogy, and the French publisher again rebooted the series with a new game, titled simply  Prince of Persia. A motion picture based on  Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time is also being developed, Mike Newell directing, and is being produced by  Jerry Bruckheimer. The movie was released in 2010 starring Jake Gyllenhaal, Gemma Arterton, and  Ben Kingsley and was received with average reviews.[CR]The game was  ported many times, and version such as the  SNES one which improved on the original. In the SNES game, the graphics were updated, and the game was given 20 levels, and an extra hour to complete the game.[CR]The original Prince of Persia has sold over 2 million copies.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]When the Game Gear version was released Electronic Gaming Monthly issued the scores of 8,8,7,5 adding, "...very impressed with this version of the game. Not only were all the characters and pitfalls very easy to see on the small screen, but even the very fluid animation found on the other versions of the game was duplicated almost perfectly".[CR]</plot>

		<plot>Disguised behind a 50's style B-movie background story about an evil professor (trying to take over the world, of course) who turns the hero (you) into a shapeless 'blob', is an increasingly complex strategic puzzle game with a variety of different targets. Typical Mission goals would be centered around clearing the screen of all elements, but hitting certain targets on the way and making sure that there is still a route to the exit. If the player reaches the exit with all mission objectives complete, the next level is introduced by a password. Playtime per level is up to 20 minutes and there are 150 levels. The first 20 or so levels introduce all game elements one by one.[CR]There are various extras, allowing to manipulate puzzle pieces, remove blocked routes and so on, as well as special blocks such as teleporters (beaming you around the playfield), or ice (making direction changes impossible) etc.[CR]The basic principle is like memory, i.e. two equal looking puzzle pieces need to be found and are then taken of the playfield. To do that the player can 'clone' the blob, and send his alter ego to connect the blocks occupied by the main character and the clone.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Easy Level Passwords[CR]To get to any level from 1 to 150, just enter ELXXX, where XXX is the number of the level.  EL001 will take you to Level 1, EL150 will take you to Level 150, EL151-EL999 will show the ending.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Easy Level Passwords[CR]From the Main Menu, choose Enter Password and input one of the following:</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Rainbow Islands is the official sequel to Taito's Bubble Bobble, once again featuring Bub and Bob (a.k.a. Bubblun and Bobblun), who returned to their original human forms at the end of Bubble Bobble. This time they are charged with rescuing the titular Rainbow Islands from an entity named Dark Shadow.[CR]The game was originally released as an Arcade title in 1987 but has been ported to several home computer systems including the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64 and later the Amiga and Atari ST. Several other iterations have also been released on the early 8 and 16 bit consoles.[CR]A platforming game at its core, there are ten islands to beat (dependent on the platform), each one with a different theme that become progressively more difficult.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The aim of the game is to scale to the top of each level. Using the main characters' ability to cast Rainbows, the player can use these as platforms to advance up the level. The Rainbows can also be used as a weapon to defeat enemies by trapping them under the Rainbow and then jumping onto it, breaking it and killing the enemy in the process. The added pressure of each level sinking into the sea means the player has to work their way through the level as quickly as possible.[CR]If a rainbow kills an enemy after it has been fired, rather than killing an enemy by collision as the rainbow is fired, it causes the enemy to spawn a diamond. By collecting all 7 diamonds (one of each color of the rainbow) an extra life is gained. In addition a giant diamond will spawn upon defeating the boss at the end of a stage.[CR]Collecting all of the giant diamonds results in having 3 extra islands to play in some releases of the game.[CR][B]Music:[/B][CR]The arcade release soundtrack sounded very similar to the song "(Somewhere) Over The Rainbow" from the TV musical "The Wizard Of Oz". This soundtrack made it into the Japanese versions of the Famicon and Genesis releases as well as the European and US releases on Commodore 64, Amiga, Atari ST, ZX Spectrum and Amstrad)[CR]In later releases, such as the Sega Master System, NES and Playstation, the music was changed subtly to prevent any copyright infringement.[CR]Ports[CR]Rainbow Islands was originally an arcade release but has been ported to several home consoles and computers, Including The Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum and Amstrad in 1989 by Ocean Interactive. The Amiga and Atari ST versions were also ported by Ocean Interactive in 1990. Taito converted the game to the Genesis in 1990, the NES in 1988 and the Sega Master System in 1993.[CR]The Sega Master System version suffers from a glitch making it impossible to reach the 8th Island and thus impossible to complete the game.[CR]The Famicom/NES version in Japan and US had original levels and graphics and differs greatly from the more faithful European port.[CR]Later releases with upgraded visuals were released in 1996 for the Playstation, PC and Sega Saturn.[CR]It appeared on Xbox Live Arcade in 2009, again with newer upgraded visuals.[CR]Power Ups[CR]As well as featuring the characters from Bubble Bobble, the game also shares many of the collectibles from the game, such as:Red Shoes: Increase player speedRed Potion: Increase rainbow speedRed Potion: Adds a rainbow (maximum 3)Crystal Ball: Enemies become characters from Bubble Bobble when they die[CR]Other items from Bubble Bobble that are only for points include: Rings, Bracelets, Colored Lamps, Canes, Colored Bottles and diamonds.[CR]Other items off different rarity also appear throughout the game such as the Book, Rainbow Necklace, Clock and Blue Goblet.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Unlock The Endings[CR]There are 3 endings depending on the following:[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Unlock The Endings[CR]In each island, collect 7 small Gems of each color and after beating the boss of the island, you'll get the big Gem. Do the same thing on each island to get the 7 big Gems. Once you beat the boss of the 7th island, instead of getting the bad ending, you'll proceed to 4 more islands.</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B] [CR]Rampage World Tour is the sequel to the classic NES and arcade game Rampage. Rampage World Tour was released in 1997 on the Sega Saturn and Sony PlayStation, and the PC, with poor reviews, but good sales. Later on, the game was ported to various consoles including the Nintendo 64, Game Boy Color, and even has a downloadable version available on the PS3's PlayStation Network.  [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR] Poor civilians, don't know whats going to happen...The game has you choosing between three different monsters. George is an ape-like monster that resembles King Kong, Lizzie is a lizard, and Ralph is a werewolf. All of these monsters were once humans who were mutated during experiments at a company called "Scum Labs." To get revenge against "Scum Labs," you need to travel through various cities, destroying planes, tanks, helicopters, and buildings to advance. You must also destroy the "Scum Labs" building that is at the end of each level. The gameplay consists of players climbing up and down buildings, destroying each level until they collapse. Along the way, various enemies try to stop you, including tanks, helicopters, soldiers, and police cars. They will throw grenades, shoot missiles, tank shells, and bullets at you, to try and turn you back to your human form. After taking enough damage from either enemies, or falling off buildings, you will revert back to a small human, and run off to the left of the screen while covering their naked bodies with their hands. The game also added 2 player co-op where players can team up with a friend, to wreak havoc with two monsters. This is George, he is angry, he is an ape.Some of the improvements from the original include semi-3D backgrounds, as well as power ups for your characters. One of the main power ups is eating a toxic waste can, which turns your character into a flying monster, until the level ends.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Play as Tiny[CR]Enter the following code immediately after dieing to play as Tiny.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Two Player Game Link Option[CR]On the main menu, hold select and tap Up, Down, Left, Right, Down, Up to unlock the two player game link option.</plot>

		<plot>While technology may improve graphics and sound, some things never change. Rampage 2: Universal Tour is very much in tune with its history, barely deviating from the original city-stomping arcade game appearing in the 1980s. Like its predecessor, Rampage World Tour, Rampage 2 retains the original 2D worlds, but improves the graphics, completely re-rendering the characters. The premise remains the same: stomp out cities and wreck things in general. Some new features in Rampage 2 include four new characters (in addition to the original three), new attacks and combos, a power meter, and bonus rounds. The cart allows up to three people can play at once and there are plenty of new cities to destroy.</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Rampart is a strategy/puzzle/action game in which the player alternately builds fortifications and then destroys invading enemy forces with the artillery within those fortifications. After which, the player then has to rebuild their damaged walls and add even more defensive means for the stronger enemy rounds to come. Created by Atari for the Arcades, the game would later see many home releases on a plethora of platforms.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The player controls a handful of castles which must be defended and repaired all within a brisk time-limit. Ships will attack the fortress typically with cannon-fire, and the player must retaliate with their own arsenal, doing their best to protect the castle. They can build walls around their castles to absorb damage, but the player will ultimately need to get a bit creative to survive the increasingly tougher sieges.[CR]The player can place additional cannons within walls if they have been placed correctly. Ideally, the player is able to construct as many cannon enclosures as possible to maximize their offensive output and repel the enemy forces without incurring too much damage.[CR]In single-player, the player starts out by choosing where their fortress will be placed. They're then surrounded by a wall, and can then place their cannons. Following this are a set of rounds; the first being attack, the second repair. After surviving this barrage, the player is given additional time to place more cannons in their fort. The game ends when the player fails to successfully repair their castle, or when enough of the enemy fleet has been sunk.[CR]</plot>

		<title_clean>Rayman</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Rayman is a 2D platforming game developed by Ubisoft and has appeared on a range of different systems. It was first released on the Atari Jaguar and MSDOS in 1995, then released on the Sony PlayStation and Sega Saturn two months later. The game marked the debut of the Rayman series of video games.[CR]Rayman can also be found on the GameBoy Advance, under the title of Rayman Advance. It is also available on the US and UK Playstation Store and can be purchased for $5.99 and &#163;3.99 respectively. On the week of 7th December 2009 Rayman was released for DSiWare[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]Rayman's world during the intro sequence[CR]Rayman lives in a peaceful world where the magical creatures and nature coexist with one another. It's not until Mister Dark, a cloaked villain claims the Great Protoon for himself and destroys the balance and harmony in Rayman's world. The electoons that orbited the Great Protoon were scattered across the land and locked in cages. It's up to Rayman to free the electoons and reclaim the Great Protoon stolen by Mister Dark so the world can live in harmony once more.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Rayman is a traditional 2D platformer that involves the player having to reach the end of each side-scrolling stage. Rayman has a health bar that can be increased from three hearts to six by collecting a special power up. If all of his health bar is depleted, Rayman will lose a life.[CR]At the beginning of the game, Rayman can't do anything besides walk and jump, but at certain points in the game he is given new abilities by Betilla the fairy. He will eventually be able to use his fists to punch at enemies, hang onto ledges and grab onto various objects, including swinging from floating loops in the air. He can also learn to fly for a short amount of time and also run when a button is held down.[CR]As Rayman explores each stage, he is able to collect small blue objects called Tings. He can offer them to the Magician, who can give Rayman access to special bonus stages. Collecting one hundred Tings will also award Rayman with an extra life.[CR]The main aim of the game is to collect every single electoon in the stages throughout the game. Every stage has six electoon cages hidden, which need to be found in order to access the final stages and the final boss battle.[CR][B]Releases:[/B][CR]There are many different versions and releases of Rayman. The game's development goes as far back as the Super Nintendo. Due to a shift in technological advancement, the 16-bit platforms were becoming financially unfeasable and bieng overshadowed by newer platforms, giving way for more advanced hardware. After skipping platforms such as the Sega 32X, Rayman would finally make it's debut on a cartridge based system.Rayman (Jaguar)Story sequences were told through stills in the Jaguar version.Rayman's first release. Running on the Atari Jaguar.[CR]The very first version of Rayman was released on the Atari Jaguar has several differences and features not seen in any other version of the game ranging from level design, presentation and more. For example the Moskito flying stages were shoot-em-up stages where the Moskito shot a laser from it's beak to defeat enemies. While it was altered for future versions of the game, this gameplay design would later be seen in Rayman Origins years later. Story elements were told through still images and artwork but still carried the same basic plot featuring Mr. Dark and the protoons. This is also one of two versions of Rayman that features a breakout clone. During development, the game also featured artwork and sprites representinglimbs for Rayman but were cut from the final version due to technical limitations and cartridge space which became an important factor in Rayman's character design.Rayman (Playstation 1, Sega Saturn and MS-DOS)The advancement in hardware provided several benefits for Rayman, none of which involved limbs.[CR]Due to the failure of the Jaguar platform, Ubisoft was quick to release the game for the launch of disc based systems. Because of the additional space and longer development time, the developers were able to add in higher quality sound and CD based redbook audio for the music giving way for speech, orchestrated music and even full motion video. Levels were refined and in some cases made even harder than the original version. This version would become the base for future releases of Rayman on modern consoles and handhelds. The MS-DOS version also saw various re-releases usually bundled with a level designer. The Playstation 1 version is currently available for purchase for Playstation 3, Portable and Vita systems through the Playstation Store.Rayman Gold (MS-DOS)[CR]The game was released on the PC on 28 September 1997. Along with the original game, this package contained the Windows-based Rayman Designer, allowing players to design and create their own levels and then share them with others via the internet. The game also contained 24 new, original levels; these had the same gameplay, but featured some new concepts and gameplay elements including collecting differently colored Tings that allow Rayman to progress in a level by opening paths. Other features were added such as event-triggering Tings, additional objects and a level timer to see how fast the player can finish the level.Rayman Forever (MS-DOS)[CR]Around a year later a second PC version was released. Featuring the same content as Rayman Gold along with with 50+ new levels over the original and a fridge magnet. Various sections of the soundtrack were erased to save space on the disc. This version is also available through GOG.com.Rayman Collector (MS-DOS)[CR]A final variation of the DOS version with 60 additional levels.Rayman Advance (Game Boy Advance)Limited cartridge space caused the developers to compress the graphics to pixelated detail.Rayman was released during the launch of the Game Boy Advance.[CR]Digital Eclipse and Junglevision Software developed Rayman Advance which was released on the Game Boy Advance at the system's launch to capitalize on the system's 32-bit processor. The game was made easier to accommodate for the smaller screen by giving Rayman an extra hit-point and making certain sections easier to progress through. The game also did not reset the Ting score once a life was lost giving players better chances at obtaining extra lives. Because of the limited cartridge space, the game's graphics were compressed, music was adapted into a midi-like format and sound effects became tinny or non-existant in the port.Rayman (Nintendo DSi)The DSi version has the second screen show a map of the entire level that can scroll independently from Rayman by dragging the stylus on the touch screen.Nintendo.com advertisement artwork.[CR]Making Fun and Junglevision Software developed the Nintendo DSi version for Nintendo's DSiWare digital download platform and also available in the eShop for Nintendo 3DS systems. The game was made even easier by using the same alterations as the GBA port received excluding graphical and audio compression, and Rayman is given between six to ten hit points depending on conditions and thirty continues. Some of the audio tracks taken from CD versions of the game, sound effects are low in pitch, and the game makes use of several features of the system. The inner Nintendo DSi camera will take a picture each time a checkpoint is used. The touch screen displays the entire map that can be seen by dragging the stylus in any direction and highlights key objects through the level such as Rayman's position, checkpoints and end level signposts. It also includes an achievement system that determines when a world is completed, when all the Electoons are freed and if the player has not used a continue.[CR]Game Boy Color Version[CR]The tale unfolds similarly, but certain asthetics represent Rayman 2 which came out around the same time as this version.The Game Boy Color version features all-new levels separate from the 32-Bit Rayman.[CR]Rayman for Game Boy Color, while similar in plot and environments, is actually a different game, however it also borrows elements from Rayman 2 as the game was released well after the original Rayman. The game follows a similar, linear progression where Rayman must free Protoons, some of which that cannot be found until Rayman has located power-ups. The only way to go back to free cages in previous levels is to complete the game which unlocks a world map. The game is also one of the few to feature the Ubi-Key which makes use of the Infrared sensor that is cross compatible with other Ubi-Soft published Game Boy Color titles. Keys found for Rayman would unlock hidden levels that cannot be obtained otherwise.[CR]PC Requirements[CR]486/33 (minimum);[CR]Pentium (recommended);[CR]Windows 95;[CR]DOS version 5.0 (minimum);[CR]2x CD-ROM drive (minimum);[CR]4MB RAM (minimum);[CR]8MB RAM (recommended);[CR]VLB Graphics card 256 colors (minimum);[CR]Sound Blaster compatible sound card;[CR]700MB free hard drive space;[CR]Mouse &amp; Keyboard.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Gameplay Codes[CR]During gameplay, pause your game and enter the following codes:[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level passwords[CR]Use these passwords to get to any of the levels.</plot>

		<title_clean>Rayman 2 - The Great Escape</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Rayman 2: The Great Escape is a 3D platformer that was developed by Ubisoft and first released in 1999. Players take control of Rayman, a limbless hero whose main attack is shooting his fists and energy balls at his opponents. This is the first Rayman game to be made in 3D. Rayman's powers include shooting his fists (which take the form of energy balls) and his helicopter ears (which allow him to descend slowly, and sometimes fly). He is also able to grab onto ledges and attain new heights via the use of purple lums. Lastly, he is able to innovate, riding a plum down a river of lava, riding on the back of a rocket, flying with a flaming gunpower barrel, and hitching a ride attached to a swamp creature named Ssssam.[CR]Unlike its predecessor, Rayman 2's visual design and score strike a much more dark and dreary tone, while still not taking away the mystifying and vibrant universe that is iconic to the Rayman games. Levels range from marshlands to oceanic bays to crazy dreamworlds to lava temples and robot pirate ship grottoes.[CR]Rayman 2 received positive reviews from critics, who highlighted the fact that the series managed to make the transition from 2D to 3D much more seamlessly than a number of other similar platformers.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]On a dark and stormy night, Ly the Fairy reaches out to Rayman for help. The world is in trouble. Admiral Razorbeard and his pirate army have taken over most of the world and enslaved its inhabitants. Unfortunately, Rayman has been captured and put aboard the pirate ship Buccaneer. His friend Globox is thrown into a room with him shortly after, and Rayman remarks to his old friend that he feels weak, and that this may be the end. Luckily, Globox had been given a silver lum by Ly, which in turn he gives to Rayman. It rejuvenates him, and together they bust out of the ship.[CR]After a long trip down, Rayman lands in the Woods of Light, one of the few places the pirates have not infiltrated. Globox is nowhere to be found, but Rayman does come into contact with Murfy, who provides him with guidance. He also finds the Teensies, who show him the way to the Hall of Doors. Once there, Rayman travels to the Fairy Glade, where he saves a weakened Ly the Fairy from the pirates. He then learns how dire the situation really is. The pirates hold sway in almost all corners of the world. Razorbeard has also split the heart of the world into 1000 lums and scattered them throughout.[CR]To set things right, Rayman needs to find the 4 masks of power. Only by having these 4 masks can he summon Polokus, the creator of the world, who will then be able to destroy the pirates once and for all. As soon as Rayman gets this information, he is off. Along the way, he will encounter much resistance, many challenges, and a pirate captain bent on the destruction of his world. No problem, for a hero without limbs.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Rayman 2 features an array of imaginative and colorful characters, perfectly complementing the exciting gameplay experience.Rayman[CR]Rayman is an unsuspecting hero who is dragged into the fight against the pirates, while also being responsible for repairing the damage that has been done to the world through the collection of items known as lums. Clearly the plight of the world is close to his heart, as he is friends to a number of the creatures of the forest including Globox and Ly.[CR] Globox[CR]Globox is a dear friend of Rayman that you first encounter at the beginning of the game as you help him to escape from his pirate cell. Despite being a huge coward, Globox can often be useful throughout the game with his ability to use magic, an example being his special &#8216;rain-dance&#8217;.[CR] Murfy[CR]Following the tradition of many games in the platforming genre, Rayman 2 also features a tutorial fairy, known as Murfy. Responsible for introducing the player to various game mechanics and items, Murfy clearly is an important ally for those new to the game. Murfy can be summoned by the player standing on his corresponding tile.[CR] Ly[CR]Ly the fairy is another friend of Rayman who helps him out in a different way to Murfy. During their first encounter (in which Rayman rescues Ly from being held captive by the pirates), Ly gives Rayman the power to use purple lums. Ly also helps to grant Rayman greater power throughout the progress of the game, through items known as silver lums.[CR] Razorbeard[CR]Razorbeard is the leader of the evil robot pirates, and forms an inexplicably evil adversary to Rayman. With an army of giant airships and hordes of evil minions he clearly poses a great threat to the sanctity of the world. His evil deeds know no bounds, as we discover that he has imprisoned many of the creatures of the land and has ravaged the world of its magical power (the lums), which Rayman must find scattered throughout the world.[CR] Polokus[CR]Polokus is an ancient being that sits on a totem in the Spirit World awaiting the four magic masks, which Rayman is required to locate. Only after awakening the spirit of Polokus does Rayman truly stand a chance of defeating the pirates.[CR] Clark[CR]The buff, broad-shouldered, balloon-chinned giant known as Clark is another friend of Rayman. He is first encountered in the Menhir Hills level, where he asks Rayman to bring him medicine from the Cave of Bad Dreams. After he has been cured, he allows Rayman to ride on top of his back as he smashes through walls. He returns later in the game in a mind-controlled state as a mini-boss that Rayman must defeat.[CR] Carmen[CR]Carmen the whale is another odd friend of Rayman who is also captured by the pirates and must be freed by Rayman. In the PlayStation version Carmen leads Rayman to the Temple of Water and Ice; in all other versions she leads him out of the level.[CR] Sssssam[CR]Sssssam the snake acts as the ferryman of the glades. He is trapped in a cage by the evil pirates, but is rescued by Rayman during the game. To show his gratitude, Sssssam then gives Rayman a ride through the Marshes of Awakening along a treacherous water ski-like course, at the end of which he leaves Rayman to continue his adventure alone.[CR][B]Releases:[/B][CR]PlayStation[CR]The PlayStation version only featured fewer lums to collect as well as truncated level design to compensate for the system hardware. This version also features enemies and boss fights not seen in any other version including an enemy last seen in the original Rayman. Along with the PlayStation 2 version, the game featured complete voice overs for the dialogue.Nintendo 64Nintendo 64 US Boxart[CR]The Nintendo 64 version featured compatibility with the N64 Expansion Pak. It also featured music converted and fitted to work with the hardware as the other versions used CD audio. This was also the base version of Rayman DS and is similar to the PC version.PC/WindowsThe PC version looks and sounds great. However it does not feature any of the enhancements seen in the Dreamcast version.[CR]The PC version runs similar to the Nintendo 64 version retaining some features from the disc based versions. It can run at high resolutions and features the best quality sound out of all the other versions. The PC version suffers from a few issues such as un-customizable controls for both keyboard and joystick/gamepads and the installer is incompatible with 64-bit processors and cannot be installed on such platforms. This version is currently available for purchase on GOG.com and is able to run on 64-bit systems due to a different installer wrapper. It was also given free to pre-purchase owners of Rayman Origins on Steam.Sega DreamcastThe Dreamcast release runs at 60 frames per second maximum.[CR]The Dreamcast version is considered the best version of the game with higher resolution graphics, fast framerate, and extra features including online downloadable content such as mini games and a 4 player multiplayer mode. Levels are given additional geometry and effects to take advantage of the hardware compared to the versions released before. This version added 6 Globox Crystals hidden in a few levels that could be taken to the Globox Village to unlock bonuses. This was also the base version of Rayman 3D.Playstation 2 (Rayman 2 Revolution)Environments are given a substantial upgrade over every other version of the game.[CR]The Playstation 2 version was an even further enhanced version of Rayman 2 running on the Renderware engine. Graphics were given more detail, levels were expanded and the world map was replaced with a hub world that would also feature a more prominent appearance of other characters such as Clark and Carmen. Cutscenes are expanded and is given speech for all supported languages and features more detailed "Raymanian" speech. This version also suffers from some framerate issues and sound glitches. Currently this version of the game is available for download on the Playstation Store for Playstation 3 owners.Nintendo DS (Rayman DS)Rayman DS US Cover Art[CR]Rayman 2 was ported to the DS soon after it's launch under the name "Rayman DS" to capitalize on the launch window of the Nintendo DS system and intended to take advantage of the success similar to Rayman Advance on Game Boy Advance. Converted from the Nintendo 64 version by DC Studios, it faced several conversion issues. For example due to the smaller cartridge size, certain textures are compressed and certain indicators are unintelligible due to improper scaling. Much like Super Mario 64's DS, players could utilize the touch screen as a replicated analog control stick, but was criticized as being too imprecise.Nintendo 3DS (Rayman 3D)The 3DS port was rushed for launch of the system and suffers from a number of performance issues.[CR]The Nintendo 3DS version was converted from the Sega Dreamcast version and makes use of the analog slide pad for analog control and the system's 3D capabilities.The difficulty has been toned down to better adapt for quick play on the handheld format similar to the DSi port of the original Rayman. The game now saves after each section or cutscene, Rayman rotates with the camera when holding left or right on the D-Pad to turn the camera, health refills after being inflicted with instant death and certain sections have been altered for easier progress. The game was poorly adapted to the hardware to make it in time for system launch and has received numerous faults. The framerate is wildly inconsistent and sluggish at more intense areas, sound effects are missing or cut out during normal gameplay while music sounds overdriven, certain skybox textures alias incorrectly, certain scenery and objects are incorrectly scaled, and texture work sometimes appears stretched or missing. Reports indicated prior to launch that the 4 player mini game would return for local wireless multiplayer, however it does not exist in the final version as the Dreamcast DLC, Globox Village and collectables associated with it have been removed from this version.iPhone/iPad[CR]Gameloft has converted the game to the iPhone which is also compatible with iTouch, and iPad. Controls are entirely touch based with "Virtual" joysticks and key actions mapped to the screen.[CR]Some boss characters, such as Colossus and Ninjaws do not appear in every version. Interactive cut-scenes are also cut from certain versions.[CR]Game Boy Color Version (Rayman 2 Revolution)[CR]Most of Rayman's moves resembe the powers seen in the first Rayman game on 32-bit platforms.[CR]Much like Rayman 1 on Game Boy Color, Rayman 2 saw an 8-bit portable rendition on Nintendo's handheld and features new levels and content. In the US, it shared the same name as the major console version. Whereas in the UK, it was named Rayman 2 Revolution but is not to be confused with the Playstation 2 version. Playing similarly to Rayman on Game Boy Color, creatures are locked away in cages and must be freed by Rayman in order to fight back the pirate army. Unlike the last Game Boy title, the password system was replaced by a battery back-up save system to keep and restore progress and does not contain any Ubi-Key features.[CR]PC Requirements[CR]Windows 95/98Pentium 133 (Min.)4x CD-ROM drive (Min.)32 MB RAM (Min.)4MB D3D compatible graphics card.DirectX compatible sound card.300MB free hard drive space.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Refill Health Cheat[CR]Pause the game and press B, Right, A, Up, B, Left, A, Down, B, Right. If entered correctly the game will automatically unpause and your health bar will be full again.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Bonus World Map[CR]Collect all cages and lums. It should appear on the world map as a giant cave.</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Ready 2 Rumble Boxing was Midway's 1999 take on the arcade boxing game, channeling the spirit of Nintendo's classic Punch-Out!! It featured a roster of colorful characters, each with a distinct personality and fighting style, such as Afro Thunder or Boris "The Bear" Knokimov. If a player could land enough hits to spell out the word "RUMBLE," then they would be able to unleash a powerful special move called a "Rumble Flurry."[CR]Ready 2 Rumble was followed by a late 2000 sequel called Ready to Rumble Boxing: Round 2, which featured celebrity guest characters, ranging from Michael Jackson to both Bill and Hillary Clinton.[CR][B]Game Modes:[/B][CR]Arcade Mode[CR]The arcade mode is were players can pick a fighter to go through a series of fighters to unlock other characters.Championship Mode[CR]The Championship Mode is where players can pick a fighter and go through several modes - "Train Boxer," "Title Fight," "Prize Fight," "Exhibition Fight," "Trade Boxer."[CR]The player can train a fighter in the "Train Boxer" mode, the mode if where the player can built up certain attribute of the fighter.[CR]"Title Fight" is where the player can move their character up in the ranks.[CR]"Prize Fight" is where the player can earn money from fights that the player can participate in.

		<title_clean>Resident Evil Gaiden</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Resident Evil: Gaiden is the first and only Resident Evil game for the Game Boy Color, Development began after the port of the original Resident Evil to the system was canceled. A notable change in perspective, movement, and combat were made to bring the series to a handheld system. Later games in the series make no mention, or even directly contradict, the events of Resident Evil: Gaiden, and have proven the story of this game is non canon.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Resident Evil: Gaiden is played from two perspectives. Movement is controlled from a top-down perspective while combat is in a first person perspective. Combat is initiated by moving a d-pad controlled reticule over an on screen, or when a zombie comes in contact with the character. Once combat begins, a bar with a slider appears at the bottom of the screen, representing the player's aim. Enemies are damaged when the player attacks while the slider moves over the bar representing the enemy, and timing is key. The center of the enemy's bar can be attacked for critical damage. The player controls up to three characters at once, with the ability to switch characters and enter the item screen without pausing the battle.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Following the destruction of Raccoon City, an organization is formed whose mission is to put an end to Umbrella. Leon S. Kennedy is sent to investigate the existence of a new Bio-Organic Weapon (B.O.W.) that is said to be on the ocean liner, Starlight. Contact with Leon is lost, and Barry Burton is sent in to find Leon and eliminate the B.O.W.[CR]Soon after arrival, Barry discovers the passengers have become zombies. A scream let's Barry know that at least one person is still alive. The scream comes from a girl named Lucia, who is being chased by the B.O.W. Barry tries to protect her, but the B.O.W. manages to capture her.[CR]Barry finds Leon, catches him up with what's going on, and they go after the girl and manage to rescue her. Soon after, an explosion threatens to sink the ship. Leon and Lucia go off to activate the sprinkler system, while Barry attempts to communicate with headquarters for an air lift.[CR]After successfully activating the sprinklers, Leon and Lucia find their way back to Barry. However, as they reunite, the two of them overhear Barry making a deal to sell Lucia to Umbrella. Leon confronts him, and Barry pulls a gun on Leon and takes Lucia captive.[CR]Barry takes Lucia to an Umbrella submarine that is waiting for him. Before he can go after her, another explosion rocks the ship, and Leon runs to attempt to repair the damage. He finds the B.O.W., fights it off, but learns there is no hope for the ship.[CR]On board, the captain tells him that there is a parasite in Lucia that will turn her into a new B.O.W. in ten days. Barry reveals his deal was simply a deception to get on board the submarine, and he forces the submarines surgeons to remove the parasite. Unfortunately, the parasite escapes, and infects the inhabitants of the sub, and Barry and Lucia are forced to flee back to the sinking ship.[CR]The two of them find what appears to be Leon, but it turns out the new B.O.W.s are shape-shifters. They escape and find the real Leon in the engine room. They return to the top deck to confront the B.O.W., and it pulls Lucia into the sea. Barry rescues her, but then another Lucia appears. Lucia cuts her hand, revealing red blood, as opposed to the green blood of the B.O.W., and the three of them make a final stand.[CR]The three of them are rescued, and Lucia is offered a place to live in Barry's home. The final scene shows green blood dripping from Leon's neck.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Unlimited Gas Launcher rounds[CR]First, equip the Gas Launcher with at least one gas round. Then, engage and enemy in battle, and use the 'run' feature with the character equipped with the Gas Launcher. When in 'run mode', pushing the action button will cause you to fire a gas round without depleting your ammo count, thus killing all on-screen enemies.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] 99 Handgun Bullets[CR]You have to be in the engine room before fighting the B.O.W. on the 12th save point. Die on purpose when fighting the B.O.W. Use a continue. Get the handgun bullets and keep doing this until you have 99 handgun bullets.</plot>

		<title_clean>Revelations - The Demon Slayer</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Revelations: The Demon Slayer (known as Megami Tensei Gaiden: Last Bible in Japan) stars young hero El and eventually his two companions, Kishe and Uranus. Very little is actually laid out about any of these characters, other than the fact that you're on a quest to become a Gaia Master and save the world, and the other two are along to fill your party because, hey, you saved their lives. The game is very lengthy and contains over a hundred types of monsters that you can recruit, much like Dragon Quest V.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]"Long before human beings existed...[CR]Telepathy, Teleportation, Telekinesis...[CR]Powers that only -GODS- could harness.[CR]-GODS- named this power[CR]-GAIA-[CR] This is the beginning of tragedy." (game intro)[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The Demon Slayer features simple random encounter text-based RPG gameplay, very similar to Dragon Quest. You cannot see your characters in battle, just the effects of their attacks. A unique feature to this game is the ability to "negotiate" with your enemies instead of fight them. Depending on your level and the level of your enemies, they may just attack you, or ask you vague yes-and-no questions. If you answer them correctly, they will join your team.[CR]An example would be if you were fighting a Spider, you can select "TALK" from your commands. The Spider will first ask you if you want him to join you. Proceeding from there, he will ask you if he should truly respect you, if you understand his pain, etc. and if your answers please him, he'll join you. There is a party limit of six, but you can recruit basically as many monsters as you'd like.[CR]Otherwise, battles are very straightforward, involving attacks, spells, defending, items, and even an auto battle option to speed things up. Character leveling is equally simple, though you can customize your hero to be more physical attack based or magic based.[CR]One fun thing you can do with recruited monsters is combine them together to form ostensibly more powerful monsters. This creates another level of depth to an otherwise very simple game.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Recruit Cerbero[CR]Cerbero, the companion of Orthrus, is in an invisible cave. To get to his location, head north from the city full of monsters, called the Monster Nest, and follow the forest. There is a patch of land in the north-western section that has no tree on it. Walk over it, and you'll find Cerbero inside, along with lots and lots of rare goodies.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Recruit Cerbero[CR]Orthrus, companion of Cerbero, is easily recruited if you know what you're doing. After you follow Triton to a private island on the dolphin, you will be in a cave. There, Orthrus will attack you in order to protect Triton. If you defeat him, he will be badly injured. He will mumble something incoherently. Bring him a &amp;quot;Rune&amp;quot; item, which revives any character, and he will be fully restored. Thankful and apologetic, he will join your team immediately.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Recruit Cerbero[CR]After you complete the game, and the credits have gone by, you are able to continue the game. Now you can recruit four of the Gaia Masters. [CR]Baal is on Mt. Palo [CR]Lucifer is in the Cave of Oasis [CR]Michael is in Nova [CR]Vaerial is in the Nest of the Zord</plot>

		<title_clean>Road Rash</title_clean>
		<plot>Road Rash is an aggressive motorcycle racing game where the player assumes the role of a biker who takes part in a series of illegal races across the U.S.A. Starting at the back of the pack the objective is always to finish first on a linear course, overtaking the other bikers. This is achieved by driving very well or by playing it dirty, knocking opponents of their bikes using clubs, crowbars or your bare hands. The other racers fight back in a similar fashion and there are also hazards. All the races take place on the regular road with normal traffic (in both directions) and the cops, as well as occasional oil slicks and stray cows.[CR]By winning races you can get promoted to a stronger division and earn cash with which you can buy a better bike. Whenever you're knocked off your bike or hit something you will have to run back to your bike and lose valuable time, plus your bike will suffer some damage. When the player crashes with cops nearby, it is possible to get busted and then you have to forfeit the race.[CR]Like the whole Road Rash lineage, the game has arcade-like gameplay with no intention to be a motorcycle simulation. While the game has a two-player mode, this is not simultaneous.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Misc. Passwords[CR]From the Main Menu, choose Options and then Password and enter one of the following:</plot>

		<plot>OCP Technologies has developed an organic and mechanical hybrid supercomputer which they've named "The Mind". Unknown to the scientists however, The Mind has secretly been infiltrating computer networks around the world. When the project is finally deemed complete, OCP puts The Mind in control of the security systems of Delta City. At the same time, a gang war erupts in the city and several laboratories are broken into and looted. The police recieve a lead on a gang leader named "Nexx" who may be involved and assign RoboCop, a cyborg law enforcement officer, to bring him in.[CR]RoboCop is primarily a top-down action game. Robocop can move up, down, left and right across the map. Enemy units should be shot at to engage, while civilian units need to be protected. RoboCop's objective varies by level but typically involves destroying a particular enemy or finding "evidence" items scattered throughout the level. Each level is made up of several maps screens. Between missions RoboCop returns to the police station where he can consult with his ex-partner Lewis, review the station's news or talk to Dr. Lazerus, the scientist in charge of cybernetics.</plot>

		<plot>[CR]The third installment in the Rush series, 2049 was released for the Nintendo 64 to mixed reviews.  The game featured the same arcade physics, spectacular crashes, and over-the-top jumps as the first two games, with a few tweaks.  The game severely curtailed the number of listed statistics for each car from the large number present in L.A. Rush.  Gone were the dubiously significant "Torque" and "Drift" bars, replaced more the more user-friendly "Top Speed", "Acceleration", "Cornering" and "Traction".  Graphically, the game took significant steps forward from L.A. especially in the vehicle models, which featured richer textures and higher polygon counts.  2049 brought back the Stunt mode introduced in L.A. Rush.  Players still spent most of their time driving toward ramps in hopes of achieving some point-worthy result, but the introduction of wings into the game gave racers the control over their landings.  Along with the goal of achieving high scores for various stunts and flips, tokens could be collected in the stunt mode which unlocked various upgrades and new vehicles.  2049 was also released as a top-down racer for the game boy color.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Cheat Passwords[CR]From the Main Menu, choose Password and enter one or more of the following:</plot>

		<plot>This is a portable edition of the solitaire game Shanghai, the game uses traditional Mah Jong tiles. The aim of the game is to match tiles, four of each type will be put on the playing field, when two tiles are matched they are removed when none remain you win. Only tiles that can be moved freely to the left or right may be matched. A wrong move may result in you not being able to clear the field. [CR]A slight story mode is presented in the Shanghai mode; each tile setup is based on a Zodiac animal that needs it power restored. The goal is to complete all twelve of these stages there by restoring the animals power. [CR]Some variants are also included:[CR]1. Kong Kong: Compete against a computer to clear tiles. If you go slowly you will have tiles sent over to your by your opponent. This type of play is similar to games like Puyo Pop. Kong Kong may be played against another player by using a link cable or against a computer.[CR]2. Challenge (WonderSwan only): A large Shanghai game that you'll try to race through to get the best score. [CR]3. Goldrush: In this mode you will race against an opponent to reach a tile marked 'G'. G is for GOLD, boy! So get cracking.</plot>

		<title_clean>Shantae</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Shantae is a action platformer developed by WayForward Technologies and published by Capcom for the Game Boy Color on June 2, 2002. The game was released late in the life of the Game Boy Color and featured several enhancements when played on the Game Boy Advance. Despite Shantae's initially poor sales the game eventually became a cult classic and fostered a passionate fan base. The game was released on the 3DS Virtual Console on June 20, 2013.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The game starts with Shantae emerging from her lighthouse to realize that Scuttle Town, of which she is protector, was under attack by Risky boots, and her band of lousy pirates. When Shantae confronts Risky Boots, she discovers that Boots has stolen a Steam Engine from the villages Relic Hunter, Mimic. Shantae makes her way to water town, where she meets a buffoon by the name of Bolo, who knows where Risky Boots has gone. He leads Shantae to the Bubble Fountain. Once inside, she meets an imprisoned genie that teaches her the monkey transformation dance. She uses the monkey transformation to defeat the boss of the temple, which Risky Boots was unable to tame, and recovers the Dribble Stone. After being told that she needs to find the Golem Stone, her next destination is Oasis Town.After trekking across the desert and hoping over many a manticore and cactus, Shantae arrives in Oasis Town, where she is greeted by her old friend Sky and her friend Wrench. Sky sends Wrench to find the Golem Mines, where she suspects the Golem Stone is waiting.Shantae eventually comes across the Golem Mines, where she finds yet another imprisoned genie, and sets her free to learn the elephant transformation dance. She reaches the bottom of the mine and the location of the Golem Stone only to find that Risky Boots has once again beat her to it. Shantae reveals that she knows all about Risky's plan to use the relics to power her Steam Engine, and as Risky attempts to take the Golem Stone, a giant Golem appears out of the darkness to knock her away, leaving Shantae to fight the beast alone. She succeeds and recovers the Golem Stone.Once she emerges from the cave, Shantae is greeted by Wrench, who has a note for her from Sky. Sky says that she has found someone who knows the location of one of the magical stones, by the name or Rottytops, and mentions that she is part of the Zombie Caravan.Shantae makes her way to the Caravan and comes across a cart with a "keep out" sign across the front. Naturally, she goes inside, and finds Rottytops, who immediately challenges Shantae to a race, with the price of losing being Shantaes brains. When Shantae wins the race, Rottytops brings her to her next destination, the Cackle Mound Labyrinth, and the location of the Simmer Stone. Rottytops uses her femur to unlock the foreboding dungeon, and Shantae enters.Once inside, Shantae discovers that the Labyrinth is full of zombies and other undead creatures. She comes across yet another genie, who in gratitude teaches her the Spider dance, which Shantae uses to climb along the many spider webs around the dungeon. She manages to beat Risky Boots to the Simmer Stone, but still has to fight a creature in order to claim possession of it. Emerging victorious, Rottytops tells Shantae that the last relic should be somewhere in the area of Mount Pointy for the Twinkle Stone, and that Rottytops and her caravan would be moving in order to stay one step ahead of Risky Boots.Shantae makes her way past the desert into the mountains, and happens upon the sleepy village of Bandit Town, complete with its own tavern and resident protection genie. After speaking which the genie, who chooses not to reveal her name, she leads Shantae to the summit of Mt. Pointy, and unlocks the door to the Twinkle Palace, whose tunnels stretch throughout the mountain. Shantae finds yet another genie imprisoned by a monster of the labyrinth, and from her learns a dance that turns her into the flying harpy creature. She uses the power to pounce on top of the leashed dragon plaguing the dungeon and retrieve the Twinkle stone momentarily.As soon as she leaves the palace, the genie she met in the town below binds her with a magic spell and reveals herself to be Risky Boots. Risky takes each of the artifacts Shantae has acquired for her own and runs away to her hideaway. Not knowing where to find Risky Boots, Shantae meets with Mimic in Scuttle Town, where he suggests that she go to the highest place she can find and look out for Risky and her lair. After flying around in the desert in her newly learned Harpy form, Shantae comes across a platform in the sky with a magical telescope attached. The telescope talks to her, asking to look into her soul before she may use it, and decides she is worthy of looking through the device. She almost immediately spots Risky's lair, an island, and the Telescope kindly teleports her to the location.Upon landing on the Island, Shantae is immediately assaulted by an array of Tinkerbats with a variety of weapons, like mechas and pistols. She has to smash the pillars that block her path in elephant form, climb through the plumbing in her monkey form, and climb above spiked pits in her spider form in order to make it to Risky Boots office, where she drops Shantae into the hanger holding her new weapon, the Tinkertank! Unfortunately for Risky, Shantae makes her way inside the behemoth and destroys the artifacts, and in doing so destroys the vehicle. In a blind rage, Risky attacks Shantae with everything she has, but fails to defeat her, so instead tries to leave Shantae to blow up with the entire fortress.Shantae tries to fly up and out of Riskys cave in her Harpy transformation before being blown to bits, and exits the complex much like the millenium falcon exited the Death Star before passing out. She sees the four genies that she saved from captivity, and they offer to transform her into a full genie. Shantae declines, disappointing that she would be forced to leave her many friends, and instead elects to return to Sequin Land. When she wakes up, she finds Mimic standing above her. She decides to reveal to the mayor that she isn't a full genie, but in overhearing her conversation, the mayor reveals that he heard her confession, and says he doesn't care. After all, she saved the town and maybe the entire land from destruction and tyranny. The game ends showing a tinkerbat repairing the hole Risky Boots shot into Shantae's home at the beginning of the game while the resident half-genie takes in a little bit of sun.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]ShantaeShantae is a half genie that is tasked with protection of the land. She spends her time protecting Scuttle Town while hanging out in her Lighthouse. When Risky Boots steals something precious from a resident of the town, Shantae goes after her in order to fulfill her duty.Risky BootsRisky Boots, with Shantae and TinkerbatsThe most fearsome pirate on the high seas, Risky Boots is the leader of an army of robotic Tinkerbats. She is on a quest to collect the steam engine and the various stones that can power it, in order to build a fearsome ship she can use for her evil deeds.BoloWhether he is named after the weapon he carries, or the other way around, is unknown. What is known is that Bolo is a fairly stupid person that has a very soft spot for the ladies.RottytopsWhen Shantae is told to visit the Zombie Caravan, she runs across a strange bunch of zombies apparently lead by this young corpse. Rottytops is fiercely competitive, especially when it comes to running.SkySky is an old friend of Shantae and an accomplished falconeer. She has her bird Nomad trained so well that it was able to lead Shantae to her distant destination.MimicMimic is an old friend of Shantae and a resident of Scuttle Town. He was the inventor of the steam engine that Risky stole to use for her own purposes.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Shantae is a side-scrolling platformer that plays similarly to a Castlevania game, where the main character wanders the world taking out enemies with her whip (the difference being that Shantae doesn't wield a whip, but in fact her own hair). Shantae is also able to transform by performing a variety of dances, and some of those transformations bring powerful attacks with them. Those transformations allow her to progress throughout the world, similar to new abilities in the Castlevania line.Shantae in front of her home, just before the attack.However, the towns and HUD are much more reminiscent of a Zelda game. She is supplied with three hearts worth of life at the beginning of the game, and enemy attacks generally take half a heart. Beating enemies causes their corpses to drop rupee-like currency, which she can use on items. She can purchase a variety of items that allow her to become invisible, shoot fire, or heal herself. Shantae is given a slot in which to equip her items. The towns are laid out in a circular manner, allowing the player to rotate around and select places to visit, such as the store and spa(which allows her to replenish her hearts). It could also be said that the dances she performs could be parallels to the numerous musical instruments used to activate different powers in Zelda games, as she has to keep rhythm for her dances just like the Windwaker. Also in each town can be found a squid mother who is looking for her children and a building devoid of fireflies.[CR]Dances[CR]Monkey Dance. It allows Shantae to transform into a monkey to climb walls and enter small passages. It is performed by pressing Down and Right and is obtained in the Bubble Fountain.Elephant Dance. It allows Shantae to transform into an Elephant to slam into enemies and objects and reveal hidden passages. It is performed by pressing Down and Up, and is obtained in the Golem Mines.Spider Dance. It allows Shantae to transform into a Spider and crawl along webbing and certain walls. It is performed by pressing Down and A, and is obtained in the Cackle Mound Labyrinth.Harpy Dance. It allows Shantae to transform into a harpy and fly anywhere in Sequin Land. It is performed by pressing Down and B and is obtained in the Twinkle Palace.Heart Dance.Tinkerbat Dance. It allows Shantae to transform into a strangely powerful Tinkerbat that can also use the powers of the Monkey, Elephant, and Spider dances. It is obtained from a strange merchant in Bandit Town and is performed by pressing Down, Up, and Up. The Tinkerbat dance can only be obtained when playing on a Gameboy Advance.[CR]Powerups[CR]Monkey Powerup. Allows Shantae to attack in Monkey formElephant Powerup. Allows Shantae to attack in Elephant formSpider Powerup. Allows Shantae to attack in Spider formHarpy Powerup. Allows Shantae to attack in Harpy form.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Access Debug mode[CR]Press left x2, right x8, left x6, right x2, left x7, right x6, left x8 on the title screen. You will get to the debug mode, you start with all powerups, items and transformations and can travel to any map.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Access Debug mode[CR]Press Left, Left, Right, Right, Right, Right, Right, Right, Right, Right, Left, Left, Left, Left, Left, Left, Right, Right, Left, Left, Left, Left, Left, Left, Left, Right, Right, Right, Right, Right, Right, Left, Left, Left, Left, Left, Left, Left, Left at the title screen, then select "Debug Game" at the screen that appears.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Access Debug mode[CR]Enter the debug mode code and start a debug game, then press Down, Up, Up.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Hold more than 999 gems in wallet[CR]Normally when you try to collect more than 999 gems, the game will stop you from collecting more.  However, if you play certain minigames (such as the race against Rottytops once you've gotten the Simmer Stone,) and earn past that limit, the counter will begin to display odd characters instead.  Using this method it's possible to collect over 999 gems, and the game will keep track of the number.  To get the counter to return to normal, simply spend gems until you have 999 or less gems left available.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Play as Tinkerbat[CR]To begin, this game must be played on a Game Boy Advance instead of a Game Boy Color.  When you start up the game, the title screen will say "GBA Enhanced!" in the bottom-left corner if the game recognizes the system properly.  This changes the palette for the game slightly, and also an NPC in Bandit Town will now offer to tell you a secret for 500 gems.  If you enter the "Advanced Genies!" building and pay up, you'll unlock a new dance, which can be performed by pressing Down, Up, Up.The dance allows you to play as a Tinkerbat.  In addition to a sabre attack with a decent range, the Tinkerbat can run, jump, and climb walls like the monkey; charge foward like the elephant (by holding down and pressing B); and climb walls like the spider.</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]One of the earliest shooting games, Space Invaders was released by Taito in Japan on June 19, 1978. Gameplay involves attempting to defeat waves of aliens cascading down from the top of the screen with a laser cannon that moves along a fixed horizontal axis. The only goal is to earn as many points as possible. Designer Tomohiro Nishikado was in charge of planning, graphic design, and programming for the game and drew creative inspiration from such diverse sources as Gun Fight, Breakout, The War of the Worlds, and Star Wars. The game&#8217;s development cycle lasted for one year, during which Nishikado created custom hardware and software. The game achieved massive popularity upon its release (leading to a temporary shortage of one hundred yen coins in Japan), and helped usher in the golden age of arcade video games (circa 1978-1984).[CR]Space Invaders sold over 400,000 arcade cabinets worldwide and grossed around $3.8 billion in revenue by 1982, equivalent to over $13 billion in 2014, making it the highest-grossing video game of all time.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Arcade (cabaret/cocktail) version[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] in Space Invaders is relatively simple. The player controls a small ship that can only move laterally across the bottom of the screen and fires vertically. Five rows of eleven aliens each advance slowly from one side of the screen to the other, dropping down one space and reversing direction when they reach either side. The player&#8217;s task is to acquire points by eliminating enemies and to destroy all of the aliens before they reach the bottom of the screen and complete their &#8220;invasion.&#8221; As aliens are destroyed, the speed of the remaining enemies increases, as does the tempo of the music. Once all of the enemies are destroyed, the wave resets and the difficulty increases (a cycle that can continue indefinitely).[CR]The Invaders constantly shoot back at the player as they advance from side to side across the screen. To help avoid their attacks, the player can hide behind a number of destructible barriers or &#8220;bunkers&#8221; near the bottom of the screen (four in the original version). Occasionally a &#8220;mystery ship&#8221; will appear near the top of the screen and move quickly from one side to the other while making a distinctive klaxon noise. Destroying it rewards the player with a sizeable point bonus.[CR]Development[CR]While working for the Taito Corporation, designer Nishikado was inspired to create Space Invaders by an early Taito electro-mechanical game called Space Monsters, and by the Atari arcade game Breakout. The game was planned to have tanks, planes, and battleships as enemies, but Nishikado was not happy with their onscreen movements. He considered making the enemies human (which would have been easier to animate), but scrapped the idea since he thought it would be immoral for players to shoot them. After he saw a magazine featuring the 1977 film Star Wars, he decided to use a space theme, and based his alien enemies on the squid-like antagonists from the 1953 movie version of The War of the Worlds.Upright cabinet[CR]Due to the limitations of 1970s microprocessors, Nishikado was forced to design and build his own hardware and development tools. The arcade board he put together contained a variety of both Japanese and American components. It used an Intel 8080 central processing unit (designed by American and Japanese engineers), which could output raster graphics on a CRT monitor, but was slow when it came to drawing sprite graphics, so a dedicated Fujitsu MB14241 video shifter (an early example of a graphics chip) was used to accelerate the drawing of sprite graphics to a bitmap framebuffer. Monaural sound was hosted by a combination of analogue circuitry and a Texas Instruments SN76477 sound chip. The system that he put together is now known as the Taito 8080 arcade system board.[CR]In spite of his efforts, Nishikado was unable to program the game exactly as he wanted. The hardware that he had assembled was not powerful enough to display graphics in color and the enemies moved slower than he had intended. Fortunately he discovered that the more enemies that were removed from play, the faster the processor could render those that remained. Rather than attempt to design the game to compensate for the speed increase, he opted to leave it in as a challenging gameplay mechanic.[CR]It was originally released in Japan by Taito as a cocktail cabinet, with monochrome graphics enhanced by a rainbow-colored cellophane overlay to simulate color graphics. Taito and American licence-holder Bally/Midway then created an upright cabinet that used strips of orange and green cellophane applied to the screen to simulate color graphics, though this version only simulated several colors (compared to Taito's original cocktail version simulating a wider range of colors). Both the Japanese and American upright cabinets also included a painted backdrop of a lunar surface and a starscape, and cabinet art featuring large humanoid creatures that bore little resemblance to the in-game enemies. Nishikado claims that this was due to the artist basing his interpretation on the game&#8217;s original title, Space Monsters.[CR]Impact and Legacy[CR]Soon after its release in Japan, Space Invaders became a huge success, completely taking over certain arcades and earning Taito a tidy profit. By the end of 1978, Taito had installed 100,000 machines across the country and grossed over $600 million dollars. An oft-quoted urban legend states that there was a shortage of 100-yen coins&#8212;and subsequent production increase&#8212;in Japan attributed to the game. By 1980, 300,000 cabinets had been sold in Japan and an additional 60,000 in the United States. By 1981, Space Invaders had made Taito more than $1 billion, and continued to gross an average of $600 million per year, through to 1982, by which time it had grossed $2 billion in quarters (equivalent to $4.6 billion in 2011). This made it the best-selling video game and highest-grossing entertainment product of its time, surpassing the then highest-grossing film Star Wars, which had grossed $486 million in movie tickets.Atari 2600 version[CR]The 1980 Atari 2600 version represented the first official licensed port of an arcade game to a home console, and and became the first "killer app" for video game consoles by quadrupling sales of the 2600. It sold over two million units in its first year on sale as a home console game, becoming the first title to sell over a million cartridges. Ports were also released for the Atari 8-bit computer line and the Atari 5200, as well as the Nintendo Entertainment System, Game Boy and SNES. Numerous unofficial clones were made as well, such as the popular computer games Super Invader (1979) and TI Invaders (1981).[CR]Game designer Shigeru Miyamoto considered Space Invaders a game that revolutionized the video game industry; he was never interested in video games before seeing it. Hideo Kojima also described it as the first video game that impressed him and got him interested in video games. Several publications ascribed the expansion of the video game industry from a novelty into a global industry to the success of the game. Edge magazine attributed the shift of video games from bars and arcades to more mainstream locations like restaurants and department stores to Space Invaders. Its popularity was such that it was the first game where an arcade machine's owner could make up for the cost of the machine in under one month, or in some places within one week.[CR]Technology journalist Jason Whittaker credited the game's success to ending the video game crash of 1977, which had earlier been caused by Pong clones flooding the market, and beginning the golden age of video arcade games.According to The Observer, the home console versions were popular and encouraged users to learn programming; many who later became industry leaders. 1UP stated that Space Invaders showed that video games could compete against the major entertainment media at the time: movies, music, and television IGN attributed the launch of the arcade phenomenon in North America in part to Space Invaders. Electronic Games credited the game's success as the impetus behind video gaming becoming a rapidly growing hobby and as "the single most popular coin-operated attraction of all time." Game Informer considered it, along with Pac-Man, one of the most popular arcade games that tapped into popular culture and generated excitement during the golden age of arcades.IGN listed it as one of the "Top 10 Most Influential Games" in 2007, citing the source of inspiration to video game designers and the impact it had on the shooting genre. 1UP ranked it at No. 3 in its list of "The 60 Most Influential Games of All Time," stating that, in contrast to earlier arcade games which "were attempts to simulate already-existing things," Space Invaders was "the first video game as a video game, instead of merely a playable electronic representation of something else." In 2008, Guinness World Records listed it as the top-rated arcade game in technical, creative, and cultural impact.[CR]As one of the earliest shooting games, it set precedents and helped pave the way for future titles and for the shooting genre. Space Invaders popularized a more interactive style of gameplay with the enemies responding to the player controlled cannon's movement, and was the first video game to popularize the concept of achieving a high score, being the first to save the player's score. While earlier shooting games allowed the player to shoot at targets, Space Invaders was the first in which targets could fire back at the player. It was also the first game where players were given multiple lives, had to repel hordes of enemies, could take cover from enemy fire, and use destructible barriers,in addition to being the first game to use a continuous background soundtrack, with four simple diatonic descending bass notes repeating in a loop, which was dynamic and changed pace during stages, like a heartbeat sound that increases pace as enemies approached.[CR]It also introduced the concept of a difficulty curve, with the aliens moving faster as the player kills more of them, making the game more difficult as it progresses. The game's concept of scaling difficulty became the basis for modern single-player video gaming.[CR]Cited by influential creators like Shigeru Miyamoto and Hideo Kojima as a major inspiration, Space Invaders revolutionized the industry following the video game crash of 1977 (brought on by a glut of Pong clones on the market and the departure of manufacturers like RCA and Fairchild). Proving that video games were capable of competing with movies, music and television, Space Invaders has since become recognized as one of the most influential games ever released. It was one of the first games to utilize the concept of a &#8220;high score,&#8221; and was the first to save the player&#8217;s score. It was the first shooter that allowed enemies to shoot back at the player, the first to give the player multiple lives and provide destructible cover against enemy fire. Its success effectively launched an entire genre of space shooters, including Atari&#8217;s Asteroids, Williams&#8217; Defender, and Namco&#8217;s Galaxian series.[CR]It moved the gaming industry away from Pong-inspired sports games grounded in real-world situations towards action games involving fantastical situations. Whittaker commented that Space Invaders helped action games become the most dominant genre on both arcades and consoles, through to contemporary times. Guinness World Records considered Space Invaders one of the most successful arcade shooting games by 2008. In describing it as a "seminal arcade classic", IGN listed it as the number eight "classic shoot 'em up". Space Invaders set the template for the shoot 'em up genre. Its worldwide success created a demand for a wide variety of science fiction games, inspiring the development of arcade games, such as Atari's Asteroids, Williams Electronic's Defender, and Namco's Galaxian and Galaga, which were modeled after Space Invaders' gameplay and design. This influence extends to most shooting games released to the present day, including first-person shooters such as Wolfenstein, Doom, Halo, and Call of Duty. Space Invaders also had an influence on early computer dungeon crawl games such as Dungeons of Daggorath, which used similar heartbeat sounds to indicate player health. Space Invaders' concept of a gradually increasing difficulty level also revolutionized the gaming industry.Remakes and sequelsSpace Invaders '95, one of many sequels[CR]Recent ports and remakes include Space Invaders Anniversary, released in 2003 for the PlayStation 2 and including nine variants of the core game. Space Invaders, Space Invaders Part II and Return of the Invaders were featured in the arcade compilation Taito Legends (released in 2005), and Space Invaders '91, Space Invaders '95, and Space Invaders DX were featured in Taito Legends 2 (released in 2006). A remake of the game called Space Invaders Extreme was released for the PSP and Nintendo DS in 2008 and on Xbox Live Arcade in 2009. A second remake, Space Invaders Infinity Gene, was released in 2009 on PlayStation Network, Xbox Live Arcade, and iOS devices.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Cheat Mode[CR]At the Main Menu and while highlighting Play, press Left, Left, Right, Right, Left, Right, Left, Right, Left, Left, Right, Right.

		<plot>The Burai, a race of evil super-brain aliens, have launched their plan to conquer the universe with their army of half-organic, half-robot creatures - the robo-mutants. It's up to the player to stop them! Strap on your jet pack, and get ready to become the ultimate Burai Fighter.[CR]Space Marauder is an scrolling shooter game with two modes of play. Most levels are side- and vertical-scrolling with pre-designed layouts. A few levels are different, though: top-down perspective, with a randomized layout. Either way, the player is armed with a variety of weapons, including different guns (laser, missile, ring) and the powerful cobalt bomb which kills everything on screen.[CR]Space Marauder is the Game Boy Color version of Burai Fighter. Game play is exactly the same. Like Burai Fighter it offers the same three difficulties (Eagle, Albatross and Ace), but the game features different level layouts. It doesn't include the Vs. mode.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Cheat Passwords &amp;amp; Stage Selection[CR]From the Main Menu, choose Password and enter one of the following:</plot>

		<title_clean>Spawn</title_clean>
		<plot>Based on the popular Todd McFarlane comic book, Spawn sends the titular hero through four stages of combat.  He must navigate various environmental obstacle while defeating enemies with his fists and guns.[CR]Spawn is a platformer with some shooter elements.  It contains both horizontal and vertical sections.  You must make your way through these and defeat the various thugs and occasional bosses.  Mostly, you'll be punching and kicking, but there are some guns with rather limited ammunition to find along the way.  There is also one stage where Spawn rids a motorcycle, somewhat along the lines of the surfing and skating levels in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.[CR]There are three difficulty modes.  In each mode, enemies can take more damage.  One punch will knock out any minor enemy in easy and you can start at any stage.  It takes two in normal and you must play through from stage one.  On hard, it takes several, so the fighting becomes much more strategic.  You must beat the game on hard mode to get the real ending.</plot>

		<title_clean>Star Wars Episode I - Racer</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Star Wars: Episode I - Racer is a fast paced anti-gravity racing game based on the infamous "Pod Race" from The Phantom Menace movie. The player can reach extremely high speeds and use quick reflexes to dodge oncoming racers and obstacles. The racer begins each of the three lap races with three lives, meaning that in contrast to the film crashing doesn't mean your race is over, but is more of a minor setback. Once the lives are all used up, however, the racer is disqualified. Alongside the home console (of which just the N64 version was published by Nintendo) and computer versions, a port for the Game Boy Color was released with entirely different tracks, but similar core gameplay. Of greater note is Star Wars: Racer Arcade (developed jointly by Sega AM5 [later renamed Sega Rosso] and Lucasarts), which put the public in the seat of Anakin Skywalker's Pod with a cockpit shaped control deck. Two levers were used to control the game, mirroring events in the film. There are only four tracks in the Arcade, many less than the other versions.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Note: While the characters are given individual backstories which show some to be inexperienced or unmotivated to seek victory, the game treats them all as dedicated and talented racers.[CR]Anakin Skywalker[CR]A hero from the film which the game is based on. Anakin is a young human, notable for being the only of his race capable of participating in the dangerous game of podracing.[CR]Sebulba[CR]Sebulba, a Dug, is a popular and successful racer who worked his way to the top by cheating. He is the only racer in the game to have a weapon. When using Sebulba's taunt, a flamethrower spouts out sideways.[CR]Bozzie Baranta[CR]Once a mechanic for Gasgano, Bozzie chose to become a racer. He was fairly successful in this venture.[CR]Aldar Beedo[CR]While Aldar Beedo is a talented racer, his first priority is his work as a hitman, taking out racers to pave the way to victory for whoever pays for his services.[CR]Toy Dampner[CR]Dampner is a menacing pilot. While he is known to race elsewhere, he prefers the tracks of Oovo IV, where he is a crowd favorite.[CR]Dud Bolt[CR]A racer hired by Sebulba who is paid per race based on how many competing pods he is able to take out.[CR]Gasgano[CR]An experienced and talented racer who does not hesitate to take out racers who get in his way.[CR]Mars Guo[CR]A loudmouth braggart with a fondness for gambling and drinking. While he is a competent racer, his tendency to anger other racers often leads to his downfall.[CR]Ebe Endocott[CR]Once a daredevil delivery man, Endocott was encouraged by his boss to take up podracing, where his daredevil ways and piloting skills let him achieve some success.[CR]Cy Yunga[CR]A talented racer with an advanced pod. Yunga is only available in-game through a cheat code, causing him to replace "Bullseye" Navior.[CR]Ratts Tyerell[CR]Ratts Tyerell is a racer who gained success for his swift reflexes. He owns one of the largest podracers in the circuit.[CR]Fud Sang[CR]A somewhat mediocre and unknown racer, who nevertheless is paranoid of being sabotaged by his opponents.[CR]Boles Roor[CR]A podracer who also excels at singing, Roor pilots an outdated podracer that nevertheless boasts a high top speed.[CR]Ark "Bumpy" Roose[CR]Roose is a particularly dim-witted pilot who is known for indiscriminately ramming into opposing racers.[CR]Wan Sandage[CR]Sandage is a podracer who gained a great deal of fame on his homeworld of Ord Radama. However, he is less successful on other planets, where he suffers from disorientation.[CR]Jinn Reeso[CR]Little is known about Jinn Reeso. He is only available for use through a cheat code, causing him to replace Mars Guo.[CR]Ben Quadinaros[CR]Quadinaros is an inexperienced racer, racing out of his league with an experimental four-engine pod.[CR]Slide Paramita[CR]Paramita is an elitist racer who uses a small pod. He disapproves of racers who use bulky podracers.[CR]Mawhonic[CR]A very talented racer who sells parts in his spare time.[CR]"Bullseye" Navior[CR]Navior is a talented pilot who gained the nickname "Bullseye" for his unique looking eyes.[CR]Teemto Pagalies[CR]Despite being a drunkard, Pagalies is one of the least corrupt racers in the sport. He is a crowd pleaser, known for performing daring stunts during races.[CR]Ody Mandrell[CR]Mandrell is a racer who participates not for money, but for an adrenaline rush. His tough skin lets him survive otherwise deadly crashes.[CR]Neva Kee[CR]Neva Kee stands out among the other racers for his unique podracer. Its engines are attached directly to the cockpit and jut out behind it. This makes the cockpit the frontmost part of the pod, greatly increasing the risk of death in a crash.[CR]Elan Mak[CR]Elan Mak is actually a bounty hunter named Kam Nale. He joined the podracing circuit in order to hunt down Aldar Beedo. When he discovered his talent for the sport, he became involved with it beyond his initial intention to only use it as a front to catch Beedo.[CR]Clegg Holdfast A reporter for Podracing Quarterly, Holdfast participates in races primarily in order to get an inside scoop. Despite his ulterior motives, he showed himself to be a talented racer.[CR][B]Modes:[/B][CR]N64, Dreamcast, PC and Mac Versions:[CR]There are four main modes within the game. The single player story mode, called "Tournament", is a sequence of championships of increasing difficulty composed of several races each in which the player competes for trophies. New tracks, racers and upgrades are unlocked by playing through it and Credits earned by winning races allows you to add new parts to your Pod. The difficulty level in Tournament mode can't be set. Free Race mode is essentially the exhibition mode in which players compete in single races but can't unlock rewards, however the level of the opponents' challenge can be determined. Time Attack is no different to any other mode with this name, as the player attempts to beat a track as quickly as possible. There is also a local two player mode, and the level and number of AI racers can be altered.[CR]Planets[CR]Tatooine[CR]Only two of the game's courses are found in Tatooine. The first is the Boonta Training Course, an easy map that acquaints players with the game. The second is the Boonta Classic, which is a relatively faithful recreation of the racetrack from the movie.[CR]Mon Gazza[CR]Mon Gazza is a Mars-like world with vast red deserts, crowded but small cities, and lava pits. Tracks here often involve large open spaces that quickly turn to narrow corridors.[CR]Ando Prime[CR]Ando Prime is an ice world. Tracks here take players through numerous caves, and often take them across slick, icy surfaces. Many tracks in this world feature a shortcut that opens up in laps 2 and on, in which the racer may turn left immediately past the finish line and enter a tent that hides a tunnel.[CR]Aquilaris[CR]Aquilaris is composed largely of water, and its tracks take place largely in the infrastructure built on the water. Players are taken through underwater tunnels through which massive fish may be seen.[CR]Malastare[CR]Malastare is a dark world with many sharp turns and visual obstructions such as gas and rocky pillars. Tracks here are narrow and unforgiving.[CR]Baroonda[CR]Baroonda is a jungle world. Players race through a variety of environments here, including thick rain forests, beaches, and a volcano.[CR]Ord Ibanna[CR]Racetracks on Ord Ibanna are all located on infrastructure floating in a cloudy sky. These tracks often feature elevated shortcuts that are difficult to stay on because they are narrow.[CR]Oovo IV[CR]Oovo IV is a large, asteroid-like world. Players race through open expanses along with urban areas. The highest speeds achievable in the game are found here in anti-gravity tunnels.[CR]Track Overview[CR]There are several tracks on each of the available planets, and every racer has at least one signature track. There are 25 tracks in total, divided into four categories: Amatuer, Semi-Pro, Galactic, and Invitational.Tracks in order of appearance:[CR]Boonta Training Course[CR]Planet - Tatooine[CR]Circuit - Amateur[CR]Advantage - SebulbaPod Racing![CR]Mon Gazza Speedway[CR]Planet - Mon Gazza[CR]Circuit - Amateur[CR]Advantage - Teemto Pagalies[CR]Beedo's Wild Ride[CR]Planet - Ando Prime[CR]Circuit - Amateur[CR]Advantage - Aldar Beedo[CR]Aquilaris Classic[CR]Planet - Aquilaris[CR]Circuit - Amateur[CR]Advantage - Clegg Holdfast[CR]Malastare 100[CR]Planet - Malastare[CR]Circuit - Amateur[CR]Advantage - Dud Bolt[CR]Vengeance[CR]Planet - Oovo IV[CR]Circuit - Amateur[CR]Advantage - Fud Sang[CR]Spice Mine Run[CR]Planet - Mon Gazza[CR]Circuit - Amateur[CR]Advantage - Mars Guo / Jinn Reeso[CR]Sunken City[CR]Planet - Aquilaris[CR]Circuit - Semi-Pro[CR]Advantage - "Bullseye" Navior / Cy Yunga[CR]Howler Gorge[CR]Planet - Ando Prime[CR]Circuit - Semi-Pro[CR]Advantage - Ratts Tyerell[CR]Dug Derby[CR]Planet - Malastare[CR]Circuit - Semi-Pro[CR]Advantage - Elan MakMore Pod Racing![CR]Scrapper's Run[CR]Planet - Ord Ibanna[CR]Circuit - Semi-Pro[CR]Advantage - Wan Sandage[CR]Zugga Challenge[CR]Planet - Mon Gazza[CR]Circuit - Semi-Pro[CR]Advantage - Boles Roor[CR]Baroo Coast[CR]Planet - Baroonda[CR]Circuit - Semi-Pro[CR]Advantage - Neva Kee[CR]Bumpy's Breakers[CR]Planet - Aquilaris[CR]Circuit - Semi-Pro[CR]Advantage - Ark "Bumpy" Roose[CR]Executioner[CR]Planet - Oovo IV[CR]Circuit - Galactic[CR]Advantage - Toy Dampner[CR]Sebulba's Legacy[CR]Planet - Malastare[CR]Circuit - Galactic[CR]Advantage - Sebulba[CR]Grabvine Gateway[CR]Planet - Baroonda[CR]Circuit - Galactic[CR]Advantage - Anakin Skywalker[CR]Andobi Mountain Run[CR]Planet - Ando Prime[CR]Circuit - Galactic[CR]Advantage - Mawhonic[CR]Dethro's Revenge[CR]Planet - Ord Ibanna[CR]Circuit - Galactic[CR]Advantage - Ody Mandrell[CR]Fire Mountain Rally[CR]Planet - Baroonda[CR]Circuit - Galactic[CR]Advantage - Ebe Endocott[CR]Boonta Classic[CR]Planet - Tatooine[CR]Circuit - Galactic[CR]Advantage - Sebulba[CR]Ando Prime Centrum[CR]Planet - Ando Prime[CR]Circuit - Invitational[CR]Advantage - Slide Paramita[CR]Abyss[CR]Planet - Ord Ibanna[CR]Circuit - Invitational[CR]Advantage - Bozzie Baranta[CR]The Gauntlet[CR]Planet - Oovo IV[CR]Circuit - Invitational[CR]Advantage - Gasgano[CR]Inferno[CR]Planet - Baroonda[CR]Circuit - Invitational[CR]Advantage - Ben Quadinaros[CR]Even though the planets host multiple races, it does not mean that those races are at all similar.[CR]Attribute Overview[CR]Each pod has 15 total attributes that determine its racing performance. You can buy parts for them, but you can only affect 7 total attributes by doing so. The others are set in stone for each unique pod.Upgradeable Attributes:[CR]Repair Rate - Affects the speed at which the pod repairs its damage.[CR]How to Upgrade - Buy some REPAIR parts.[CR]Best Part: Cluster 2 Power Plug 7,000[CR]Cool Rate - Affects the speed at which the pod cools down just after using your boost.[CR]How to Upgrade - Buy some COOLING parts.[CR]Best Part: Turbo Coolant Pump 5,400[CR]Airbrake Inverse - Affects the speed at which a pod can slow itself[CR]How to Upgrade - Buy some BRAKING parts.[CR]Best Part: Quadrijet Air Brake 14,000[CR]Maximum Speed - Affects your top speed.[CR]How to Upgrade - Buy some MAX SPEED upgrades.[CR]Best Part: Block 6 Thrust Coil 20,000[CR]Acceleration - Affects the rate at which a pod can achieve its top speed[CR]How to Upgrade - Buy some ACCELERATION upgrades.[CR]Best Part: Mag 6 Injector 14,000[CR]Turn Response - Affects the speed at which a pod reacts to steering commands.[CR]How to Upgrade - Buy some TURNING upgrades.[CR]Best Part: Control Stabilizer 7,500[CR]Anti-Skid - Affects the ability of the pod to stay on course during a hazardous race or through a sharp turn.[CR]How to Upgrade - Buy some TRACTION upgrades.[CR]Best Part: R-600 Repulsorgirp 6,000Non-Upgradeable Attributes:[CR]Maximum Turn Rate - How good a pod can turn.[CR]Deceleration Inverse - The rate at which a pod will slow down without applying brakes.[CR]Boost Thrust - Dictates how fast a pod can go during a boost.[CR]Heat Rate - How fast a pod overheats.[CR]Hover Height - How high a pod sits in the air whilst idling.[CR]Bump Mass - Dictates how much damage your pod deals during a collision.[CR]Damage Immunity - Your pod's ability to resist damage during collisions.[CR]Intersect Radius - The size of your pod.

		<title_clean>Super Mario Bros. Deluxe</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR]The Original Super Mario Bros.[CR]Super Mario Bros. Deluxe is nearly identical to the original Super Mario Bros. experience on the NES. None of the levels were modified in any way from the original set, at least when played through the first time. New to this version, you can save anytime onto one of three separate accounts and there are simple overworld maps depicting each of the eight worlds. As a new feature, the Photo album is comparable to a modern Achievements system, awarding small pictures or vignettes that can be printed on a Game Boy Printer. Also, the game now includes a battery pack powered leaderboard, making the points system from the original game matter. The Gameboy Color's screen is not as wide as that of the original NES's display, so developers compensated for this by allowing the player to go back a short distance, press up or down to look around or press Select to recenter camera. Those points aside, the game is a dead ringer.[CR]Star Mode[CR]When you finish the original game the first time, a new star designation goes beside your save account and the game starts over with some variations to make the game more difficult. For example, in star mode, all of the Goombas are replaced with Buzzy Beetles and all floating platforms are considerably shortened. The effects of this mode do not consistently increase the difficulty (unchanged enemies pose no more a threat than before) but completion does prove much more challenging for platforming-intensive stages. When you beat the game on Star Mode, the game lets you choose which level to play and on what mode in the account selection screen.[CR]Super Mario Bros: The Lost Levels[CR]Other than the main game, the Japanese version of Super Mario Bros. 2 (aka The Lost Levels) is in this release, named Super Mario Bros. For Super Players. To access the levels, you have to beat the default high score in the leaderboards that are held by Luigi in the main game. The format of Lost Levels is nearly identical to the original Mario Bros mechanically and graphically but it is designed to be far more difficult than its predecessor (it's also much more difficult than Star Mode). In addition to demanding better timing and greater levels of finesse, the game actively tries to trick the player with bogus secrets and red herrings, the most notorious of which is a warp zone that takes the player back to World 1 from later Worlds. Lost Levels is also the relatively obscure debut of the Poison Mushroom which will harm Mario when touched. As with the Super Nintendo version, the game removes the final 9th and A to D worlds, and differences in gameplay between Mario and Luigi.[CR]Challenge Mode[CR]One of the new modes is a challenge mode where each of the original 32 levels have special items hidden in them for Mario to find. The player can choose any level they have beaten on a save in the original game. Challenge Mode has three goals for each level: finding five special red coins, finding the Yoshi egg, and achieving a score by the end (determined by the development team). There is only one Challenge Mode account and it can be reset if desired.[CR]You vs. Boo[CR]Another new mode is a versus mode either against Luigi or Boo in a race to the flag. This can be done either as a singleplayer to two-player game with a link cable. The objective is to dodge a level full of obstacles, traps, and hazards to beat your opponent to the flag. There are eight levels to choose from and though they are graphically similar to the original game, none of the level designs are taken from the original. Each map has a series of buttons that players can hit to change the status of certain blocks, altering their existence or spikiness. There are two states the buttons toggle and one is beneficial to each contestant, striking a balance between making sure the layout is ideal and just gunning for the flag.[CR]Boo is your opponent when playing against the computer and he simply floats by at a constant rate in the background instead of being blocked by obstacles, making these much more of a race against the clock than the multiplayer version. However, the computer will switch the state of the blocks in the level at a fairly constant rate, so this danger is not averted.[CR]Toad's Toy Box[CR]Every time the player makes significant progress in a mode or in the original game, things open up in Toad's Toy Box. The calendar, is just a basic calendar showing the current date, but goes on from 1 AD to 3000 AD, and has some filled out dates such as the original Japanese release date for Super Mario Bros. The fortune teller just shows a random item and a small fortune text like a fortune cookie, and occasionally a Super Fortune, awarding 5 extra lives in all games. The "?" room gets filled with Toads as you rescue them in the game, playing out little animations and unlocking more pictures printable via the GameBoy Printer. The last ones open up a simple music creator similar to Mario Paint, and you can redo the iconic opening music. "Where's Yoshi?" section is a randomized hint machine that will choose random levels and show the approximate location of the Yoshi Egg in them for Challenge Mode.[CR]Secrets[CR]Start a game with 10 lives instead of 5[CR]To start a game with 10 lives (new file), go to the toy box, and select the fortune teller option. Now pick a card. Keep on picking until you get an "Extremely Lucky" card, and you should see a 5-Up on the card.[CR]now you can start a game with 10 instead of 5 lives.[CR]</plot>

		<title_clean>Survival Kids</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Released on the       Game Boy Color in 1999, Survival Kids was fairly impressive both for its time and its platform. The open-ended nature of the game wasn't often seen on early portable gaming systems.  It would be easy to draw comparisons between this game and products from other mediums such as LOST and Castaway. Stranded on a mysterious island, there is very little interaction with any other living creatures, other than those you hunt. You can, however, befriend a monkey fairly early on, if you're desperate for humanoid companionship.  The game had very little storyline to speak of, but it did have a wide variety of endings. These endings were extremely varied, and included various methods of escaping from the island and either dying in your attempt to reach civilization, or safely making it home. You could also opt to not escape and to stay on the island, in which case the game could continue forever, becoming a sort of deserted island      Harvest Moon.  While the first sequel, Survival Kids 2, was only released in Japan, the series continued onto the     Nintendo DS and the    Wii, though the series saw a name change to   Lost in Blue outside of Japan.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Big Berry Game[CR]Go to the Big Berry Tree (after the river, near where you get the big stick) when you have the monkey and check it to play for the Big Berry.

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Released on the       Game Boy Color in 1999, Survival Kids was fairly impressive both for its time and its platform. The open-ended nature of the game wasn't often seen on early portable gaming systems.  It would be easy to draw comparisons between this game and products from other mediums such as LOST and Castaway. Stranded on a mysterious island, there is very little interaction with any other living creatures, other than those you hunt. You can, however, befriend a monkey fairly early on, if you're desperate for humanoid companionship.  The game had very little storyline to speak of, but it did have a wide variety of endings. These endings were extremely varied, and included various methods of escaping from the island and either dying in your attempt to reach civilization, or safely making it home. You could also opt to not escape and to stay on the island, in which case the game could continue forever, becoming a sort of deserted island      Harvest Moon.  While the first sequel, Survival Kids 2, was only released in Japan, the series continued onto the     Nintendo DS and the    Wii, though the series saw a name change to   Lost in Blue outside of Japan.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Big Berry Game[CR]Go to the Big Berry Tree (after the river, near where you get the big stick) when you have the monkey and check it to play for the Big Berry. [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Big Berry Game[CR]To get the egg game, go in the desert, near the ashes up north with a monkey to play the Egg Catcher mini game.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Big Berry Game[CR]Go near the main river and take the big rock. After getting it, USE it where you see fish to play the fishing mini game.[CR]</plot>

Authentic cars and several other tracks round out the experience.[CR]Same Name, Different Game[CR]The PC and Playstation versions were released in March 2000 and developed by Eutechnyx. The Dreamcast game, though still published by Infogrames, was developed from scratch by Melbourne House and released in November 2000. The Dreamcast version has two fewer tracks, lacking the Road Atlanta and Road Atlanta National courses.[CR]In 2001, Melbourne House developed a port of the Dreamcast game for the PS2. This version was also ported to the PC in 2002, under the name "Le Mans 24 Hours", by Torus. This name had been used for all markets outside North America for the previous games.[CR]</plot>

		<title_clean>Tintin in Tibet</title_clean>
		<plot>Tintin au Tibet was first released on SNES and Genesis  before making its way to the Game Boy Color.  It was developed and published by Atari and follows the plot of the comic.  [CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Tintin au Tibet tells the same story as the Tintin au Tibet comic written by Herge.  It follows the adventures of young, Belgian reporter Tintin and his friends Captain Haddock and Professor Tournesol.  While Tintin and his friends are vacationing in a Swiss mountain resort, they get news about a plane crash in Tibet. Tintin starts having dreams of his friend Tchang, stranded in the Himalayas, calling for help. The next day, he receives a letter from Tchang confirming the fact that he was indeed on the doomed flight  and Tintin decides to go to the crash site to see once and for all if his friend is really dead.  Tintin and Haddock go to Kathmandu and meet with Tharkey, a sherpa, who initially refuses to bring them to the crash site. After Haddock changes his mind, Tharkey, Tintin, Haddock, and a support team decide to climb to where the plane crashed.  Their adventure doesn't go as smoothly as they thought it would.  First, Tintin's dog Milou almost drowns and then the support team abandons them because they're afraid of the Yeti.  They finally make it to where the plane crashed.  They find proof that Tchang survived the accident, but  he is nowhere to be found.  Tintin is about to give up when he finds his friend's scarf and decides to follow this new trail.  After narrowly avoiding a lethal avalanche, they find a Buddhist monastery. One of the monks has a supernatural power and is able to locate Tchang, who's been in the Yeti's cave and was taken care of by the Yeti. Tintin reunites with his friend and leaves the cave.  The game's cut scenes were actually parts of the animated series Tintin au Tibet that was released at about the same time as the game.    [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Tintin au Tibet is a platformer.  The player controls Tintin and must jump around multiple levels that range from a train station all the way to top of the Himalaya. Tintin can get hurt by a lot of things in the game's universe: butlers, bells, cows and even random people.  The gameplay tries to recreate some of the famous scenes from the comic.  In the scene where Milou almost drowns, the player must swim to go get him.  The game has the player climbing and sometimes sliding around the different levels.  The game was also known for its difficulty and the fact that the codes given the player only worked every five levels.

They can be defeated with different types of balls that Buster has at his disposal (football, soccer and baseball), that vary in their behaviour. The Baseball travels at slow speeds horizontally and explodes if it hits walls. It stuns all enemies close to the explosion. The Soccer Balls bounces of the floor and is bound by gravity, meaning that it will drop of edges etc. The Football travels very quickly and diagonally bounces of everything for a set amount of time. Soccerball and Football 'kill' with direct hits.[CR]Progress is tracked via a password feature and the story is told via cut scenes.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Last Stage Password[CR]At the password screen put the pictures in the following order: [CR]Max, Buster, Babs, Dizzy.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Last Stage Password[CR]At the password screen set it:</plot>

		<title_clean>Toki Tori</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The game's logo.[CR]Toki Tori is a puzzle-platformer, originally released on September 12, 2001 and was originally published by Capcom. The title was met with poor sales, although it received generally positive reviews.[CR]A remake with new levels was released on WiiWare as a downloadable game. The game was priced at 1000 Wii Points ($10) in North America and 900 Wii Points ($9) in Europe. The remake included new levels, enhanced graphics, cooperative play, and more. An iPhone version of the remake was released in May 2009 with bonus levels not included in the Wii version.[CR]On January 29th, 2010 the game was released on Steam. This PC-version includes several new levels and content, and 37 Steam-achievements.[CR]The original Game Boy Color version was made available on the 3DS eShop (in the US) on August 30, 2012.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]A screenshot from the PC version.[CR]The goal of Toki Tori is simple: Collect all of the eggs scattered around the levels using whatever abilities you have been given.[CR]Toki Tori is able to run around, climb ladders, jump half block distances and survive any drop by flapping his wings, however only by utilising powers such as a freeze gun to disable enemies, the bridge tool to build across gaps, a teleport power to move past some walls, can he avoid the many dangers and collect all of the eggs in each level.[CR]However Toki is limited in how many of each power he can use, this is where the game becomes challenging and requires the player to think carefully about what powers they use at what time, as many times a player may run out of the necessary ability as they come within 3 blocks of the final egg, forcing the player to restart the level again.[CR]The puzzles take Toki Tori through a variety of worlds, ranging from lush, colorful jungles to underground sewage systems, crawling with slugs, to the ocean, where frozen enemies float to the top of the levels.[CR]Skills / Abilities[CR]In order to solve the many puzzle the game has to offer, Toki Tori has 8 different abilities at his disposal, all of which having a limited number of uses per level, depending on the level itself.Bridge[CR]This item will allow Toki Tori to build a section of bridge right in front of him, thus allowing him to move over gaps-- you cannot build bridges too near to lava.Telewarp[CR]A basic teleport; Toki Tori can be moved into a nearby space, given there is room for him there and that the covered distance meets the ability's limited reach. The Teleport can move Toki Tori up or down, left or right.Freeze-O-Matic[CR]The Freese-O-Matic is a weapon to be used against enemies-- as the name hints, firing this gun will freeze foes into an ice cube. The player must however be aware that these ice cubes are not movable and they will never unmelt, so they can really block your passage.Brick Switch[CR]Certain sets of bricks that are blocking your way can be move, as long as Toki Tori uses this ability-- Toki Tori will grab a stack of bricks directly in front of him and will drop them right behind him.Ghost Trap[CR]Toki Tori will place a magical trap on the ground beneath him-- if a Ghost walks over the trap it immediately falls right through the floor, taking any blocks with it, leaving a hole and possible passage to what used to be an unreachable area. The Ghost Trap only works on brick floors, though, never on wood.Slug Sucker[CR]Any Slugs in your way can either be removed or redirected with the Slug Sucker-- you can change a Slug's direction by standing behind it and quickly pressing the ability key/button; this will make the Slug turn towards you. If you press the ability key/button for a longer period of time, you will instead suck the Slug into your Slug Sucker and remove it from the level.[CR]Note: you will only use up this item when the Slug is sucked all the way into the sucker; changing a Slug's direction will not consume the ability.Instant Rock[CR]Toki Tori will throw a small pebble in the space directly in front of him; as soon as it touches the ground it will instantly grow into a large square stone. This can be used to fill gaps in the ground or simply to gain access to higher platforms.Bubble Suit[CR]Use this suit to float underwater. This ability is only hindered by its limited number of moves, but these can be refilled by using bubble sources. You can move up or down and left or right. Once you have used your last move the bubble will burst. This ability can be used to move across gaps or reach higher platforms.[CR]System Requirements for PC[CR]OS: Windows XP, Vista, or Windows 7Processor: Intel Pentium 4 / AMD Athlon XP 1.5 Ghz or higherMemory: 1 GB RAM (Vista), 512mb (XP)Graphics: DirectX 9 compatible, 128MB VRAMDirectX: DirectX 9.0cHard Drive: 200 MB of free space[CR]</plot>

		<title_clean>Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Summary:[/B][CR]Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six in a 1998 video game based on the novel bearing the same name by author Tom Clancy. The video game shares many themes with the novel, including a heavy emphasis on terrorism and anti-terrorism, covert operations, and international politics. Rainbow Six has been ported to many consoles following its original PC release. Depending on the console, Rainbow Six is played in either a first-person or third-person perspective, allowing players to take the role of a covert anti-terrorist heading into action and giving commands to teammates in order to tactically defeat the enemy. The PC version was developed and published by Red Storm Entertainment, except in Europe where it was published by Ubisoft.  [CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Team Rainbow is an elite international group of anti-terrorist experts, covertly sent on missions around the world in an attempt to smother out the flames of rising terrorism. The team is often assigned hostage rescue missions from director John Clark, during the course of which Rainbow is alerted to the actions of a radial terrorist organization the Phoenix Group. [CR]During several mission infiltrating the many bases of operation for the Phoenix Group, team Rainbow successfully gathers intelligence from the Phoenix Group&#8217;s biological research facility. It is revealed that the terrorist organization is planning to unleash a biological weapon at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia. [CR]Team Rainbow immediately prepares to infiltrate the large underground network of the Olympic Village, seeking the location of the weapon, and thwarting the Phoenix Group&#8217;s plans. The Rainbow Team concludes it&#8217;s mission against the Phoenix Group by entering the group&#8217;s main facilities, resembling an ecosphere for botanical and viral research. Team Rainbow successfully incapacitates the enemy leader, taking out a major threat to world peace.  [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The gameplay in Rainbow Six forces players to strictly plan each mission, examining every tactical angle before thrown into action. Levels are prefaced with briefings that provide the player with a map of the area, suspected locations of terrorists and hostages, and entry and exit points. The player is encouraged to plot their own waypoints on the map, while choosing different alert status for the team (i.e, &#8220;escort&#8221; or &#8220;engage&#8221;). However, stock execution plans are available in the player chooses to bypass the planning stage. [CR]Four teams are at disposal to the player, one of which is in direct control through either first person or third person view. Sixteen individual members comprise Rainbow Six, each of which can be either promoted or assigned to different color coded teams, such as Gold, Red, Blue and Green. [CR]Once the mission has begun, players have access to the wide range of weapons chose during planning. For example, flashbangs temporarily debilitate enemies, which is the player&#8217;s advantage when approaching guarded hostages. The player also has the ability to advance other teams in the field, either by switching the control and view to a different colored team, or executing Go-Codes such as &#8220;Advance&#8221; or &#8220;Hold Position.&#8221; [CR]When a team member of Rainbow is incapacitated by the enemy, vital signs display the status of the downed member. If a member has been killed, he or she will be unavailable for the roster for the remainder of the game. Incapacitated members must wait to recover at least one following mission before returning to action.  [CR][B]Multiplayer:[/B][CR]Rainbow Six is notable for it&#8217;s online multiplayer during a time when internet gaming was in its early stages. Many maps were multiplayer specific for the PC, such as City Street Large, a training level.  [CR]Multiplayer on the console was limited to split screen co-op gameplay. Each player controlled one of the colored Rainbow teams, coordinating infiltration of dangerous areas and evacuation of multiple hostages.   [CR]Different Versions[CR]The Nintendo 64 version made use of nearly every button on the controller, forcing players to constantly switch between the middle and left handle. Aiming was controlled with the analog stick, for example, while reloading was designated to the left shoulder button. The Nintendo 64 version received both criticism and praise for this control scheme, as critics cited the layout&#8217;s awkwardness, while the positive reviews noted a parallel to real world actions. It was developed by Saffire. The Dreamcast version was developed by Pipe Dream Interactive and published by Majesco. The Game Boy Color version was developed by Crawfish Interactive and published by South Peak.    [CR]PC Requirements[CR] Windows 95/98; Pentium 166 (Min.), Pentiom 200 (Rec.); 4x CD-ROM drive (Min.); 16Mb RAm (Min.), 32 MB (Rec.); 16-bit SVGA or better (2D video); Direct 3D compatible hardware acceleration reccomended; Soundblaster 16 compatible; 100MB free hard drive space; Mouse &amp; Keyboard.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Tonic Trouble is based on the Rayman series; it is a traditional 3D platformer. Released August 31 1999, and released on the N64, PC and GBC. Developed by Ubisoft Montreal, RFX Interactive (GBC version), published and distributed by Ubisoft.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The premise of the story is that Ed the main protagonist finds a weird liquid substance which in turn he decides to drink, but it tastes terrible. So Ed throws the strange liquid away, after which it manages to come to earth where it is stumbled upon by a man named Gr&#246;gh.[CR]Gr&#246;gh comes to enjoy the power (making man made or organic objects come to life) of this strange substance. Ed&#8217;s superiors find out about this and order Ed to travel to earth and bring back the substance with the help of a scientist and his daughter, Doc and Suzie. Ed eventually navigates his way to Gr&#246;gh&#8217;s castle where he defeats him and obtains the substance.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Tonic Trouble is similar to the Rayman series, where you travel around levels eventually concluding with a boss battle after which the level concludes. Control mechanics for Tonic Trouble a poorly designed as well as the game itself, for the reason that it was ported from the PC to the N64 which led to poor rendering during gameplay and cut scenes.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR] Agent Ed : Ed is an alien; good but a little bit stupid. He has to repair his disaster. He is voiced by David Gasman. Suzy : She is the daughter of the Doc and Ed's girlfriend. She is helping Ed in his adventure. The Doc : Once free, the Doc helps Ed to go to Gr&#246;gh's Castle to get his can back by inventing a machine. Gr&#246;gh : Gr&#246;gh is the main antagonist of the game, he is now the master around the world and Ed must stop his reign. Agent Xyz : Another character who helps Ed; this is a newspaper guy who explains to Ed how to get through his adventure.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]History:[/B][CR]Tony Hawk, pulling off a sick kickflip 50 feet in the air.[CR]Tony Hawk's Pro Skater (known in most European regions as Tony Hawk's Skateboarding) is a skateboarding game developed by Neversoft and published by Activision for the PlayStation on September 30, 1999. The first game in the long-running Tony Hawk franchise, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater brings real skateboarders (such as Tony Hawk and Bob Burnquist), signature skateboarding brands (including real skateboard decals), and easier accessibility into the scarcely-populated skateboarding video game genre.[CR]The game was ported to the Nintendo 64 on February 29, 2000 (ported by Edge of Reality and published by Activision), the Dreamcast on June 29, 2000 (ported by Treyarch and published by Crave), and the N-Gage on October 23, 2003 (ported by Ideaworks and published by Nokia). The Nintendo 64 version is known for its censorship of both blood and vulgar song lyrics (granting it an "E" rating by the ESRB, as opposed to the original "T" rating). Most of the assets of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater is included in both Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2x for the Xbox and Tony Hawk's Pro Skater HD for the Xbox 360 (via Xbox Live Arcade), PlayStation 3 (via PlayStation Network), and PC (via Steam).[CR]A separate game was released on the Game Boy Color on March 2000 (developed by Natsume and published by Activision) featuring elements from the console versions but focused on skating on a half pipe in a side angle (Half Pipe Mode) and racing opponents in an overhead angle (1on1 Vs. CPU Mode).[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]In Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, players control their skater as they participate in two-minute runs (one-minute for special "competition" runs) where they complete specific goals in that time (such as earning a large score count by performing tricks and collecting symbols scattered around the level).ControlsGetting huge air off a ramp while performing a Grab Trick.[CR]Players steer their skater with the D-Pad and jump by pressing the Jump button. Holding down the Jump button while on the ground causes the skater to crouch down, increasing their speed. While in the air, they can hold down a direction on the D-Pad and either press the Flip button to perform a Flip Trick (simple tricks that can be easily chained with other tricks) or hold down the Grab button to perform a Grab Trick (tricks that can be held constantly for more points).[CR]Holding down a different direction on the D-Pad performs a different Flip or Grab Trick, which changes the point value of the trick (inversely proportional to the time required to execute the trick). Some advanced Flip Tricks can be held like Grab Tricks. If the player attempts to hit (or land on) a surface while a trick is in effect, the skater bails.[CR]Also, while in the air, they can spin around by holding left on the D-Pad, right on the D-Pad, or either shoulder button, increasing the point value (for every 180-degree spins) of the trick in effect (also adding points for simple jumps). However, landing with the skateboard in the wrong position causes the skater to bail.[CR]While in the air and close to a grindable edge (such as rails), they can press the Grind button to perform a Grind Trick (which lets them travel along the edge, earning points along the way). If they are close to a wall, they can press the Grind button to Wall Ride off the wall (earning points while increasing the skater's height). In both cases, they can press the Jump button to perform another jump. Pressing Up on the D-Pad and pressing the Grind button approaching straight on a halfpipe lip performs a Handplant.[CR]After a trick is successfully executed, they can perform another trick, adding onto the current combo chain (adding to the overall point value of the chain while increasing the chain's score multiplier). The score derived from the chain is added to the overall score counter if the skater lands successfully on the ground. The score is lost completely if the skater bails at any time. Extra points can be added to the chain by collecting special pickups, and hitting Gaps (hidden locational points reached by performing a specific jump, grinding specific edges, and interacting with specific objects).[CR]As the player lands more chains, their Special meter increases. Once the meter reaches its maximum capacity, the bar flashes yellow, allowing players to perform special Signature Moves (flashy Grab, Flip, and Grind Tricks that give a lot of points when successfully executed). When the bar is flashing yellow, it slowly depletes (and stops flashing yellow when the meter fully depletes). The meter fully depletes at any time when the skater bails.[CR]Holding Up on the D-Pad while jumping performs a Nollie, and double-tapping Up on the D-Pad while jumping performs a Fastplant, each adding points during the jump. Players can also perform a Nollie by pressing either shoulder button on the ground (switching their stance) and pressing the Jump button.Game Modes and Objectives[CR]Tony Hawk's Pro Skater includes three single-player game modes (Career, Single Session, and Free Skate) and three multiplayer game modes for up to two players locally (Graffiti, Trick Attack, and HORSE). Levels, skaters, and boards can only be unlocked by playing through Career Mode (or by cheat codes).[CR]Career Mode is the single-player campaign, as players lead one of the ten standard skaters (and two unlockable skaters) through all nine levels, unlocking new levels, skaters, and boards by collecting videotapes and winning competitions. Each standard level has five videotapes to collect, each by completing a specific objective in one run:Achieving the level's High Score.Colliding or grinding with five level-specific objects.Finding and collecting five letters (S-K-A-T-E) scattered throughout the level.Finding a videotape pickup somewhere hidden in the level.Achieving the level's Sick Score (which is larger than the High Score).[CR]Three levels "competition" levels, in which players are ranked (by score) in three one-minute runs. The best two runs are averaged out and compared against the competition, and the player wins by placing in the top three.[CR]Along with Career Mode, players can play Single Session, which are simple two-minute runs with the only objective of obtaining the highest score of each level, and Free Skate, which allow players to freely roam each level with no time limit or objectives.[CR]Two players can play competitively in three multiplayer modes: Graffiti, Trick Attack, and HORSE. Grafitti and Trick Attack are split-screen simultaneous multiplayer, while HORSE is single-screen alternating multiplayer. In Grafitti, both players race against the clock to "paint" the level by performing tricks on objects. The player with the most objects painted wins. In Trick Attack, both players race the clock to achieve the highest score. The player with the highest score wins. In HORSE, players alternate ten-second turns to land a higher scoring chain than the previous one. If a player fails to land a higher score, then he/she gets a letter penalty and the required score resets. If the player gets the maximum letter penalty (making up a word, such as H-O-R-S-E), then the other player wins the game. (If the player fails to land a chain and the previous score is zero, then he/she does not get a penalty) A custom word can be chosen at the beginning of the game.[CR][B]Levels:[/B][CR]The game includes nine fictional levels (located in the United States) to skate on, each level consisting of either skate parks or other urban environments.WarehouseWarehouse[CR](Woodland Hills, CA)[CR]Career High Score: 5,000 points.[CR]Career Sick Score: 15,000 points.[CR]Career Level Objective: Collide with five sets of boxes.SchoolSchool[CR](Miami, FL)[CR]Career High Score: 7,500 points.[CR]Career Sick Score: 15,000 points.[CR]Career Level Objective: Grind five lunch tables.MallMall[CR](New York City, NY)[CR]Career High Score: 10,000 points.[CR]Career Sick Score: 30,000 points.[CR]Career Level Objective: Break five mall directories.Skate ParkSkate Park[CR](Chicago, IL)[CR]Competition Level.DowntownDowntown[CR](Minneapolis, MN)[CR]Career High Score: 15,000 points.[CR]Career Sick Score: 40,000 points.[CR]Career Level Objective: Break five "No Skating" signs.Downhill JamDownhill Jam[CR](Phoenix, AZ)[CR]Career High Score: 20,000 points.[CR]Career Sick Score: 40,000 points.[CR]Career Level Objective: Open five water valves.BurnsideBurnside[CR](Portland, OR)[CR]Competition Level.StreetsStreets[CR](San Francisco, CA)[CR]Career High Score: 25,000 points.[CR]Career Sick Score: 50,000 points.[CR]Career Level Objective: Wreck five cop cars.RoswellRoswell[CR](Roswell, New Mexico)[CR]Competition Level.[CR]Playable Skaters[CR]Tony Hawk[CR]Style: Vert (goofy stance)Tony Hawk[CR]Ollie: &gt;&gt;&gt;[CR]Speed: &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;[CR]Air: &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;[CR]Balance: &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;[CR]Signature Moves:360 Flip to Mute (1500 points) - Down, Down + Flip.540 Board Varial (2000 points) - Left, Left + Flip.Kickflip McTwist (4000 points) - Right, Right + Grab.The 900 (8000 points) - Right, Down + Grab.Bob Burnquist[CR]Style: VertBob Burnquist[CR]Ollie: &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;[CR]Speed: &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;[CR]Air: &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;[CR]Balance: &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;[CR]Signature Moves:One-Footed Smith (grind, minimum 750 points) - Right, Right + Grind.Backflip (4000 points) - Up, Down + Grab.Burntwist (5000 points) - Left, Up + Grind.

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]New ground moves in Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2.[CR]Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 is a skateboarding game developed by Neversoft and published by Activision for the PlayStation on September 20, 2000. Sequel to Tony Hawk's Pro Skater and the second installment of the long-running Tony Hawk franchise, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 adds new skaters and levels while introducing new gameplay elements (such as new Grind Tricks and the Manual, an on-ground trick that allows players to continue trick chains while on the ground), a character creation system, and a level editor to the series. The game also includes an improved career mode, raising the number of objectives per level while replacing the "collecting videotape" system with a currency system (in which players can buy upgrades with cash collected, while new levels are unlocked by the total cash collected).[CR]The game was ported to the PC on October 31, 2000 (by LTI Gray Matter), the Dreamcast on November 6, 2000 (by Treyarch), the Nintendo 64 on August 21, 2001 (by Edge of Reality), and all iOS devices on April 2010 (by Activision). The PC version adds three levels from the predecessor, while the Nintendo 64 version replaced Chopper Drop with the Hoffman BMX Factory from Mat Hoffman's Pro BMX and removed some of the soundtrack (likely to reduce the ESRB rating from "T" to "E"). An updated version of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 was later released for the Xbox on November 14, 2001 (by Treyarch) titled Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2x (remaking all levels from the first two Tony Hawk games while adding four-player split-screen and system link multiplayer and gender selection in the character creation mode). Most of the assets of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 is included Tony Hawk's Pro Skater HD for the Xbox 360 (via Xbox Live Arcade), PlayStation 3 (via PlayStation Network), and PC (via Steam).[CR]Handheld versions were released on both the Game Boy Color on November 2000 (developed by Natsume) and the Game Boy Advance on May 30, 2001 (developed by Vicarious Visions). Both games are played in a 2D isometric viewpoint, and feature many elements from the console versions. The action on the Game Boy Color is primarily horizontal on the screen (while the player can also navigate the open-world vertically). The Game Boy Advance version is more faithful to the original game, replicating the levels, graphics, and gameplay.[CR]Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 is the first game in the franchise to feature crossover characters as hidden playable skaters. Spider-Man, a superhero from the Spider-Man franchise) appears as a hidden unlockable skater.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] Enhancements[CR]While THPS2 did not introduce any new gameplay modes, it added a series of new features that turned into meaningful additions to the franchise. These start with the Create-A-Modes.Create-a-SkaterCreate-A-Skater editor menu.[CR]Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 added the ability to create your own skater, allowing you to play through the Career Mode (as well as the game's other various modes) as an avatar of yourself or a custom edited character. The mode allowed a then-large amount of options for your character's appearance and allowed the user to distribute stat points wherever they pleased as opposed to THPS1's forced stat growth.An example of a custom gap[CR]The ability to assign custom tricks was also given, allowing the player to re-write any of the default moves' combinations as well as assigning custom special tricks that could be unlocked and assigned to any specific combination of buttons. Special tricks can either be unlocked throughout the game or by purchasing them with cash acquired in the game's career mode. Flip tricks, grab tricks, grind tricks and a limited amount of manuals (also assigned to the Grind button) compiled the variety of special tricks the player could assign.Park EditorThe Park Editor's toolset[CR]Also a new addition was the Park Editor, which allowed players to edit their own custom skateparks with a variety of tools, objects and obstacles. It is grid based and has four distinct themes (Power Plant, Industrial, School, Outside), each changing the appearance of the level and it's objects. The park's size can also be edited according to width and length. The object categories are as follow:CategoryDescriptionStartsSpawn points for Player 1, 2 and HORSE start points.Gap ToolTool to set gaps.RisersElevated platforms varying in size and height.Quarter PipesDifferent set of sizes and heights for quarter pipes. There are two sets: metal QPs and wooden QPs.RailsGround-based rails for grinding. There are two sets: centered rails and offset rails.WallsLow-height walls that can be used as grind surfaces.SlopesSlanted platforms that act as jumps and/or surfaces to ride up heightened terrain.StairsSelf-explanatory, they vary in size and stair count.PoolsLarge, empty pool surfaces. These vary in shape and size.FunboxesHeightened platforms generally surrounded by slopes. These can be custom built using risers and slopes, though the selection in this category usually includes funboxes from single-player levels and specially-shaped sets.KickersSimilar to slopes, though slightly slanted upwards to act as a boosted jump.BenchesBenches, bleachers and other contraptions of the sort.SignsStreet/Publicity signs that can act as grinding/wallride surfaces.FloorPatters/textures that can be applied to the ground surface, such as the Neversoft logo, grass, dirt and pavement.FoliageA selection of trees, planters and flowerbeds.MiscA large wall structure or a steel pillar.[CR]The Park Editor mode also contained a handful of previously-made parks from the team at Neversoft, giving the user some ideas as to where to start when editing a park.New grind tricks.[CR]Probably the most meaningful change to Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 is the addition of the manual, a move that allows player to link tricks together to build up larger combos. Manuals are performed by pressing up and then down on the directional inputs. Pressing down and up will perform a nose manual. During a manual, the player must balance themselves according to the on-screen balance meter. Pressing up and down on the directional inputs will balance the player in the according direction. The longer the manual goes on, the harder keeping balance will become. Spending stat points into the "Manuals" section of the statistics screen will make manuals easier to keep going across further distances. Manuals can be performed after street tricks, such as ollies, flip tricks, grabs or grinds but never after a vert trick. It is possible to link a street combo into a vert trick, however.[CR]A less impactful, although useful during large combo sequences, addition are the added grind tricks to the game's move list. These can be performed by double-tapping in a direction before hitting the Grind button. Example being the Bluntslide, performed by double-tapping down, then hitting the Grind button before hitting a rail. Other grinds include the Overcrook, Crooked and Nosebluntslide grind.Cash Collectables[CR]Cash is the new method of progressing through the game's career mode. Completing goals on the Goal List during career mode will earn the user Cash, which unlocks new levels. Cash that is earned can be spent to purchase new decks, stat points or special tricks. Additionally, each level contains a set number of Cash icons to collect, allowing for further stat-building and unlocks. Easier icons are worth less and hidden or hard to find icons are worth significantly more. Stats will cost more after each point purchase and better decks and tricks will cost much more, so finding these cash icons in each level is encouraged for building a better character.[CR][B]Levels:[/B][CR]Hangar[CR]Location: Mullet Falls, Montana[CR]Hangar is situated in an enclosed airplane hangar. It features a large roll-in drop, a wooden half-pipe, a secret half-pipe located in a wind-tunnel and an active helicopter that, when the player grinds its chopper blades, takes off, destroys part of the roof and opens a hidden, outdoor area.[CR]This level is featured in Tony Hawk's Pro Skater HD.[CR]ObjectivesObjective NameDescriptionCash RewardHigh ScoreObtain a score of 10,000 points$100Pro ScoreObtain a score of 25,000 points$200Sick ScoreObtain a score of 75,000 points$500Collect S-K-A-T-ECollect the SKATE letters$150Barrel HuntRun into 5 scattered barrel stacks$150Collect 5 Pilot WingsCollect 5 floating pilot emblems$250Nosegrind Over the PipeNosegrind over the arching rails on the wooden half-pipe$150Hit 3 Hangtime GapsOllie over 3 special gaps$150Find the Secret TapeCollect the hidden tape$150100% Goals and CashComplete all prior goals and collect all cash icons$200School II[CR]Location: Southern California, California[CR]School II is set in a college campus.

The player drops from an airborne helicopter onto the half-pipe which features a jump at the end of the platform.Skate Heaven[CR]Location: Space[CR]Skate Heaven is the second secret level. It is set in "heaven" which, of course, is in space. It features an inane amount of skateboarding structures like half-pipes, bowls, stairs, rails, gaps, ledges, rails, benches, snake-runs, tunnels and flatland areas. The level is built around a volcano and if the player hops out of the level, an ominous voice (Most likely to symbolize God) either laughs at the player or proclaims "You suck" . In the Game Boy Color version, the volcano is absent, but there are different colored nebulas in the distance instead.Secret LevelsWarehouse (PC Only)[CR]Location: Woodland Hills[CR]Warehouse is primarily an all-around level. It's situated in a dark warehouse and features a hill drop, walls decked with quarter-pipes, a boxed-up taxi cab and a large half-pipe sitting underneath a glass-walled overhang.[CR]This level was originally in Tony Hawk's Pro Skater.Skate Park (PC Only)[CR]Location: Chicago[CR]Skatepark is an all-around level.

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Now you can skate with your friends![CR]Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 is a skateboarding game developed by Neversoft and published by Activision (under their Activision o2 label) for the PlayStation 2 (on October 28, 2001), GameCube (on November 13, 2001), and Xbox (on March 4, 2002). The third installment of the long-running Tony Hawk franchise and the sequel to Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 adds new skaters and levels while introducing new gameplay elements (such as new hidden variations of normal tricks and the Revert, a ground trick that can be executed as soon as the player hits the ground from a quarter-pipe, allowing them to continue from a Vert combo chain), and online multiplayer for up to four players (PlayStation 2 and GameCube versions only). The Career Mode currency system from the predecessor is removed (unlocking levels now just require objective completion, while stat increase points and new decks are gained by picking up special pickups scattered throughout levels).[CR]The game was ported to the PlayStation In October 29, 2001 (by Shaba Games), PC in March 28, 2002 (by Gearbox), and Nintendo 64 in August 20, 2002 (by Edge of Reality). The PlayStation and Nintendo 64 versions run on a slightly-modified Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 engine (still adding gameplay elements like the Revert), changing the level structure of most levels while replacing the secret Cruise Ship level with a new Downhill level. Some of the levels in the original version are believed to be released as downloadable content in Tony Hawk's Pro Skater HD for the Xbox 360 (via Xbox Live Arcade), PlayStation 3 (via PlayStation Network), and PC (via Steam).[CR]Handheld versions were released on both the Game Boy Color on November 15, 2001 (developed by HotGen) and the Game Boy Advance on March 4, 2002 (developed by Vicarious Visions). Both games are played in a 2D isometric viewpoint, featuring many elements from the console versions.[CR]Like Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2, this game features crossover characters from different franchises as playable skaters. Darth Maul (a Sith apprentice from the Star Wars franchise), Wolverine (a superhero from the X-Men franchise), and Kelly Slater (a surfer from Kelly Slater's Pro Surfer) are included as hidden unlockable skaters. The PC version of the game features Doom from Quake III: Arena (as Doom Guy).[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Revert[CR]The revert is a move that allows players to link vert tricks into a new or in-progress combo. It is a flatland trick that is performed immediately when landing off of a vert surface like a quarter-pipe or pool lip. The more times it is used in a single combo, the slower the player's speed will be when exiting the revert. To link vert tricks into a combo, a manual must be performed immediately after the revert animation.Open Environments[CR]Despite Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 featuring large, open-ended levels, THPS3 used it's current generation of systems' power to its advantage and brought the large-scale environments to life. Areas were now filled with NPCs, moving cars that would stop at obstacles, complex animated objects and real-time level shifting. Every level in THPS3 features a large or minor-scale change that can be triggered through the player's actions and either unlocks a previously hidden area or completely changes a part of the level altogether. These could either be part of a level goal or simply a hidden secret for the player to discover.Trick Modifiers[CR]One other major addition to the game was the Trick Modifier system. This is a system that has been with the franchise since, although being refined in THPS4 and perfected in Tony Hawk's Underground. The trick modifier system are "Hidden moves" that can be performed by actions on the face buttons. For example, hitting the button combination for a kickflip while hitting the flip trick button twice will perform a Double Kickflip. Hitting it three times will perform a Triple Kickflip. Though THPS3 refers to them as Hidden Moves (An on-screen pop-up appears with a bonus score being awarded), they have become the standard in the series for performing modified versions of standard tricks.Network Play[CR]A breakthrough addition to the series is the addition of online multiplayer. This would later be refined in later entries of the franchise but the base concept remains the same. The game allows for up to 4 players in one lobby and drops them in a Free Skate session. The host then decides which game type will be played. The various game types can be found below. Players could either play through a Broadband connection or, on the PlayStation 2 and GameCube, a dial-up connection.[CR][B]Game Modes:[/B][CR]Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 features a wide variety of game modes thanks to the addition of Network Play. Some new, some returning from past entries.Single-player ModesCareer Mode[CR]The same as it's always been in the series. The player is given a list of goals within a level and a two-minute timer to complete them. The level can be retried multiple times to complete the goals. Completing goals unlocks more levels until the last competition level is beaten. A few changes have been made to the Career Mode in THPS3, however. They are:Cash is no longer required to progress within the career mode. The collectible is entirely gone from the game.Stat points are no longer purchased but are, instead, hidden inside levels as collectibles. There are 5 per level. Collecting one lets you assign one stat point wherever the player wishes to.Decks are no longer purchased but are collected. One "Deck" collectible is hidden in each level and collecting it unlocks one deck for the selected pro skater.Collect S-K-A-T-E is now different depending on the selected pro skater. Street skaters will have their letters on lower, more technical areas of the level while vert skaters will have them on more vert/gap oriented areas. All-around skaters will have a mixture of both.Skater-specific goals. Much like the Collect S-K-A-T-E separation, certain level-based objectives will be dependent on the selected skater's specialty.Single Session[CR]Gives the players a two-minute timer without goals to set high scores.Free Skate[CR]Allows the player to freely roam levels, find gaps and search for secrets.Multiplayer ModesGraffiti[CR]Both players compete in the level against the clock to capture as much territory as possible. Performing a trick on an object will paint it the player's color and painting as much of the level as possible is the objective. Players can re-capture an object by scoring higher than the previous player's object score.Trick Attack[CR]Players compete against each other to score the highest. The player with the highest score when the timer runs out wins.HORSE[CR]Pits players against each other to see who can pull off the best trick sequence. Players have 10 second turns and start at key points within each map. When one player pulls of his trick, the next player must score higher. This keeps going until one of the players screws up, getting the first letter of HORSE (Or a custom word chosen at the beginning of the game).Slap![CR]Slap! requires players to skate around and, quite literally, slap each other the most. Simply running into each other causes players to slap each other, though the fastest one will come out the victor. The other will bail and fall to the floor. The player with the highest amount of slaps at the end of the timer wins.King of the Hill[CR]King of the Hill places a floating crown in the level. When a player collects it, it appears over his head and he must hold onto it the longest. If another player rams into him, he gains control of the crown. The objective is to hold the crown the longest, hitting preset timer scores.[CR][B]Levels:[/B][CR]The FoundryLocation: An indoor metal foundry.[CR]The Foundry is a level set in, wait for it, metal foundry. It features multiple stories, catwalks and large jumps and pipes. The level has a large set of metal, ceiling-suspended catwalks, girders, pipes and airborne rails that can be grinded as well as a large cauldron. The cauldron is the level's destructible object. When grinding the top of a nearby control booth, the bucket flips over itself and falls into the cauldron, creating a rail-based jump gap. There are also other heightened ledges and platforms, a large sunken quarter pipe and an electricity turbine that can be entered when complete a Career objective named "Un-jam the 5 Valves".Goal List:NameDescriptionHigh ScoreTrick up to a score of 10,000 points.Pro ScoreTrick up to a score of 30,000 points.Sick ScoreTrick up to a score of 50,000 points.Collect S-K-A-T-ECollect the S K A T E letters scattered throughout the level.Get the Secret TapeCollect the Secret Tape.Cannonball over the Half-Pipe (Vert Skaters)Perform a Cannonball over the large, sunken half-pipe at the beginning of the level.50-50 TC's Rail (Street Skaters)Perform a 50-50 Grind on one of the rails near the raising platform control station.Soak the ForemanPerform a grind on the control panel of the platform-raised pool.Grind the Molten BucketAs the bucket is dumping molten metal, jump up to the rails on the side and grind them.Un-jam 5 ValvesSimply grind 5 wall-mounted valves.100% Goals, Stats and DeckComplete all the goals, find all the hidden stat points and find the hidden deck.CanadaLocation: An outdoor skatepark located in a woody, snow-filled, lakeside park.[CR]Canada is one of the game's larger levels, featuring extremely open areas that form both an outdoor park and skatepark. Part of the level is a parking lot featuring a handful of jumps and rails, a skatepark featuring a set of massive bowls, quarter pipes and half-pipes as well as a amerindian totem pole that totally isn't a stereotype at all. Next to the skatepark is a forested area featuring a wood-build catwalk that circles through trees above a set of quarter pipes and directly next to that area is an above-ground/water platform. The platform is on two levels, the first level being a simple plank board leading up to a quarter pipe. A canadian man peeing in the water stands at the top of the QP. A switch nearby activates access to the upper-level that leads to a wooden tube-like pipe slanted down from a mountain-track mining-cart rail. The rail leads to nowhere. The level's destructive element is quite banal, simply being the ability to knock the head off of the totem pole.Goal List:NameDescriptionHigh ScoreTrick up to a score of 35,000 points.Pro ScoreTrick up to a score of 70,000 points.Sick ScoreTrick up to a score of 120,000 points.Collect S-K-A-T-ECollect the S K A T E letters scattered throughout the level.Get the Secret TapeCollect the Secret Tape.Melon Grab Over the Blade (Vert Skaters)Perform a Melon grab over the roll-in at the start of the level.Nosegrind Around the Horn (Street Skaters)Perform a Nosegrind around the wooden catwalks found in the forested area.Get Chuck UnstuckSimply ram into the poor gentleman who's tongue is stuck onto a pole.Bury That Bully!Jump into the snowy tree behind a bully that is throwing snowballs at kids.Impress The SkatersThere are five skaters located throughout the skatepark. Perform a combo over 2,500 points near them to impress them. Impress all 5 to complete the objective.100% Goals, Stats and DeckComplete all the goals, find all the hidden stat points and find the hidden deck.Rio - Competition LevelLocation: A skatepark located in the high mountains of Rio de Janiero.[CR]Rio is the first of three competition levels. Like previous games, a one-minute timer is given to three rounds. The score from the best two out of three rounds is tallied and the skater with the highest score wins the gold. The level itself is set in a high-mountain area of Rio. The O Cristo Redentor statue is visible from the level. The level itself is generally comprised of bowls, quarter-pipes and half-pipes. A series of ledges, wires and rails circle the level that provide, to skilled players, an opportunity to pull-off a near-infinite combo. There's a hidden backyard pool and ledges that can be grinded on nearby houses. The destructible object in the level is a wooden platform that is supported by a ladder. When the ladder is hit by the player, it collapses and turns into two ledges that add to the infinte combo mentioned above.SuburbiaLocation: A suburban neighborhood.[CR]Suburbia is located in a neighborhood cul-de-sac and is split into 4 distinct areas. The first is the Trailer Park. It features a large, wooden half-pipe and sits next to trailer homes. The trailer homes have wooden planks and ramps next to/on them allowing them to be used as jumps and/or platforms. The trailer park area is also surrounded by a wooden quarter-pipe that sticks to the location's fence. The second area is the family homes. There are two. The first is a two-storey house that has a large, empty underground pool and is surrounded by a grindable fence. The second is a large, upper-class home. It has an accessible driveway, a green Jeep Wrangler parked in the driveway and has a backyard entirely covered in quarter-pipes. The third area is an under-construction home. The house also has a pool in it's backyard and is basically a large, wooden skeleton that can be grinded. Here is where you find an axe, needed to access the fourth area: the Haunted House. The haunted house is boarded-up. There is a Career Mode goal where a man will chop down the boards when given an axe. Doing this unlocks the house's backyard that is filled with quarter-pipes. The area instantly turns dark when you enter it and there are a number of zombie hands that burst out of the ground. The player can then jump into the house to find "spooky" hidden secrets.Goal List:NameDescriptionHigh ScoreTrick up to a score of 55,000 points.Pro ScoreTrick up to a score of 110,000 points.Sick ScoreTrick up to a score of 200,000 points.Collect S-K-A-T-ECollect the S K A T E letters scattered throughout the level.Get the Secret TapeCollect the Secret Tape.Nosegrab Between the Ramps (Vert Skaters)Perform a Nosegrab in the air while transferring between two Trailer Park quarter pipes.Heelflip the Trailer Hop (Street Skaters)Perform a Heelflip over one of the trailer homes.Squash 5 PumpkinSmash 5 pumpkins scattered throughout the level.Help the Thin ManFind the axe at the construction site and give it to the Thin Man waiting by the Haunted House.Restore Power to the DishGrind the electrical wire that's filled with branches leading up to the upper-class home.100% Goals, Stats and DeckComplete all the goals, find all the hidden stat points and find the hidden deck.AirportLocation: An indoor, straight-line airport.[CR]Airport is a level that is akin to the Downhill Jam and Mall levels from Tony Hawk's Pro Skater. Like those levels, Airport is built in a single straight line that leads to a dead end. Unlike those levels, the level doesn't end when reaching the bottom. The level consists of four floors. The first floor is where the baggage room, helipad and main corridor are. The corridor has a automated walkway and access to bathroom facilities. The baggage room is exactly what it sounds like. It can be accessed through the helipad, which can be accessed from the baggage claim counter at the start of the level. The second level consists of another walkway, metal detectors and more bathrooms. The third level drops down from a large escalator and consists of a series of benches, a large half-pipe and a giant, window-walled atrium. The atrium contains a series of rails that support 10 flags. The fourth level is underneath the end of the level.

It was a real-world skatepark located in Rhode Island, USA. In May, 2004, the part closed due to the roof collapsing. It features a large half-pipe, two wooden bowls and a stretch of street funboxes and rails. The level also features two outdoor areas. The first can be accessed through a door at the end of the level that leads to an exterior funbox and a selection of rails. The second area can be accessed by grinding a pirate flag found in the level. A pirate ship outside the level blows cannons into the wall and creates a path to the ship. The ship has a selection of quarter-pipes and ramps. The blown wall is this level's destructible element.Los AngelesLocation: An outdoor, fictional downtown area of Los Angeles.[CR]Los Angeles is one of the biggest level of the entire game. It is split into 6 different areas. The first, the level's start point, is the Complex. It is near a high-raised area that leads directly to the Complex building. The building has a series of planters that can be grinded or aired over as a gap and is directly next to two large staircases. There is a wire that leads up to the top of the building onto it's roof. This area leads directly into the second area, the streets.[CR]The streets circle around the level, near the movie theatre, the inset building, the fire truck and the Car Wash. In the middle of the level is the third area, the Art Park. The park holds weird, stupid post-modern sculptures that act as half-pipes, tunnels and quarter-pipes. Next to this area is the Car Wash, the fourth area. The car wash can be entered (for no reason) and has ramp-like walls. It's rooftop has a half-pipe and the area surrounding the car wash is walled in quarter-pipes. Directly next to this area is the Apartment Buildings, the fifth area. It has a large fountain, a rooftop half-pipe and a raised area featuring a host of ledges. There is a hidden, underground half-pipe here. The sixth and final area can be accessed through the roof in the first area. It's the over-head highway. At the start of the level, the highway is inaccessible since cars pass too fast to allow players to cross it. The level's destructible element is the trigger of a massive earthquake that wrecks most of the level. This causes the highway to break into several sections, allowing the player to access and cross it.Goal List:NameDescriptionHigh ScoreTrick up to a score of 100,000 points.Pro ScoreTrick up to a score of 190,000 points.Sick ScoreTrick up to a score of 400,000 points.Collect S-K-A-T-ECollect the S K A T E letters scattered throughout the level.Get the Secret TapeCollect the Secret Tape.One Foot Japan the Tower Poppin' Transfer (Vert Skaters)Perform a One Foot Japan from the lower quarter-pipe onto the roof half-pipe in the apartments.Varial Kickflip the Tower Rails Gap (Street Skaters)Perform a Varial Kickflip in the air while grind-transfering a set of stair rails.Get Chuck UnstuckSimply ram into the poor gentleman who's tongue is stuck onto a pole.Free Ballin'Jump onto the two balls in the Art Park.Start the EarthquakeGrind the four "____tremor!" rails in the level to trigger the earthquake.Block the Car ChaseThis goal requires the "Start the Earthquake" goal to be complete. Once that is done, go up to the highway and grind on a loosely-hanging billboard so it smashes a runaway car in the streets below.100% Goals, Stats and DeckComplete all the goals, find all the hidden stat points and find the hidden deck.Tokyo - Competition LevelLocation: A Tokyo, high-tech skatepark.[CR]Tokyo is the third and final competition level. It is set at night in a large, enclosed, Shibuya-like area of Japan. It features a lot of vert bowls, half-pipes and quarter pipes. Most of it's edges are lined in neon and there are a few arc-shaped rails and overhead walkways. Tokyo features an incredible amount of hidden areas. Glass windows, electronic billboards and overhead half-pipes all decorate the level as secret areas. There's an airborne blimp that floats in the sky that supports a suspended, holographic-like platform that makes cool computer noises when riding on it. Tokyo is arguably the most visually impressive level of the game.Cruise ShipLocation: A cruise boat.[CR]Cruise Ship is an unlockable, technically secret, level. However, it features actual Career Mode goals. The ship itself features an upper deck with a pool and water-slide. The lower level has a party deck with patio chairs and tables along with a large, oversized wedding cake. The lowest level is the side of the ship which features a vegetation atrium, the front of the ship that has a perfect, Titanic-esque point and is filled with ramps and quarter-pipes as well as a museum dedicated to the ship. The side opposite of the atrium is a hallway with doors to cabins and rescue boats. The player can jump off the ship but will fall into a hazard and respawn on the boat.Goal List:NameDescriptionHigh ScoreTrick up to a score of 150,000 points.Pro ScoreTrick up to a score of 225,000 points.Sick ScoreTrick up to a score of 500,000 points.Collect S-K-A-T-ECollect the S K A T E letters scattered throughout the level.Get the Secret TapeCollect the Secret Tape.Invert the High Wires (Vert Skaters)Perform an Invert liptrick on the high wires above the pool.

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]While traveling down a river in a tube, players attempt to avoid obstacles and score points by passing through gates. Combinations of gates increase a score multiplier. Players rotate their tubes and paddle to increase speed. They gather letters for points (and potentially a free t-shirt), and gather pop cans - which can be thrown at obstacles. Power-ups allow players to carry multiple cans. Gameplay[CR]The game can be played either solo or co-op. Although there is a competitive aspect to the co-op mode in the form of getting more points and pop cans than the opponent. If players dawdle too long, an alligator begins chasing the player, forcing them to either speed up. Lives are represented by patches (as in patches that can be used to repair a tube).The game has three different classes, each with five rivers, for a total of 15. The rivers in each class are as follows:Colorado, Amazon, Okeefenokee, American, and Argentum.Yukon, Styx, Left Bank, Cuprum, and Nile.Jurassic, Black Forest, Rio Grande, Canals Of Mars, and Nightmare.The game's playable characters are Bif and Jet. Whenever there is only one player in the game, there is a computer-controlled opponent called Flotsam.The original arcade version of Toobin' exclusively controlled via buttons; using five of them for each player. Four of the buttons represent hands and direction, such as putting the left hand forward, or the right hand back. This allows for tank-like propulsion and rotation. The fifth button is used for throwing soda cans at obstacles.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>Top Gun: Firestorm takes the player to the skies again in twelve missions where numerous aerial and ground based enemies need to be fought to arhieve victory.[CR]The story is very loosely based on the movie of the same name. The player guides the well known pilot Maverick through a series of realistic training missions to receive graduation from the Top Gun school. The story is advanced in several stills throughout the game.[CR]The player will fly a F-14 Tomcat on an isometric map. He has to complete several objectives in each mission. To achieve those he has four different weapons at his disposal (machine gun, bombs, rockets and missiles). The gameplay is somewhat similar to the Strike series.[CR]https://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy-color/top-gun-firestorm[CR]</plot>

		<plot>On their way to help in the battle against Sargon, a crew of adventurers each skilled in their own way encounter a storm that rips a hole in their ship. Safely reaching Lamini, or Land of Towers, the friendly people of the land help repair the damaged ship. As the crew members are looking for a job, they meet the Mayor of the town who is in need of messengers. He tells the adventurers that Lord Baniff has not been heard from in weeks, and that he needs them to seek him out in his Tower and bring word of his condition. Entering the doorway into the Tower, the entrance collapses behind them and they must find their way out.[CR]The gameplay is similar to other first-person realtime D&amp;D games like the Eye of the Beholder series, though not as complex. There are four characters in the game and you choose one to control. Spell incantations are learned from scrolls and are cast by combining the correct syllables. There are 15 levels to explore and tons of monsters and items to find. You can play the game in cooperative mode with another player using a link cable.</plot>

		<title_clean>Turok - Rage Wars</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B] [CR]     Turok: Rage Wars is a arena-based first-person shooter developed by       Acclaim Austin and published by      Acclaim for the Nintendo 64 on October 31, 1999. A spinoff of the     Turok video game franchise, Turok: Rage Wars focuses on multiplayer arena matches rather than a single-player story campaign. The game is very similar in concept to                                       Unreal Tournament and                                      Quake III: Arena, which were released shortly after Rage Wars. A completely different Turok game with the same name was released for the                                     Game Boy Color in December 26, 1999 (as a 2D platformer). The game supports up to four players at a time with a combination of split-screen multiplayer and  AI bots. The game also contains a single-player campaign mode, dubbed Trials Mode. In that mode, you must complete various deathmatch challenges in various game modes (including boss fights) with each available character to unlock weapons for use in Trials Mode, extra skins for that character, and playable characters in Multiplayer and Trials Mode. A special version of Trials Mode can be played with two players, though early versions have a glitch that makes completing the mode impossible.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] [CR]The game contains four game modes, each can be played up to 4 players (or bots): Bloodlust - Standard                                   deathmatch.Team Bloodlust - Standard                                  team deathmatch.Capture the Flag -                                 Capture the flag focused on a neutral flag.Frag Tag - In this game, a random player changes to a monkey,                                chicken, or a harmless baby                              raptor. Their goal is to find a target area to enter while the other players try to frag it.[CR]Weapons [CR]Each player can have up to six weapons at a time: the Warhammer, a choice of two bullet weapons, a choice of two energy weapons, and a choice of one explosive weapon. The only characters with exceptions are                             Tal'set, who has access to all the weapons at once, the Raptor, who uses claws, and the Mites, who bites or spits acid. Each weapon has both a primary and secondary function, share ammo with other weapon types, and is sometimes limited in use in Trials Mode. Bullet WeaponsMag 60 - Standard                            pistol that either fires a three-round burst or a powerful, laser-assisted, single shot. (At the cost of both ammo and movement)Shotgun - Standard                           shotgun that also has a "Street Sweeper" firing mode (fires four shells at the same time accurately).Assault Rifle - Standard                          assault rifle that has a single shot or rapid fire mode.Minigun - Powerful                         minigun that includes a shield that can absorb damage at the cost of energy ammo while still allowing you to fire.Energy Weapons Tek Bow -                   Bow and arrow. Used for long-range sniping.Plasma Rifle - Standard                  plasma rifle that's similar to the Tek Bow.Boomerang - A                 boomerang. Locks onto enemies while aiming the boomerang. Secondary throw slows down enemies at the cost of more energy ammo.Radioactive Flare Gun -                Flare gun with two flare sizes: small (green) and large (purple).Freeze Gun - Energy weapon that fires beams that either slow down enemies or               freeze them.Emaciator - Fires electric balls that shrinks the enemy.Inflator - Fires beams that inflates the enemy.Chestburster - Unlocked after beating the Warehouse with the Mantid Soldier. Fires a beam that implants the enemies with an alien. If that enemy doesn't kill you, an alien pops out of his chest a la    Alien, killing him instantly.Explosive Weapons Scorpion Launcher -                       Rocket launcher. Secondary function sets a magnetic field that attracts rockets.Napalm Gel -                      Remote mine launcher. Grenade Launcher -                    Grenade launcher with two firing modes: One that explodes after a few bounces and one that explodes after direct contact.Other Weapons  Warhammer - The basic melee weapon for every character (except Raptor and Mites).  Has a normal swing and a charged swing (dealing more damage). Uses no ammo. Cerebral Bore - Classic item from              Turok 2: Seeds of Evil. You must lock on to an enemy to use it (and it takes some time), pierces the skull for heavy damage and paralyzation. Sentry Turret - Deployable sentry gun item. Fires rapid laser beams.PFM Mines -          Proximity mines. Can hurt enemies, teammates, and yourself.Iron Claw - Basic         bear trap item that deals small damage over a short period of time.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Cheat Passwords[CR]Enter one of the following passwords for the desired affect:</plot>

		<title_clean>Vigilante 8</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Vigilante 8, which was released in July of 1998, is a vehicular combat game which and was a spin off of the  PC game  Interstate '76. Vigilante 8 was later re-released on the  Xbox Live Arcade as  Vigilante 8 Arcade on November 5th 2008, it features improved graphics and new arenas. The games story is about an oil crisis in the 1970s which causes several vehicle based skirmishes to break out throughout the country using advanced and top secret weaponry. Vigilante 8 was developed by a team of only 5 people, far less than the usual  PlayStation development teams.[CR]Character Bios[CR]VigilantesConvoyConvoy, Leader of the Vigilantes[CR]Vigilantes' righteous leader. Originally a trucker, he decided to take the law into his own hands after being repeatedly ambushed by Coyotes on his transport routes.Chassey Blue[CR]A beauty queen and secret government agent from D.C., Chassey joined the Vigilantes as part of her undercover assignment to neutralize the Coyotes.Slick Clyde[CR]A showoff playboy from Texas, Clyde was on his way to an auto show in Alburquerque when Convoy confiscated his truck and forced him to help the Vigilantes. (Now Clyde wants to be the leader.)[CR]Ending: In Slick Clydes ending he stops at a rest stop for a break after defeating the Coyotes. Unfortunately, he happens to reach the same rest stop where Houston broke her mind control device. Slick, being the curious man he is, decides to strap on the fancy looking bracelet. The last scene of the ending shows a newspaper headline, claiming that Slick Clyde has become the new leader of the Coyotes. He reappears as the main villain in the sequel, under the monicker of Lord Clyde.Dave[CR]Dave believes aliens are his friends and has been tracking them for years. He joined the Vigilantes in hope of entering Site-4 and seeing some aliens first hand.John Torque[CR]Torque, John Torque. A one-time Vegas hustler, he was recruited by Convoy for the good cause. Now he's Convoy's right-hand man. Vowed never to gamble again.[CR]Ending: John drives off into the sunset claiming never to gamble again, with HIS money. In the back seat of his car he has a suitcase full of cash that he got once he busted Sid. However, the biggest catch is in John's trunk. John caught Sid and is ready to turn him in, swimming in all the cash he needs.Sheila[CR]Convoy's stubborn 16 year-old niece. Sheila loves all the action. Convoy is furious with her, but she won't let him send her back home.Y the Alien[CR](Information Classified)CoyotesSid Burn, Leader of the Coyotes[CR]Sid Burns[CR]A born arsonist, Sid is the Coyotes' ruthless leader. He was promised $100 million by a foreign oil consortium to destabilize the U.S. economy by wreaking havoc in the southwestBeezwax[CR]An enraged Arizona bee keeper. When his bees were mutated by radiation from government nuclear tests, Beezwax joined the Coyotes in revenge.[CR]Ending: After his victory, Beezwax claims ownership of some Site-4 warheads. The deadly explosives are unfortunately colored yellow and black, the same color pattern of his precious bees. One of his bees lands on the tip of the warhead, accidentally blowing Beezwax up in the process. The same bees that helped Beezwax rise to glory, where the same thing that led to his downfall.Boogie[CR]A die hard dance fan, Boogie is the winner of several disco dancing competitions. When not shaking his booty, Boogie runs dirty jobs for Sid.[CR]Ending: While riding off after defeating the last of his Vigilante enemies, Boogie receives the most anticlimactic ending of all of the Coyotes. He is pulled over by the police and convicted of his past crimes.Houston 3[CR]OMAR's scientists turned Houston into a bionic woman against her will. Half human, half machine, she was programmed to aid Sid in his quest for destruction and chaos.Loki[CR]Former military test pilot of secret craft at Site-4, Loki was released from duty after becoming mentally unstable. He is obsessed with flying and will do anything to pilot one of the saucers again![CR]Ending: Loki finally finds one of the saucers he was waiting to pilot. However, after a long period of absence from the controls of a flying saucer Loki accidentally crashes. Due to Loki's alien like appearance, once he is found he is declared as an alien that crash landed his ship on Earth.Molo[CR]An obnoxious kid from New York, Molo was kicked out of school for bad behavior. He stole a school bus and headed west to play bully with the big boys.[CR]Vehicles[CR]Vigilantes' Vehicles'72 Moth Truck[CR]Convoy's truck is definitely one of the heavier duty vehicles - not only is it one of the larger vehicles in the game, but it is also able to take loads of punishment before it bites the dust. As with all heavy vehicles, one of the key tactics is to ram other vehicles - the faster you're going when you hit, the more damage gets done. In addition, when you're lining yourself up to ram another vehicle, fire some weapons at the same time - as long as you don't blast your victim out of the way, chances are they'll take major punishment.'67 Rattler[CR]Chassey's car, although quite lightly armored still holds up as one of the better choices of characters, due in part to the Rattlers high speed and effectiveness of 'Gridlock'. The main advantage of the rattler is its speed and maneuverability, so try and run circles round your opponents and be sure to get out of there if your in trouble. On the downside, it's quite light and any kind of serious blast can knock the Rattler for six.'70 Van[CR]Overall, Daves vehicle is one of the poorer choices in the game - it's not heavily enough armored to make up for it's lack of speed and is too large to provide much avoidance. Its one saving grace, however, is that it has a reasonable ramming ability for such a small vehicle, so it's wise to use this as much as possible.'69 Jefferson[CR]Torque is a very well-balanced character, even better than other all-rounders. Not too slow , not too poorly armored and with reasonable avoidance, Torque is good for beginners and experts. Because he's pretty good all-round, a variety of tactics are available.'74 Strider[CR]Sheila has probably the smallest vehicle in the game, so you really need to exploit this to make the most of the strider. As far as long range attacks go, the best tactic is to drive in amongst scenery, zipping in different directions to through of weapons. Up close, run circles round your opponents to confuse opponents, all the time using weapons like the Bruiser cannon. This stays focused on the enemy without the need to aim.'70 Clydesdale[CR]Slicks vehicle is a pretty good all-rounder, with both reasonable armor and speed . However, it is also chunkier than other all-rounders and this makes it an easier target for weapons '. The flipside of this is that it has ramming potential, especially when up against weaker all rounders. Overall, the Clydesdale is pretty good, but many players prefer the faster and lighter all-rounders. However, Clydes weapon means that you don't need to be near opponents to nail them...Coyotes' VehiclesManta[CR]Sid is a contender for best character in the game, The Manta compares well with Houstons' Palomino, but seems lighter, allowing it to get some serious air and pull off tighter turns. Driving circles round opponents is no problem, as is getting out of sticky situations. The high speed means that you can often just outrun any incoming missiles, or at least hide in amongst scenery. For a great 'run 'n gun' match, put Sid up against Chassey Blue in Canyonlands and watch them tear up the roadside!'70 Stag Pickup[CR]Beezwax is comparable to Dave, both are reasonably strong, but suffer from being to bulky. This makes them easier targets, although Beezwax can sometimes avoid incoming fire. However, the low speed rating and the fact that he can't really go up against characters like Convoy mean that he'll probably one of you least popular choices.'76 Leprechaun[CR]As with Loki, there's not too much to recommend Boogie, as the low speed and armor make him a sitting duck in the arena. His only saving grace is that because he's small, he can avoid incoming fire or long range attacks.'75 Palamino[CR]Houston has the ability to tear around the arenas with ease, as well as powering up inclines to get those vital wrenches. Compared to Sids and Chasseys vehicles, the Palamino is slightly more sluggish and heavier, but this allows you to use it to ram weaker vehicles, so it's a good trade off.'73 Glenn 4x4[CR]Overall, Loki, isn't the greatest of characters, and if you want a small fast vehicle it's probably best to opt for Sheila instead. However, a good fair-fight deathmatch is if you put Loki up against Sheila. On the plus side, Loki does have a very small vehicle, so, the same tactics apply with Sheila - try not to get into any serious close-combat activity or you'll be totalled.'66 School Bus[CR]Molo is a killer when it comes to ramming - hell, he can even go up against Convoy with pretty good odds! Obviously, the faster you're going, the more damage will be inflicted, so use the 'down-the-hill' method or the afterburner combo to push that speedometer into the red. In addition, let off a few rockets to do extra damage, just make sure you don't knock your target out the way, or you'll go hurtling past barely scraping them.[CR][B]Levels:[/B][CR]Aircraft GraveyardCanyonlandsCasino CityGhost TownHoover DamOil FieldsSand FactorySecret BaseSki ResortValley Farms[CR]Special Weapons[CR]Gridlock[CR]Developed for Chassey by government labs, the Gridlock launches an expanding grid of flares. The flares combust on impact in a gaseous discharge, capable of stalling and damaging almost any engine within the grid area.Steel Belter[CR]Advanced weaponry is all well and good, but for Convoy there's nothing like an old truck tire stuffed full of dynamite. Just let it roll and (as luck would have it), it will bounce after the bad guys.Invasion[CR]A small radar dish found at Site-4 finally allowed Dave to establish a channel of communication with the aliens. Now, he doesn't hesitate to call for help when the going gets tough. A swarm of these little saucers spells certain death to anyone who isn't fast enough to outrun them.Bass Quake[CR]Torque bought the best car stereo money could buy and he needed the right speaker box to go with it. This custom-made bad boy has enough bass to ripple the earth!Tantrum Gun[CR]Sheila loves big guns and this 24mm Gatling is as large as her dune buggy can carry. Features an auto-tracking turret. It can knock weapons off enemies' cars!White Lightning[CR]When Slick originally found this large 'rod' at Site-4, he had no idea it was a lightning inducing apparatus. He just thought it was a cool looking antenna! Its charge can fry an electrical system!Gamma Swarm[CR]Don't let Beezwax unleash his mutant killer bees. They will 'sting ya real good!' Can you outrun the swarm?!Disco Inferno[CR]Boogies own invention. An inflatable disco-ball firing explosive flares! Spin, baby, spin!Super Fantastic Death Ray 3-Ax[CR]OMAR's scientists spared no expense when creating weaponry for the ultimate assassin. This blue laser will cut through anything and keep on going. It can knock power-ups off enemies' cars!Scatter Missiles[CR]A rack of three cruise missiles retrofitted by Loki with cluster-bomb warheads.Bad Day In L.A.[CR]Molo won't say what he put into this old junkyard muffler, but he believes it's his best prank yet. It produces fumes so dense, they plug up most engines for good.Breath of Fire[CR]When Sid wanted a rapid-fire molotov launcher for his Manta, he had one made to order by the OMAR boys. A direct hit will set enemy cars ablaze![CR]Banned Vigilante 8 N64 Commercial[CR]Upon release in North America a commercial was released for the game which showed a school bus dropping kids off at school and driving away, after cutting into gameplay the bus would later return to pick the kids up after school but was destroyed. The reason behind it being banned was due to its violent content and was pulled after the Columbine High School Massacre.[CR]</plot>

		<title_clean>Wacky Races</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Wacky Races follows the concept of the TV show of the same name in a Mario Kart style racing game (closed tracks and power ups available) with the entire cast of the TV series. Wacky races allow players to play in both single player and cooperative mode through all the races and challenges as well as support for 3-4 players.[CR]When starting a new story, players pick one of the following vehicles and use that for the duration of the game, i.e. switching vehicles is not allowed throughout the story. Dick Dastardly and  Muttley in the Mean Machine (Race Car # 00)Lazy Luke and Blubber Bear in the Arkansas Chuggabug (Race Car # 8)  The Gruesome Twosome with Rufus Ruffcut vying for 2nd place Penelope Pitstop in the Compact Pussycat (Race Car # 5)Peter Perfect in the Turbo Terrific (Race Car # 9)Professor Pat Pending in the Convert a Car (Race Car # 3)Red Max in the Crimson Haybailer (Race Car # 4)Rufus Ruffcut and Sawtooth in the Buzzwagon (Race Car # 10)Sergeant Blast and Private Meekly in the Army Surplus Special (Race Car # 6)The Ant Hill Mob in the Bulletproof Bomb (Race Car # 7)The Gruesome Twosome in the Creepy Coupe (Race Car #2)The Slag Brothers in the Bouldermobile (Race Car # 1)[CR] Wacky races takes place in a hub world where all races can be entered by driving to a small, themed section within the hub world similar to Diddy Kong Racing. Players must complete challenges and races in order to unlock stars which lead to races against the &#8220;boss&#8217;s&#8221; within the game Namely Pat Pending, Red Max and Dick Dastardly.[CR]Successfully winning against a boss character unlocks that vehicle for use in the single player or cooperative story but cannot be switched to when through a portion of the game as with the rest of the cars.[CR]Race Locations[CR]All race tracks within Wacky Races take place in the 4 following locations within the hub world, each a parody of a real life location.Wild Frontier[CR]Wild Frontier is a desert packed with stereotypical locations for driving around in such as an oil mine and the Wild West towns that surround it.Oil be BackTombstone Pass Los Angle Tease SquareRailway CanyonManic MinesSnowfall Peaks[CR]In contrast to Wild Frontier, Snowfall Peaks is the wintry location within Wacky Races with races usually taking place in and around snowy mountains and caverns.Snow La CostaSnow Hope VillageGruesome TowersGlacier LakeIce CavernsRedwood Valley[CR]Redwood Valley is the balance between the two locations above taking place in a lush forest as with races taking place around a lumberjack mill and sprawling fields for example.Lumberjack LakeScarecrow CreekWood StockadeRedwood SpringsRush More RapidsThe Big Apricot[CR]A deliberate pun on New York City, The Big Apricot is another contrast to the nature of Redwood Valley, taking place in key locations within a bustling modern day city such as a shipyard, an airport terminal and on rooftops of tall skyscrapers.Fish 'n' ShipsSubway ShenanigansAlone in the ParkTerminal TurmoilRooftop Runaround[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Throughout the game the player will participate in a variety of race types including:Track Challenges[CR]Standard time based races where players must compete against other drivers and achieve first place within the time limit for that track.Wacky Cup Challenges[CR]Tournament style challenges in which points are awarded based on the place the player finishes in e.g. 10 points for 1 place, 6 points for 2 place etc.Golden Mutley Challenges[CR]These challenges operate in a similar manner to normal time based races with the one exception that the player must also collect 10 golden Mutley statuettes scattered around the race track in addition to finishing in first place.Battle Challenges[CR]Battle royal style challenges in which each driver is given 3 &#8220;lives&#8221; and must drive around in a closed area, attacking other players to reduce the number of lives they have whilst trying to retain their own.Team 00 Tag Challenges[CR]Elimination style challenges that operate like normal races except the driver in last place on each lap is eliminated until only one driver is left.[CR]Throughout the game each wacky racer also has access to their own uniquely styled gadgets which operate around the following themes. [CR]Boost &#8211; Gives the driver a temporary acceleration boost[CR]Flying &#8211; Allows the driver to float above the ground for a short period of time.[CR]Missiles &#8211; When fired, lock on to the nearest driver in front and cause them to spin 360 degrees.[CR]Mine &#8211; Deploys a mine that detonates if a competing player drives over it[CR]Shields &#8211; Prevents any damage from being taken when used.[CR]Sticky Traps &#8211; Causes any driver that runs over the trap to be temporarily immobilised.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Codes[CR]Enter a race in Trial Mode, then enter the following:[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] All Racers and Tracks[CR]Enter ''MUTTLEY'' as a password.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] All Racers and Tracks[CR]From the Main Menu, choose Options and then Password to enter one of the following:[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Championship Mode: Level Skip[CR]In championship mode, if you press start and then select (separately), the level you are on will end and you will get the amount of points of the place you were in when you quit the level. So once you get into first place you can press start and select and you can do championship mode in five minutes!</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]Title screen for Wario Land II on the GBC.[CR]One morning while Wario is sleeping in his castle, Captain Syrup and her Black Sugar Gang sneak into his home. The invaders manage to steal all of Wario's treasure he had collected in the first Wario Land game and flood his home by leaving a large water faucet in his basement running. During the raid, the Pirate Gooms accidentally set off Wario's giant alarm clock, but make their escape before he begins stirring. Eventually Wario wakes up and figures out what Syrup and her Gooms have done, setting out to find them. He pursues the Brown Sugar Gang across the varied areas outside of his castle in the hopes of having his treasure returned and gaining his revenge against the intruders.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Dungeons! Giant snakes! Giant snakes in dungeons![CR]Wario Land 2 is noticeably different from the first Wario Land game. The most notable difference is that Wario is now invulnerable, and is instead susceptible to different effects from enemy effects. For instance if an enemy stomps on Wario's head, he might be flattened, enabling him to cross gaps he might otherwise have fallen through. Of course some enemies are just nuisances and won't help Wario in any way, but regardless an enemy will never cause Wario to die. This change emphasizes puzzle solving and platforming rather than traditional survival.[CR]The game has several branching level paths that change how the game's storyline plays out, many of which have their own variation of the game's ending. Once the player has completed one of the endings, they can select any stage they have completed and see which treasures they have and have not collected. In order to see the game's "true" ending, the player has to collect every treasure available in the game and complete the entire picture panel that appears after a level is completed.[CR][B]Stages:[/B][CR]Each world, or chapter, consists of five stages and one boss (usually). With only 25 of 50 stages being available with the standard playthrough, searching for hidden level exits adds to the replayability of the game.Chapter 1: One Noisy Morning[CR]The first chapter takes place in Wario's castle and dungeon, kicking out his invaders and doing some damage control. Basic gameplay mechanics are introduced. The very first level also features the most fiendishly hidden secret level exit in the game.Chapter 2: SS Tea Cup[CR]Chapter 2 features the outskirts of Wario's Castle and a return to Captain Syrup's flagship, the SS Tea Cup. This chapter includes an escort mission, of sorts, involving Wario's prize hen, and water/nautical themed levels. The boss of the chapter is Bobo, also familiar from Wario Land 1.Chapter 3: Maze Woods[CR]A heavily forested area, several of the Maze Woods levels are arguably the most punitive, requiring above average reaction skills from the player. The Puffy Wario form is introduced, as is flying by owl.Chapter 4: In Town[CR]An urban themed environment, complete with breaking-and-entering shenanigans! Culminates in a basketball showdown with a giant rabbit, of all things.Chapter 5: Syrup Castle[CR]As the (ordinarily) final chapter, the completely rebuilt Syrup Castle is another castle environment filled with traps and hidden areas. Tricky platforming a puzzles abound, but you can finally confront Captain Syrup and her floating bomb deployment platform in an elaborate multi-stage fight! Well, okay, two stages. Requiring 2 hits each. Still, with her defeat Wario can demolish Syrup's tower a second time, and reclaim his stolen loot.Secret Chapter 1: Invade Wario CastleWario sleeps like a log.[CR]As mentioned, the entrance to the very first secret chapter is fiendishly hidden, and nearly impossible to intentionally reach. Hidden in the first level of the game, you must simply... do nothing. As Wario starts off asleep, simply refraining from touching any buttons will leave him in his slumber, ending the level soon after. In this alternate route, Wario was never awakened by his alarm clock, and Syrup's gang simply toss Wario out and move in! This exit is not reachable the first time you play the game, and can only be accessed after you beat it once, possibly adding to the confusion. The chapter is heavy on the castle theme, as ends with a showdown with Syrup and an armor-plated, radio controlled, robotic giant spear man.Secret Chapter 2: Go To The Cellar[CR]In this alternate route, following the first chapter, Wario takes a short-cut to Maze Woods through the dungeons and caves beneath his castle, meaning the levels are subterranean in theme. Most of these levels are filled with underground monsters and ghosts, although one does take place on a train very similar to the one Wario travels on during the "In Town" chapter. The area's final boss is a repeat of a fight which took place in the original Wario Land, which pits Wario against a giant bull who wants to knock him off of a platform.Secret Chapter 3: Ruins At the Bottom of the Sea[CR]If Wario stumbles upon the giant cork blocking a leak in the SS Tea Cup, he may destroy it, sinking the ship with all hands. Luckily, they are able to emerge in a series of ancient underwater ruins filled with ancient traps and ancient treasure, and so on. The chapter diverges at the fourth level, allowing Wario to continue down the standard path again or go on to the fifth level, containing a game-end boss. This time, Syrup has been captured by a nefarious self-inflatable newt, whose behind Wario kicks, along with Syrup, for good measure.Secret Chapter 4: Mysterious FactoryThis factory does not observe any occupational safety regulations.[CR]Accessible from the factory level in Town, Wario follows Syrup into her hideout in a seemingly purposeless and highly dangerous industrial complex. Get ready for some intense conveyor belt action!Secret Chapter 5: Uncanny Mansion[CR]Also an alternate route from Town, Wario tracks Syrup down in a spooky haunted mansion, filled with a number of devilish puzzles and challenges. The end boss is a slimy ghost with Syrup in his clutches. After defeating him, Wario spots his stolen treasure, but falls down a hidden trap door! Seemingly endless, Wario keeps falling until, (phew!) he wakes up in his bed. It was all a dream! And in a twist on the usual credits sequence, which shows Wario running home with his treasure, we are shown a hot air balloon with Syrup's insignia flying to Wario's castle. Looks like the dream came true.The Really Final Chapter: Steal the Syrup Treasure![CR]Collecting every single treasure and map piece unlocks the true final level: Syrup's treasure vault! A bizarre and surreal environment, this time challenge level tests every skill you've learned and introduces a couple new ones in this challenging and worthy final stage. As it turns out, the final boss is... the giant spear man. Last line of defense or the puppet master? We may never know.[CR][B]Power-ups:[/B][CR]All wound up.[CR]While Wario may be invincible this time around, Wario Land 2 introduces many transformations that change Wario's abilities. Often the player must use these temporary forms to solve platforming challenges, or avoid gaining them to pass a room.Fat Wario[CR]After being force-fed cake by rogue chefs, Wario swells to an impressive size. His speed and jumping is severely restricted, but he now breaks blocks by simply jumping onto them, and crushes enemies underfoot.Flat Wario[CR]Being flattened by a stone idol turns Wario comically flat. He becomes defenseless but can lazily drift through the air like a sheet of paper, allowing him to cross chasms and fit into small gaps, as well as crossing holes in the floor he would otherwise fall through.Puffy Wario[CR]Wario is highly allergic to bee stings! Being stung makes Wario's face puff up and apparently fill with helium, causing him to float to the ceiling.Spring Wario[CR]Being hit by a hammer turns Wario into a human spring, turning him defenseless but allowing him to jump much higher.Zombie Wario[CR]Touching a ghost or being infected by a fellow zombie turns Wario undead. He loses the ability to jump, but can now fall through thin floors.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Reverse Hill Slide[CR]This glitch allows you to slide the wrong way up a hill. Position yourself about 3 or 4 steps from the top of the hill. Body Slam (B Button) up the hill. At the top, press Down. If done correctly, Wario will roll away from the top of the hill, going up the hill.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Flagman D.D. Mini-Game[CR]Beat the game with 100% treasures and map pieces. Along with an extra level, you will also get a mini game: Flagman D.D.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Flagman D.D. Mini-Game[CR]To access a secret level and new ending, instead of waking up Wario to begin the game, let him continue to sleep.  Level 1 will come to an end, pirates will carry Wario out to the nearby woods where the level begins.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Flagman D.D. Mini-Game[CR]When you get to the door that enters in to the bunny boss, simply pick up the little swordsman that is on the other side of the room and throw him(full strength) against the wall above the door, go through the hole in the wall you just made, pick up the swordsman again and throw him into the next wall, go through that hole and there is the secret exit.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Flagman D.D. Mini-Game[CR]Anytime during the game, you can hold down Start and Select then press A and B simultaneously. This will reset the game back to the title screen.</plot>

		<title_clean>Wario Land 3</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Megaspoiler: Wario looks for treasure in this game.Wario Land 3 is a unique take on the platforming genre. While featuring basic coin collection and platforming elements, the Wario land series puts a twist on the genre by making Wario an indestructible character. While Wario may be invulnerable, he suffers different effects when he is attacked by his enemies. While this may seem to be a disadvantage, the conditions his enemies inflict upon him actually give him new abilities that allow him to overcome the obstacles in his path. Wario must use this asset and his wits to find and collect different colored keys to open color-coded treasure chests. The contents of these chests allow access to new areas, new powerups, or change in previous levels. The difficulty of accessing the various chests combined with Wario's invincibility make the game a very puzzle focused affair.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]Always trust shadowy figures that offer treasure.Wario is cruising along in his plane one day when the engine sputters out and he crashes down to the woods below. He quickly discovers a cave, and heading inside finds a music box on a stand. To Wario's surprise, there appears to be a tiny little world inside the box! As he inspects it closer, the box begins to glow, and Wario is drawn into the world! He finds himself inside a temple, where he is addressed by a large, shadowy figure. The figure tells Wario that it was imprisoned by an evil being, which took it's power away and sealed it inside the temple. Only by finding five magical music boxes and restoring the being to it's former status as ruler of the music box can Wario leave. Of course, he is more motivated by the being's promise of allowing him to keep all the treasure he finds on his way.As it would turn out, the figure was actually the evil Rudy the Clown. After a somewhat short final battle, all the enemys in the game revert to their original form as innocent citizens of Music Box Land. Wario is hailed as a hero as the village elder tells him that Rudy the Clown put the curse on all of the people before he was sealed away, they tryed to stop Wario but they never guessed that he could actually beat Rudy. He is sent back to his world with a massive bag of treasure. He winks at the screen and runs off.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Wario's let himself go recently.Wario Land 3 plays like a typical two-dimensional platformer, with a few twists. Just like he was in the previous game, Wario is completely invincible and cannot die. Often the stages require Wario to alter himself in comical and unique ways to get through a level. Such conditions include lighting Wario on fire, eating an item to make Wario even fatter (it's apparently possible), or inflating him to float through a level. Time of day also factored into the stages, with nighttime bringing zombies or other creatures that could either help or hinder Wario depending on the situation. The various ways in which the levels and Wario himself can be altered mean plenty of backtracking and non-linear gameplay, along with many multi-part puzzles. Wario Land 3's unique presentation was enhanced by colorful character and level design and a catchy soundtrack.[CR]Conditions[CR]Since Wario Land 2 had diverted the series from a Mario spinoff into its own unique platforming series involving invulnerability, this game (And WL2) has instead focused hugely on Wario being afflicted by various coniditons which some enemies or objects can place him under. A detailed explanation of each coniditon is included below:Fat WarioFat Wario is able to bounce off enemy attacks and break blocks underneath him that regular Wario cannot break. This is done by eating a donut thrown at Wario from one of the enemies.Spring WarioSpring Wario can jump far higher than regular Wario, but he also uncontrollably bounces around. This powerup is given to you when you are hit by an enemy that has a hammer with the ability to crush you into a spring.Zombie WarioWario becomes a green, slimy zombie when hit by certain enemies. In this form, Wario walks slowly and falls through thin floors when he jumps on them which he wouldn't fall through otherwise. Touching water or a source of light will immediately dezombify him.Snowball WarioWhen covered by snow, Wario turns into a giant snowball (with eyes and a moustache.) and can move onto a slope to roll down it. Like a real snowball, as he rolls he will grow bigger, giving him the ability to break certain blocks. However, the snowball has to travel directly once it starts rolling and cannot stop.Vampire WarioWhen bitten by a flock of bats or hit by certain enemies, Wario will turn into a Vampire. He has two forms. In regular form, Wario floats around with a ghostlike lower body. In bat form, he turns into, you guessed it, a bat. If Wario touches any light or water, he will return to his regular form.Balloon WarioWhen stung by bees, Wario ends up getting an allergic reaction, causing his face to swell up to gigantic proportions and him to float like a balloon. As Balloon Wario, Wario can float upwards until he hits a ceiling or an obstacle, in which case, he will deflate and begin to fall.Fire WarioWhen Wario is set on fire, he runs back and forth with his arms up, panicking. When in this form, he destroys all in his path and eventually burns out and returns to normal.Flat WarioWhen Wario has been squished into a pancake, he can jump short distances in the air and gently float downwards like a piece of paper would. This also allows him to enter small crevices and walk across small pits which he'd fall through otherwise.Invisible WarioWhen a crazy scientist throws one of his potions at Wario, it can turn him invisible. This can be useful in some situations. Of course there are ways to remove this invisibility.Frozen WarioMore of a hinderence than anything. Some enemies can freeze Wario, causing him to slide backwards until he collides with a wall, at which point his frozen body breaks and he is back to normal.Blinded WarioSome enemies (such as ghosts) can land on Wario, temporarily blinding him until he collides with another object.[CR]Golf[CR]Wario has an opportunity to make a birdie.The game also features a golfing minigame where Wario attempts to knock an enemy into a golf tee within a certian number of attempts. The game only takes place in two dimensions, so all Wario really needs to do is alter the power of his shots. If he times his shot incorrectly while setting it's power, he will trip and lose a stroke. Also, there are several obstacles located on every hole, like bodies of water or lava pits. Hitting the enemy into one of these will also cost Wario a stroke. Playing this game is actually necessary to open up certian paths through stages, so practicing it is a good idea. Also, each stage contains eight giant coins with a musical note on them. By collecting every musical coin the game has to offer, Wario will unlock an extended version of the Golf game where he will play through an entire course and get a total score at the end.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] 4th Golf Mini-Game course[CR]Get all 8 musical coins in every level in the game before you open time atack to get a 4th golf minigame course, which can be played between N world and W world once all 7 crayons are aquired.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] 4th Golf Mini-Game course[CR]You will find a crayon in the gray chest of Above the Clouds, the green chest of The Desert Ruins, the red chests of the Warped Void, Beneath the Waves, the Big Bridge, and the Vast Plain, and finally, the blue chest of the Pool of Rain.  You'll unlock the building between the north and west after getting the crayons.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] 4th Golf Mini-Game course[CR]Get all the treasure in each level to play the Time Attack Mode</plot>

And in a twist on the usual credits sequence, which shows Wario running home with his treasure, we are shown a hot air balloon with Syrup's insignia flying to Wario's castle. Looks like the dream came true.The Really Final Chapter: Steal the Syrup Treasure![CR]Collecting every single treasure and map piece unlocks the true final level: Syrup's treasure vault! A bizarre and surreal environment, this time challenge level tests every skill you've learned and introduces a couple new ones in this challenging and worthy final stage. As it turns out, the final boss is... the giant spear man. Last line of defense or the puppet master? We may never know.[CR][B]Power-ups:[/B][CR]All wound up.[CR]While Wario may be invincible this time around, Wario Land 2 introduces many transformations that change Wario's abilities. Often the player must use these temporary forms to solve platforming challenges, or avoid gaining them to pass a room.Fat Wario[CR]After being force-fed cake by rogue chefs, Wario swells to an impressive size. His speed and jumping is severely restricted, but he now breaks blocks by simply jumping onto them, and crushes enemies underfoot.Flat Wario[CR]Being flattened by a stone idol turns Wario comically flat. He becomes defenseless but can lazily drift through the air like a sheet of paper, allowing him to cross chasms and fit into small gaps, as well as crossing holes in the floor he would otherwise fall through.Puffy Wario[CR]Wario is highly allergic to bee stings! Being stung makes Wario's face puff up and apparently fill with helium, causing him to float to the ceiling.Spring Wario[CR]Being hit by a hammer turns Wario into a human spring, turning him defenseless but allowing him to jump much higher.Zombie Wario[CR]Touching a ghost or being infected by a fellow zombie turns Wario undead. He loses the ability to jump, but can now fall through thin floors.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Reverse Hill Slide[CR]This glitch allows you to slide the wrong way up a hill. Position yourself about 3 or 4 steps from the top of the hill. Body Slam (B Button) up the hill. At the top, press Down. If done correctly, Wario will roll away from the top of the hill, going up the hill.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Flagman D.D. Mini-Game[CR]Beat the game with 100% treasures and map pieces. Along with an extra level, you will also get a mini game: Flagman D.D.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Flagman D.D. Mini-Game[CR]To access a secret level and new ending, instead of waking up Wario to begin the game, let him continue to sleep.  Level 1 will come to an end, pirates will carry Wario out to the nearby woods where the level begins.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Flagman D.D. Mini-Game[CR]When you get to the door that enters in to the bunny boss, simply pick up the little swordsman that is on the other side of the room and throw him(full strength) against the wall above the door, go through the hole in the wall you just made, pick up the swordsman again and throw him into the next wall, go through that hole and there is the secret exit.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Flagman D.D. Mini-Game[CR]Anytime during the game, you can hold down Start and Select then press A and B simultaneously. This will reset the game back to the title screen.</plot>

In desperation, Queen Azarel summons the realm's wizards for help.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Resource-management and base/unit building is a major part of gameplay, but the real depth lies in mastering the power of the collectible Wizard units. Serving as the game's version of the typical RTS hero unit, each Wizard has their own unique power, ranging from building reinforcement to the ability to turn other units into chickens. Taking a cue from Pokemon, Wizards can be traded from game to game, but instead of using a Game Link cable Warlocked uses the Game Boy Color's infrared sensor.[CR]In the game's main story mode, players can play as either the Humans or the Beasts, each with their own set of missions. Using a Game Link cable two players can engage in a skirmish mode.[CR]The game also features two minigames - a version of Poker and a sliding puzzle.[CR]Sequel Cancellation[CR]A sequel, Wizards, was in development for the Game Boy Advance at Bits Studios, but was canceled for unknown reasons before development could be finished.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Special Codes[CR]Enter the codes on the "Check Code'' screen to get the following options in the Cheat Menu:</plot>

		<title_clean>Warriors of Might and Magic</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Published and developed by The 3DO Company, Warriors of Might and Magic was released for the Playstation, Playstation 2, and the Game Boy Color. Each version was essentially a different game, though they all follow a similar storyline. All three versions star Alleron, a guard captain accused of necromancy.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Warriors of Might and Magic follows a traditional route of Action RPG gaming. Players start in a hostile environment from the start, and are given their first equipment and spell at the start. The game requires caution, and wise use of health potions, as they are the only means of recovering hitpoints.[CR]There are of variety of weapons, shields, armor and items, all with different elemental bases and effects.[CR]Combat itself takes place in a real time, hack-and-slash fashion, allowing players to dodge, guard and counter-attack as they see fit.  With 27 available spells total, Magic also plays a key role in battle, and it may be used for anything from slowing an opponent, to buffering your own strength and defense, to causing a foe to fight for you. From summoning and army of phantoms, to burning your enemy to a crisp, to increasing your speed for a short time. There are many different spells to chose from, and they all have their uses. Like in most RPGs, players gain experience by defeating enemies. Upon leveling up, players may distribute points to their attributes as they see fit. Alleron's stat categories are as follows: Might, Speed, Intelligence, and Endurance.   The Status Screen at level-up.      Might - helps to determine Alleron's total attack rating. Speed - determines Alleron's movement speed, and attack speed. Intelligence - determines the effectiveness of spells, as well as Alleron's total mana points. Endurance - determines Alleron's total hitpoints.[CR]Story (Spoilers)[CR]The game opens with Alleron on trial for necromancy. This seems to be a formality, rather than a real trial, as sentence is passed right away. The Inquisitor places a cursed mask called "The Mask of the Accused" upon Alleron's face to mark him as a necromancer. The mask seems to take a life of it's own, driving claws into his neck so that it cannot be removed. Alleron is then cast into the Pit of the Accused, and the game starts immediately.[CR]Alleron must escape the arena area they have been thrown into, and through a series of prison cells and sewers that are crawling with monsters and undead creatures. From here, it is up to the player to escape the Pit, and reach the outside world. Apok [CR] Along the way he meets and rescues an orc named Apok from the undead, and Apok in return helps Alleron by giving him a magic ring, and later aiding him in escaping the Orc Mines.  [CR]This leads him into a ravine, where he meets a talking raven named Carlon that has somehow had his feet magically trapped in a rock. The raven agrees to help Alleron remove his mask, if he will find a potion to dissolve the stone. Alleron meets Carlon the raven.  [CR]Following the ravine floor, Alleron finds himself in the orc-populated Village of Draklor, which holds even greater dangers. Draklor, the new orc chief, is preparing to have the old chief killed as per some kind of tradition. The old chief's wife is distraught, and asks Alleron to save her husband, which he does. Though grateful, the reunited couple then asks that you recover their food. Draklor has taken all they had to eat in order to celebrate. Alleron once again rises to the occasion and confronts the cruel orc chieftain, managing to slay him. Alleron uses the potion to free Carlon. [CR] The old chief and his wife are extremely grateful and tell him about a way out of the ravine. In a small cave near the top of the cliffs, Alleron finds a potion that can free the raven, and in return, the bird directs him to the Monastery of Enroth. [CR]At the monastery Alleron meets a monk named Saelo, who introduces him to his apprentice, Daria. Though he mentions the quests of  Enroth, but insists that he cannot help a known necromancer. As Daria leaves the room, he slyly directs Alleron's attention to a tapestry saying "For example, I could not direct ones attention to this map, detailing the first Quest of Enroth." Alleron then makes for the site detailed on the map.  [CR] After battling countless gargoyles and golems,  Alleron has both the Red and Green Gems of Enroth in his possession. We then see Daria speaking with The Inquisitor, and complaining that Alleron is still alive. The Inquisitor mentions a prophecy, and says it forbids her to kill Alleron. Daria retorts that she would never bloody herself, and The Inqusitor assures her that so long as Alleron wears the Mask of the Accused, his mercenaries can kill him, but Daria does not seem convinced.  [CR]Passing through a magic gate requiring both gems to pass, Alleron finds an ancient tome revealing a startling secret: It has been foretold that only a child of Einar, one of the immortal ancients, could complete the Quests of Enroth. It begins to foreshadow Alleron as the world's guardian, and a son of Einar. The book also states that the children of Einar cannot kill each other. Upon his return to the surface-level of the Monastery, Alleron finds Saelo preparing to leave. He questions the monk, and Saelo replies that he is planning to go to the City of Magic, a dangerous trip to be sure, and that it is there that the magic vial exists that can be used to remove the Mask of the Accused. Alleron offers to go in his stead, leaving Saelo to marvel at his bravery, and to question if he might truly be the "one".  After battling his way into the City of Magic, Alleron meets a wizard who aids him in passing through a magical doorway in exchange for finding his rune and scroll. In the next chamber, he finds the potion he was sent for, the one that can finally remove the Mask of the Accused. However, to his surprise he also finds Daria. She blasts the entrance to the chamber, making it impossible for Alleron to return the way he came. She chuckles, telling him he must now travel through the Maze, and the lair of the dreaded Talinthraxus, a dragon who is under her control.  The helpful coyote.  Arriving at the maze, Alleron finds his way through with the help of a mysterious coyote. The coyote also leads him to people who have been imprisoned in the walls by dark magics. After fighting through and navigating the maze, Alleron comes face-to-face with the "Minotaur Twins" who are to blame for the trapped people (they also guard the exit).  Stronger than the dozens of minotaurs he has already faced in the face, Alleron manages to overcome them, and returns to the people to find they are free. He then proceeds to the lair of Talinthraxus, parting ways with the helpful coyote. The mighty dragon proves to be a powerful adversary, but Alleron defeats and slays him, finally escaping the City of Magic. As he arrives at the Monastery of Enroth, it is immediately apparent something is wrong. The entire Monastery has been overrun by the undead! A surviving monk explains that Daria has betrayed them and summoned the undead that are laying siege to the once peaceful place.  Alleron manages to kill all of the undead in the Monastery, and he goes to find Saelo. Saelo then explains that Daria is one of the offspring of Einar, and that she was placed in his care. He had tried to turn her from her ways, but to no avail. Daria had dabbled in witchcraft in it's darkest form: necromancy. He explains that everything that has been happening has been according to prophecy, and that now, according to prophecy, Daria will attempt to resurrect Daglathor, an evil spirit creature who was sealed away in a volcano by the Ancients.   According to Saelo, it is foretold that only Alleron can stop Daria. He then hands Alleron a potion, commanding him to drink it. As he does, he looks into a mirror, seeming to come to the realization of who he really is, a son of Einar. He then removes the mask, leaving scars in his neck where it's claws had dug into him. Saelo tells him to keep the mask, and that it will "bring him luck", and then sends him to the Temple of the Depraved.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>While exploring her house's attic, the little witch Wendy discovers a treasure chest.  Upon opening it, magical stones are released from their prison, and head to a castle which is suspended in the sky. The power of the stones upsets gravity, and the castle comes crashing to the ground, right on top of Wendy's house!  It's up to Wendy to set things right again![CR]Wendy: Every Witch Way is a combination of a side-scrolling platformer and a puzzle game.  As Wendy, players explore the castle in search of the troublesome stones that have upset gravity.  Wendy has the ability to control gravity herself  by pressing up or down on the control pad while jumping, Wendy will cause gravity to reverse in that direction.  Most enemies and obstacles in the game world are also affected by the gravity switching  you'll need to manipulate gravity frequently to progress through the game's different puzzles.[CR]Stars can be used to power up Wendy's magic.  For every star that she collects (to a maximum of five), her magic will increase.  Beginning with a small weak shot, you can power your magic up to a spread shot that fires in three directions.  The stars also act as Wendy's health meter  if you get hit, you'll lose a star, as well as some magical power.  Get hit when you have no stars left, and you'll lose a life.[CR]At the end of every world, there is a short bonus stage with Wendy riding on her broomstick.  In these stages, you must attack enemies and collect stars as Wendy automatically flies to the next world.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Debug Menu[CR]At the Title Screen, press the following buttons five times each: Left, Up, Right, Down, Select.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level Passwords[CR]The passwords will be listed in order of upper left, upper right, lower left, and lower right.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level Passwords[CR]The following passwords are for Normal Difficulty.

		<title_clean>Wings of Fury</title_clean>
		<plot>Wings of Fury is an action game with some minor simulation aspects, in which you are the pilot of an American F6F Hellcat plane. The setting of the game is the Pacific during World War II.[CR]It is your job to defeat the Japanese by destroying enemy bunkers, machine gun nests and barracks on a series of islands. Barracks and gun nests can be bombarded with regular bombs, while you'll have to use rockets to take out the concrete bunkers. After a successful bombing run, return to mow down the Japanese soldiers with your machine guns. You also have to sink Japanese battleships with torpedoes and engage in dogfights with enemy fighter planes.[CR]You start each mission by taking off from an aircraft carrier, which you'll have to protect from assaults by Japanese torpedo planes. Whenever you run out of fuel, bombs, rockets or machine gun ammo you can replenish those by returning to your carrier. Your carrier is also the place to repair damage to your plane.[CR]The Gameboy Color version of Wings of Fury has a toned down violence level. You no longer mow down Japanese soldiers with your machine guns, instead you bombard jeeps &amp; trucks. Also missing in this version are the Japanese torpedo planes and the small 1st-person view window. New are some extra manoeuvres for your plane like a barrel roll and a review of your ammo consumption after each mission. Using less ammo than allocated gives you bonus points.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level Passwords[CR]From the Main Menu, enter one of the following as your Mission Number:</plot>

The objective of the game is to kill the other team of worms with a variety of conventional and bizarre weaponry - varying from shotguns to exploding sheep.[CR]Weaponry[CR]Axe: Takes half of a worm's health off but will not kill a worm unless they are on one HP.Handgun: Only a maximum damage of 30; however, players get Five shots.Uzi: Does a maximum damage of 50.Shotgun: Very effective at close range and can fire more than once in a turn.Minigun: Upgrade to the Uzi and does maximum of 75 damage.Longbow: Can be used to knock opponents off edges. Players get two shots with the longbow.Prod: Does no damage and only moves the enemy a small amount.Suicide Bomber: If used, the worm will blow themselves up. This does a tiny bit of damage but also releases fumes that make the enemy sick.Kamikaze: launch the worm in enemy&#8217;s direction. Does maximum of of 30 damage.Air Strike: Missiles dropped from the air. The angle of the strike can be chosen and each missile does a maximum of 25 damage.Napalm Strike: Napalm missiles dropped from the air which will explode into napalm above the ground coving it in fire. Napalm is affected by the wind.French Sheep Strike: Exploding sheep are dropped over an area and do large amounts of damage.Mine Strike: Drops 5 mines onto the landscape or onto enemies.Bazooka: Shoots a rocket which is affected by the wind. Can use this to hit worms who are in difficult places or behind cover.Homing Missile: A missile that homes onto enemies. Players select the area to be hit, then the power. The missile will automatically home in on this position.Homing Pigeon: Much like the Homing missile but does much more damage.Sheep Launcher: Launches an exploding sheep. They jump around before they explode; they do a maximum of 75 damage.Grenade: The power and length of fuse can be set to ensure maximum damage. Grenades tend to bounce around a lot and are useful for hitting worms hidden in holes.Cluster Bomb: Like the grenade but instead the bomb explodes into smaller cluster bombs which also explode. Only does 15 damage per cluster bomb and is well, pretty useless.Banana Bomb: One of the most powerful weapons in the game! The Banana Bomb is much like the Cluster bomb but it separates into 5 smaller banana bombs on contact. Each of these can do up too 100 damage.Earth Quake: Shakes the ground causing worms to fall off ledges and sometimes into the water.Fire Punch: A massive punch that and is useful for knocking worms off ledges or into explosive objects.Dragon Ball: Very similar to the fire punch but the worm launches it self towards the enemy and therefore does not have to be next to him to make it effective.Dynamite: One of the most likely the most used weapon and it's very simple: Just place the dynamite and run. Does a maximum of 75 damage.Mine: Places a mine on the ground which will be set off by any worm coming close to it. Can also be placed on top of worms to explode instantly (after a small countdown).Sheep: Lets loose a sheep which bounces along the land and can be exploded at any time.Super Sheep: Much like the normal sheep, however the super sheep can be controlled whilst in the air.Aqua Sheep: The same as the super sheep, except this can go underwater.Mortar: This has a huge range but is very inaccurate. Shoots a cluster bomb which explodes into further clusters of bombs doing a maximum of 15 damage each.Mole Bomb: Let loose a mole which borrows into the ground and can be detonated at any time. Useful at creating a quick shelter underground or to flush out worms already below ground.Mail Strike: Drops five letters onto enemies.Mole Squadron: A group of mole bombs dropped from the air, which behave like any other type of strike. However, they can be detonated at will.Blowtorch: Used to dig through the ground to create shelter. Can also be used to attack other worms at close range. Does a maximum of 35 Damage.Pneumatic Drill: Much like the blowtorch but can only dig vertically downwards.Girder: Creates a girder which will protect worms from incoming attack. Can also be used to reach inaccessible areas.Baseball Bat: Can knock worms off cliffs and does a maximum of 30 damage.Ninja Rope: A rope that can be used to swing along the landscape and reach inaccessible areas. Normally has unlimited uses and can be used to escape after a weapon has been places (mostly dynamite). Players can also drop weapons while using the ninja rope.Bungee: Used to bungee down the side of cliffs without taking any damage or ending the turn. Can be used for reaching inaccessible areas.Parachute: Can be used to jump large gaps in the terrain. Weapons can also be dropped while using a parachute. This is heavily affected by the wind.Teleport: Players select a location and then teleport there.Super Banana Bomb: Much like the banana bomb, but more powerful.Holy Hand Grenade: Much like the hand grenade, but does a huge amount of damage and can blow huge holes in the landscape.Flame Thrower: Shoots flames and does a maximum of 125 damage. The flame is affected by the wind.Salvation Army: Releases the forces of the salvation army (characters with drums). They move slowly along the ground and explode on their own after a while. Can also be detonated at will before this.Priceless Ming Vase: Places an ancient vase from the Ming Dynasty on the playing field which explodes.Petrol Bomb: Much like napalm, but on a much smaller scale. Once the petrol bomb explodes it releases fire, which burns the landscape and any worms present.Skunk: Releases a skunk. The skunk runs along the landscape and releases gas. This makes all worms in the area ill, causing them to lose health each turn.Scales of Justice: Redistributes the health of all worms on a team, making them all equal.Carpet Bomb: Releases carpets from the air which behave like any other air strike, but once they hit the ground, they can bounce and explode up to five times.Mad Cow: Launches a cow along the ground, which explodes after a certain amount of time. It does up to 50 damage.Old Woman: Players release and old woman that causes a maximum of 75 damage.Concrete Donkey: Drops a massive concrete donkey from the sky. Once it hits land, it stomps around destroying everything until it reaches the sea.Patsy's Magic Bullet: Fires a silver bullet that functions like the Homing Missile, however, its flight path is extremely accurate and much more sensitive to the contour of the terrain.Indian Nuclear Test: Causes the water to rise and makes everybody on the map sick, losing 2 health after each turn.Armageddon: Destroys nearly everything with a randomized meteorite strikes. Although extremely destructive, it is possible to survive this attack.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Extra Jetpack Fuel[CR]If you land before the jet pack fuel runs out you can change weapon, then change back to the jet pack and it will have full fuel.</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The game was dedicated to the memory of Owen Hart who died performing a ring entrance as the Blue Blazer persona.[CR]Attitude would be the last WWE game produced by Accliam, as THQ took over the license.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game retained the controls from WWF Warzone. Taking a more complex route than the WCW world tour series. The control scheme mimicked more of a fighting game, rather than a traditional wrestling game. The game required a button sequence to pull off moves. For example: Undertaker's Tombstone Piledriver required the following button sequence:Down, Up, Down, or Up, Down, Up (depending on location) + C Left on the Nintendo 64.[CR]Career Mode[CR]Using any wrestler from the roster you compete in 3 title runs, starting from the European title, Intercontinental title, and the WWF title, going through the list of wrestlers in various matches and different situations. After winning the title, you defend the title against the top 5 wrestlers. Also in the career mode, you can do a tag team career mode with a computer character. By completing the career mode, you can unlock more wrestlers and cheats, which can be accessed in the cheat menu option.[CR]Create a Wrestler[CR]The create a wrestler or C.A.W had a robust set of features. The player could choose from a wide range of options including : Gender, Attributes, Moveset, Entrances, and Taunts. Allowing the player to make their own creation, or closely replicate wrestlers not included in the original roster, or from other wrestling organizations. Many fan dedicated CAW sites developed on the internet with formulas for wrestlers, and fictional characters.[CR]Sound[CR]The game received positive response for its sound. The game featured specific crowd chants, commentary from Jerry Lawler, and Shane McMahon, and wrestler voices. In IGN's reviewthey claimed "The audio elements of Attitude are outstanding top to bottom. It's not necessarily the quality that got to us, but the variety of bits and depth of the samples that made us take notice."[CR]Playable Roster[CR]Al SnowBig Boss ManBilly GunnBradshawBrian ChristopherChristianD'Lo BrownDr. DeathDrozEdgeFaarooqGangrelThe GodfatherGoldustHeadbanger MoshHeadbanger ThrasherJeff JarrettKaneKen ShamrockMankindMark HenryOwen HartRoad DoggThe RockSteve AustinSteve BlackmanTriple HThe UndertakerVal VenisX-PacChyna (Secret Character)"Head" (Secret Character)Jacqueline (Secret Character)Jerry "The King" Lawler (Secret Character)Kurrgan (Secret Character)Marc Mero (Secret Character)Paul Bearer (Secret Character)Sable (Secret Character)Sgt.

		<title_clean>WWF Betrayal</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]WWF Betrayal marks the first attempt made at bringing the world of the WWF/WWE into video games outside of the pro wrestling genre. An old-school brawler at heart, it was released for the Game Boy Color months after the launch of the Game Boy Advance, and as such did not garner very much attention. To date, only one other attempt has been made at bringing the WWE license to other games with WWE Crush Hour, which is an altogether different genre and bears no relationship to WWF Betrayal aside from the licensing.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]You are the WWF World Heavyweight Champion, and during an ordinary title defence, you lose the Championship to your opponent thanks to outside interference. You head backstage to get a piece of the perpetrators, where you learn that Stephanie McMahon has been kidnapped! To make matters worse, the guys who orchestrated your loss are also the ones who kidnapped Stephanie! Vince McMahon, Stephanie's father and owner of the WWF asks you to save her, and in exchange offers you a rematch for the WWF Championship. Caring not for Stephanie's welfare, you set out anyways in hopes of reclaiming what is rightfully yours: the WWF Championship.[CR]Unfortunately, your foes have planned ahead and have stationed guards at every corner just waiting to take you out. What's a WWF Superstar to do? Why, do what he does best: destroy the competition. Chase your targets through the city and beat anything that stands in your way to a pulp, and you just might come out of this with the championship belt around your waist![CR]Due to the nature of the game, the plot was designed to be completely interchangeable so that no matter which wrestler the player selected, the others would still play a part. Thus, the identities of the perpetrators change depending on who you select. The storyline sees significant changes if you select Triple H; since he was married to Stephanie McMahon at the time of the game's release, he would naturally have an actual interest in rescuing Stephanie in addition to reclaiming the WWF Championship.[CR]Now choose a WWF Superstar and get ready to rumble! The Rock, "Stone Cold" Steve Austin, Triple H, and the Undertaker are all ready for action. Punch, kick, and use weapons to build momentum and then deliver your finishing move to take out your opponents with style![CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] is almost always on the repetitive side in beat-'em-ups, but perhaps more so in WWF Betrayal than others of the genre. The game rewards successive moves with "momentum", so the fastest and best way to thrash foes is to punch and kick them repeatedly and use a finisher. Your wrestler also a running dropkick, to be used at your leisure. Discarded weapons can be obtained and used to great effect, but only until you sustain your next hit.[CR]Taking a page directly from the WWE's playbook, where no wrestler is ever down and out for long, the traditional life meter "bottoms out" early before it empties entirely, dazing your wrestler but allowing him to recover hit points to a manageable level via button mashing. Skilled players can greatly extend the length of each life by watching this meter carefully, which is fortunate since some enemies possess long-range attacks that can drain nearly the entire bar in just a few seconds. Losing a life means you have to start over all the way at the beginning of the level.[CR]You will encounter bosses at the end of each level, each one being one of the wrestlers you didn't select, rest assured they are more difficult to defeat than any ordinary baddie. Still, the same set of tricks works on them too, so long as you can outlast them.[CR][B]Reception:[/B][CR]Due to the waning interest in the Game Boy Color at the time of release, the experimental nature of the game, repetitive gameplay and simple character animation, WWF Betrayal failed to garner very much interest and received harsh scores from review publications.[CR]</plot>

		<title_clean>WWF WrestleMania 2000</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]WWF WrestleMania 2000 used the AKI engine, previously seen in the studios prior wrestling games under the WCW brand ( WCW/nWo: World Tour and WCW/nWo Revenge) and as a result used many of the same buttons to perform the same moves. The D-pad is used to move, the control stick taunts, and the c-buttons can run and change targets. L dodges and R blocks. Pressing these at the last possible moment before being attacked initiates a counter move. A and B can grapple and strike respectively. Holding the buttons down perform stronger versions. After grappling, the player can use A or B and the d-pad to attempt different moves. These can be reversed with the R button.[CR]In the match itself, there is no health bar, but the wrestlers will begin to slouch, limp or hold a damaged limb. There is a momentum meter, however, which pulses more brightly and harder as moves and taunts are performed and gets slower and duller as damage is inflicted. Once the meter is maximized, a taunt will bring the wrestler into a sort of "rage" mode in which they can't be pinned or made to submit, their moves do significantly more damage and they can perform their devastating finisher.[CR][B]Modes:[/B][CR]The game featured a prominent story mode which had no branching storyline, but accurately recorded wins and losses rather than having the match won or lost based on the plot. The story generally followed the major story lines of WWF television leading up to the previous WrestleMania.[CR]There is also an Exhibition Mode, in which any match may be set up with any wrestlers. The matches include standard wrestling fare, though it was notable at the time for including a Cage Match and a First Blood, as neither of the WCW games had either.[CR]It is the also first western THQ wrestling game to feature a create-a-wrestler mode rather than a simple costume change. The mode is extensive, allowing customization of appearance, taunts, entrances and a move-set. Once a wrestler is created, the player can enter them in the Story Mode. The create-a-wrestler mode also allows the default wrestlers' costumes to be edited with four different templates for alternate costumes (or in the case of Mankind, alternate wrestlers) with the same moves. The default wrestlers' moves couldn't be changed.[CR]There is even a create-a-belt feature in which you design the look of a belt and put them up for grabs in Exhibition matches. Up to ten belts can be created and customized.[CR]Playable Roster[CR]Al SnowBig Boss ManThe Big ShowThe Blue MeanieBradshawBrian ChristopherChazChris JerichoChristianChynaDebraD'Lo BrownDrozEdgeFaarooqGangrelGerald BriscoThe GodfatherHardcore HollyIvoryJacquelineJeff HardyJeff JarrettJerry "The King" LawlerJim RossKaneKen ShamrockMankind / Cactus Jack / Dude LoveMark HenryMatt HardyMeatMichael HayesMideonMr. AssPat PattersonPaul BearerPrince AlbertRoad DoggThe RockScott TaylorShane McMahonShawn MichaelsStephanie McMahonSteve BlackmanStone Cold Steve AustinTerri RunnelsTestThrasherToriTriple HThe UndertakerVal VenisVince McMahonVisceraX-Pac[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Championship Passwords[CR]With these passwords you will only be two matches away from fighting the last opponent of this game, Vince McMahon:[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Championship Passwords[CR]Enter the following codes at the password screen...[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Championship Passwords[CR]Enter the following codes at the password screen...[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Championship Passwords[CR]Enter the following codes at the password screen...[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Championship Passwords[CR]Enter the following codes at the password screen...</plot>

[CR]There are 4 main things that Wolvie can achieve: [CR]1) Hack and slash with his claws (the main attack)[CR]2) Jump (very important to get through levels)[CR]3) Heal (stay still, and he will heal a little at a time. Just be careful, each level has a limited amount of time to complete, so don't stand around too much)[CR]and 4) If you press the attack button (see (1)) several times in a row, Wolvie will go off in a rage. Although hard to control in this state, his attack range improves. He also loses a little health every time)[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Brown-Orange Suit and Faster Healing[CR]On the title screen, press up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A. You'll have the Brown-Orange suit that Wolverine wore in some comics. Also, it regenerates health faster.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Brown-Orange Suit and Faster Healing[CR]At the title screen, when the words ''Press Start'' appear, press Up, Up, Up, Up, Down, Down, Down, Down, Left, Left, Left, Left, Right, Right, Right, Right, B, A.

		<title_clean>Yars' Revenge</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR]Backstory[CR]The Yars are the game's protagonist. They are essentially giant mutated House Flies in the far future. Throughout the game the Yars are battling mysterious and presumably evil aliens called Qotile. The Yars had three home planets before the Qotile attacked and destroyed one of them without warning. This set the Yars on a quest for revenge against the alien Qotile to protect their remaining two planets from harm. [CR][B]Controls:[/B][CR]You fly around the screen with the joystick and shoot your cannon with the fire button. The Yar will fire in the direction he is moving, making it not only possible to fire vertically but also horizontally. One of the reasons Yars' Revenge was so popular was because of its tight controls. The movement of the Yars is quick and allows diagonal movement. Because of this, Yars can easily outmaneuver enemies even if you can't outrun them.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR] The "neutral zone" can be clearly seen here.[CR]The alien Qotile manuevers up and down the right side of the screen and will attack the Yars behind its shield. It pulses in a cyclic pattern of colors, and upon reaching a specific point in the cycle it turns into the lethal "Swirl" which will spin for a couple seconds before launching itself directly at the Yar. Initially, it only activates when the Quotile turns red, but as your score increases, it will activate three times in the color cycle.[CR]In order to destroy the Qotile, you must eat away at or shoot the shield until you can get through to the Qotile to destroy it. There are two weapons at your disposal, an energy missile fired by the Yar itself (sometimes lovingly called a 'spitwad') which is useful for wearing down the shield, and the "Zorlon Cannon," an orbital cannon that is the only weapon that can destroy the Quotile. It is represented by a small scintillating rectangle on the left side of the screen which follows your vertical movement, in effect using the Yar itself as the targeting system. Once charged, the Zorlon Cannon can be fired by pressing the fire button, replacing the spitwad. If the Cannon touches either the Quotile or the Swirl, it is destroyed and you continue to the next level; otherwise it dissipates and the cannon charge is lost. Destroying the Swirl while it is in flight will net you an additional life.[CR]There are a couple difficulty modes which affect the gameplay, primarily affecting the Zorlon Cannon. At the easiest difficulty, simply eating a few chunks of the Quotile's shield or touching the Quotile itself will charge the cannon, causing it to appear on the left side of the screen. When fired, it will disappear if it hits either the shield, taking a piece off of it, or the far right of the screen. The second variation causes the cannon to reflect if it strikes the shield, and will kill the Yar if it hits it on the return path.[CR]The final variation, called 'Ultimate Yar' and by far the most fun, requires you to 'kiss' the left side of the playing field to charge the cannon after collecting energy. Five energy units are needed, and you get one for each shield chunk eaten, two for touching the Quotile, and four for catching the cannon after it reflects off the shield (which is not lethal in this mode). This means if you miss a gap in the shield, you can catch the cannon's blast and recharge the cannon quickly for a second try. Due to a programming flaw however, if you get 256 energy points it rolls over to zero.[CR]The obstacles the Yars face include homing missiles and the Qotile's "swirl" attack. There is a "neutral zone" roughly in the middle of the screen. This zone provides protection from those pesky homing missiles but not from the other big threat, Qotile's "swirl" attack. As you progress through the game and rack up higher score, the Swirls not only get faster, but their attacks become more frequent and complex as well. Here is a chart showing the progression of the swirl attack based on current score:ScoreShield ColorChange In Swirl pattern70,000BlueSwirls triple in frequency (Red, Blue, Green).Sometimes fire instantly.150,000GraySwirls back to normal frequency, but they now change direction mid-flight.230,000PinkThree swirls again, with mid-flight direction changes. They sometimes fire instantly.[CR]Yars are also unable to attack while in the neutral zone, so it's not somewhere you want to hang out all the time. Levels become increasingly fast as you move from stage to stage in order to increase difficulty, but there is no final level. The game will continue to produce levels until you run out of lives. The max score you can obtain in the game is 999,999 points. At that point you can consider yourself a master Yars' Revenge player, there's really nowhere to go from there. Here is another chart explaining how points can be scored:[CR] ActionPoints Scored Shield cell hit by missile 69 points Shield cell devoured by Yars 69 points and 100 bonus points Qotile destroyed 1,000 points Swirl destroyed in place 2,000 points Swirl destroyed in air 6,000 points and a bonus ship (life)[CR]Factoids[CR]The Neutral Zone and the explosion upon destroying the Quotile are machine code displayed as graphics for a quick-and-dirty effect.[CR]Yar's Revenge[CR]In November 2010, Atari announced a game named after Yars' Revenge for PC, PS3 and Xbox 360. It was developed by  Killspace Entertainment, and was released as a downloadable title on April 12, 2011. More reimagining than remake, the game is an on-rails shooter in which the player takes control of a heroine named Yar, who must fight off the enemy Qotile forces. Yar's Revenge features an aesthetic inspired by anime, with the developer having cited Studio Ghibli as an inspiration for the style.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>It's the 14th annual Jellystone Park Balloon Fest. And you know what that means for Yogi...campers with pic-a-nic baskets! Yogi has a plan to get those baskets. He'll pose as a balloon salesman. He just needs to avoid Ranger Smith.[CR]Boo Boo: "But, Yogi, the Ranger isn't going to like this."[CR]Yogi: "Not to worry, Boo Boo, I'm smarter than the average bear!"[CR]This is a puzzle game requiring strategy. A cloud above will hold several colored balloons while moving left or right. When it reaches the screen edge, it drops down a bit. You have a picnic basket with two balloons attached. By pressing the B button, you can rotate the balloons 90 and swap the colors. By pressing the A button, you release the balloons. The object is to get three balloons of the same color to touch. They will then pop and will be gone. Remember, the cloud is moving so time your release so the balloons go where you want. You are trying to clear all the balloons to move on.[CR]Every fourth level is a boss level where you have Ranger Smith on top of the cloud. He stomps the cloud to lower it and drops a stone. If the stone hits your basket, you will release your balloons, whether you want to or not, and will not be able to move for a couple seconds. Once you clear all these balloons, you will have defeated Ranger Smith and will move on to the next area. If you match a balloon with an arrow in it, the cloud will move up a little. If the balloons reach the bottom, you lose. You can then choose to restart the level you were on or end the game.</plot>

		<title_clean>Zebco Fishing!</title_clean>
		<plot>Zebco Fishing! is an officially licensed fishing game for the Game Boy Color. It features 11 different lures and 2 lakes to fish on. The player can participate in a tournament and Blackjack Bass. The tournament mode gives you a limited time to catch the biggest fish. In Blackjack Bass you have to catch 21 pounds worth of fish, similar to the game Black Jack. Each time you catch a fish, you get its weight and can decide to "hit" or "hold". If you exceed the 21 pounds you lose.[CR]The player can row his boat around the lake until he has found a suitable fishing location, where he can cast his line and wait for the fish to bite. Once a fish is nibbling the bait the player has to hook it and then reel it in. When you do so you must make sure your line doesn't break by keeping an eye on the tension. [CR]Weather conditions, time of day and location all have impact on the chance of catching a fish. Each type of lure also improves the odds in specific types of water and weather types. Somewhere in the two lakes also dwells the legendary Lochness Bass a giant fish which is yet to be caught.</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Holodrum[CR]The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons was released simultaneously with The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages, and the two of them make the seventh and eighth games released in the Zelda franchise. The player once again controls Link as he travels on an adventure to destroy evil and rescue Din. There were initially going to be three games released simultaneously, but the complexity of the system made it an impossible feat and the third game was cut.[CR]The development of the game was handled by a company called Flagship. This marks one of the few times a Zelda games production has not been handled first-party by Nintendo. Oracle of Season's counterpart game, Oracle of Ages, focuses more on puzzles whereas Seasons focuses much more on action and combat. The two games can also be linked together via passwords to unlock new items and other things otherwise unobtainable during a regular playthrough of the game.[CR]The release of the game was very close to that of the Game Boy Advance. The development team was unsure whether or not to include special functionality if a player plays the game on a Game Boy Advance, as they feared doing so might push back the release date and thus make the game come out after the Game Boy Advance. When the Game Boy Advance's release date was pushed back, it gave the development team the time they needed to incorporate the new functionality and still launch the game before the Game Boy Advance came out.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]In Oracle of Seasons, the Triforce drops Link in the land of Holodrum. He happens upon a traveling band playing in the forest and meets Din, the Oracle of Seasons. He then witnesses her kidnap at the hands of the evil general Onox. Impa tells Link that they were headed towards the land of Hyrule and tells him to find the Maku Tree. The Maku Tree tasks him with getting the eight essences which will allow Link passage into Onox's castle. What follows is classic Zelda gameplay as Link attempts to obtain all eight of the essences.[CR]The player, as Link, then proceeds to collect all of the essences needed to complete the game. After acquiring them all in a variety of ways, meeting both unique and flat-out strange characters along the way, Link gains entrance to Onox's castle. He defeats Onox and rescues Din. Koume and Kotake (also known as Twinrova) watch Link from afar, plotting their resurrection of Ganon. If Oracle of Seasons in the link game, however, then Koume and Kotake begin to battle with Link.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]A scene from early in the game.[CR]Oracle of Seasons is a traditional top-down Legend of Zelda game. In the game, the player (as Link) must traverse a variety of colorful dungeons to reach the ultimate goal of defeating Koume and Kotake (otherwise known as Twinrova) and rescuing the world from demise. Items and power-ups are collected on the adventure, allowing Link to do a variety of things, from jumping or creating blocks.[CR]One of the central items in the game is the Rod of Seasons. This item allows Link to change the season if he is standing on a tree stump. There are many things in the game which change depending on the season. Examples include lakes freezing over and trees losing their leaves.[CR]A new system implemented in Oracle of Seasons is the Gasha Nut system. By planting a Gasha Nut in fertile soil, a Gasha Tree will grow. The tree will produce fruit, which in turn will grant Link with an item of some sort (usually a Magic Ring, which can subsequently be appraised in a variety of locales).[CR]Like its handheld predecessor Link's Awakening, Oracle of Seasons has some short sections in which Link travels with a side-view (as opposed to the traditional top-down view). This gives off a more " Mario" feel, and some of the the enemies in these sections are actually pulled straight from Mario games, such as Cheep-Cheeps, Podobos, and Thwomps.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Character DescriptionImageLinkThe main protagonist of the Legend of Zelda franchise (although not necessarily the same Link in every adventure). In Oracle of Seasons, Link has been sent to the land of Holodrum by the Triforce. When he arrives, he meets Din and her traveling band. She is quickly kidnapped by the evil Onox, however. To save Din, Link must utilize the Rod of Seasons and collect all of the Essences of Nature to get to Onox's Northern Castle, where the final battle will be.Din[CR]Din is the Goddess of Power, one of the three goddesses who crafted the land of Hyrule. In Oracle of Seasons, she is the Oracle of Seasons. She is a dancer who is kidnapped by Onox in the beginning of the game, which is what most of the game is focused around.Onox[CR]Onox is known as the General of Darkness. He is so evil that it is said he causes the very ground he steps on to become infertile. In Oracle of Seasons, he is the person behind the kidnapping of Din and the misuse of her power to turn the seasons of Holodrum into chaos. He imprisons Din in a large crystal in his castle, and then used his power to send the Temple of Seasons into an underground world known as Subrosia, causing the Rod of Seasons to lose its power. He is also behind the many monsters that Holodrum becomes infested with.[CR]When Link challenges Onox, he uses a large flail to attack Link. When Onox loses to Link, he uses Din (still trapped in the crystal) as a human shield, deflecting most of Link's attacks. Upon his defeat, Onox changes into his true and final form; a large dragon called Dark Dragon. This boss fight is in the side-scrolling mode that the two Oracle games feature. Before his defeat, however, he manages to light the Flame of Destruction for Twinrova (one of the three flames needed).[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Advance Shop[CR]If you're playing on a Gameboy Advance, head to the screen with the Know-it-all Birds Hut. The other house thats normally closed will be open. Inside is a shop that has 2 rings, and a Gasha Seed. All 3 things sell for 100 rupees each. [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Advance Shop[CR]To find the noble sword go to tarm ruins in the area where there is a trunk in the middle of the screen change the season to winter and head west then change it to autum and head west again then change it to spring and head west again and finally change it to summer and head west there you will find the noble sword.</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Link and Impa in the forest[CR]The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages is a Game Boy Color game released simultaneously with The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons and follows Link's adventures through the land of Labrynna. The game is published by Nintendo and developed by Flagship. The two Oracle games feature unique connection options, allowing players to collect treasure and objects using a link-up or password mode.[CR]The developers intended initially to make three games, all of them representing one part of the Triforce. Upon realizing that this system would be too difficult they canceled the third game and decided only to work on Oracle of Ages and Oracle of Seasons.[CR]Oracle of Ages and Oracle of Seasons release dates were very close to that of the Game Boy Advance. The developers were indecisive as to whether or not they should add Game Boy Advance functionality to the game, because doing so might push back the release date and result in the game coming out after the Game Boy Advance launched. Luckily, the Game Boy Advance was delayed, giving them enough time to add the functionality and the games still came out one month before the Game Boy Advance.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]An example of the side-scrolling gameplay[CR]Oracle of Ages is a traditional Zelda game. Link explores the overworld, gathering clues and occasionally, items. After traveling about, Link makes it into various dungeons (eight dungeons are in this game, referred to as levels) and collects an item within each one that is normally used to go about the dungeon and eventually beat the dungeon's boss battle.[CR]A variety of areas in the game are not in the traditional Zelda style. Instead, they take a style more familiar with the Mario games. In these side-scrolling areas, Link can still use all of his items as usual.[CR]Introduced in this game are Gasha Nuts and Magic Rings. Gasha Nuts can be planted in certain areas around the overworld. After they grow, the seed on the tree can be opened for an item, normally a Magic Ring. Magic Rings can be appraised and then worn, for various effects, from transforming Link into an Octorok, to upping defense.[CR]The game makes heavy use of the Harp of Ages which opens up time portals to go between the past and the present. In the late game there are additional "Tunes" which don't require the usage of a portal to travel through time, allowing players to travel at will between the two times. There are many things that are changed between the two times. One example is that the Black Tower is not finished in the past, but it is finished in the future. Some other buildings also have slightly different layouts depending on the era.[CR]After finishing Oracle of Ages, passwords can be gathered in Oracle of Seasons which can then be told to various NPCs (non-playable characters) in the overworld. After telling the various NPCs the password, an item is presented to Link. Items vary from the Master Sword to a Piece of Heart. After collecting the item, the password given to Link by the character can then be used in Oracle of Seasons.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The game starts with Link dropped into Labrynna. After walking around he finds a woman flanked on all sides by monsters. Upon Link's arrival, the monsters run away and the woman (who turns out to be Impa) asks Link to help her find a singer in the forest. The two find the singer, who is Nayru, the Oracle of Ages, singing and playing her harp for the forest creatures. The demon sorceress Veran emerges from Impa and possesses Nayru's body which causes all time in Labrynna to go into chaos. Impa gives Link a sword and tells him to go see the Maku Tree, who tells Link that he must get the eight Essences of Time to rescue Nayru.[CR]After collecting the essences, Link faces Veran. The game doesn't end after the credits roll, unless Oracle of Ages is being played as a linked game. A cutscene is shown at the end of the game in which Koume and Kotake (better known as Twinrova) plot their revival of Ganon. A code is shown at the end of the game as well, and if typed into Oracle of Seasons when starting a file, the real ending of both games will be shown.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Character DescriptionImageLinkLink is the main protagonist of every official Legend of Zelda game (except for a few games on the CD-i, although those games are not technically considered part of the Legend of Zelda franchise). In Oracle of Ages, Link is sent to Labrynna by the Triforce, and then tricked by the evil Veran into opening seals that protect Nayru. Link then retrieves the Essences of Time and uses them to defeat Veran.NayruNayru is the Goddess of Wisdom, and one of the three goddesses who created Hyrule. In Oracle of Ages, Nayru is a singer. Her voice brings peace to all who hear it; which attracts many visitors. She is possessed by the evil Veran at the beginning of the game, and upon getting free, Veran possesses Queen Ambi instead. Link and her friend Ralph are both attempting to save Nayru from Veran, and Link manages to do so by using the Essences of Time.Veran[CR]Veran is the main antagonist of Oracle of Ages (although Twinrova is the main antagonist of the two games). Veran is the Sorceress of Shadows, and she uses her unique abilities to possess several people in the game (Impa, Nayru, and Queen Ambi). She first appears when she possesses Impa, and harmlessly requests that Link escorts her to Nayru. She tricks him into taking her to Nayru, and promptly possesses her. Link eventually tracks down the possessed Nayru, and manages to defeat her.[CR]Veran escapes, however, and proceeds to possess Queen Ambi. Under this new influence, Queen Ambi begins to build the Black Tower. Upon completion of the tower, she flees to the top floor. When Link manages to make his way up to the final battle, he frees Queen Ambi from the control of Veran. Veran finally transforms into her final form and flies around the room attacking Link. Upon her defeat, the Black Tower begins to collapse, but Link and Veran fall to the base of a tower. This is where their final showdown takes place, and Veran takes on many forms. Link manages to destroy them all, but not before she is able to light the Flame of Sorrow, one of the three flames that is needed to resurrect Ganon.RalphRalph is a friend from Nayru's childhood, and he assists in guarding her. In the beginning of the game, he distrusts Link, but as the game progresses, he begins to like Link more and more. He is a descendant of Queen Ambi, although he never mentions the throne. Ralph appears consistently throughout the game to provide his advice and opinions. He is resourceful and knowledgeable, making him an essential part of Link's success.Queen AmbiQueen Ambi (despite being under the influence of Veran for a large portion of the game) is the queen of Labrynna. Her one true love was lost at sea, so she began to build a large tower so that he could see it and return to her. If Oracle of Seasons is linked to Oracle of Ages, Queen Ambi is able to meet her lover.ImpaImpa is the protector and maid of Princess Zelda. She was originally sent to bring Nayru and Din to Hyrule so that the lands of Labrynna and Holodrum would be safe, but she fails at this quest when she is possessed by Veran. Link must then save these lands. In the beginning of the game, she is under attack by Octoroks, similar to the original The Legend of Zelda. After Veran leaves Impa, Impa gives Link a wooden sword (if it is a linked game, then she will give the player a wooden shield).[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Secret GBA shop[CR]To get a secret shop called the 100 rupee shop, put in your Oracle of Ages game into your Game Boy Advance and then go to Lynna Village in the past.  Then go to the screen where there is the sword aim game, and go to the door to the left of it.  When you get in their it sells 2 rings, one is a Game Boy Advance Ring, thats just for decoration, and the other is usually a peace ring which makes bombs not harm you.  Besides the two ring, you can buy a Gasha Seed, and when it turns into to tree, it will have a ring on it.  Everything is 100 rupees.</plot>
