		<emu_comment>Nintendo GameCube ReDump collection in nkit format[CR]The Nintendo GameCube was the first Nintendo console to use optical discs as its primary storage medium, after several aborted projects from Nintendo and its partners to utilize optical-based storage media. In contrast with the GameCube's contemporary competitors, Sony's PlayStation 2, Sega's Dreamcast and Microsoft's Xbox, the GameCube uses miniDVD-based discs instead of full-size DVDs. Partially as a result of this, it does not have the DVD-Video playback functionality of these systems, nor the audio CD playback ability of other consoles that use full-size optical discs. In addition, the GameCube introduced a variety of connectivity options to Nintendo consoles, and was the fourth Nintendo console, after the Nintendo 64DD, Famicom Modem and Satellaview, to support online play officially, via the Nintendo GameCube Broadband Adapter and Modem Adapter (sold separately). It also enabled connectivity to the Game Boy Advance to access exclusive features of certain games or to use the portable system as a controller for the Game Boy Player.[CR]Manufacturer: Nintendo[CR]Developer: Nintendo[CR]Media Medium: Disc[CR]CPU: 486 MHz IBM "Gekko" PowerPC CPU[CR]Memory: 43 MB total non-unified RAM[CR]Graphics: 162 MHz LSI (co-developed by Nintendo and ArtX, acquired by ATI)[CR]Sound: Dolby Pro Logic II[CR]Display: 640Ã—480 interlaced (480i) or progressive scan (480p) - 60 Hz</emu_comment>

    <plot>Building on 007: Everything or Nothing's range of strengths, 007: From Russia with Love is based on the 1963 film starring Sean Connery as James Bond. He is sent to Istanbul to acquire the Russian decoder machine known as the Lektor from a (supposedly) defecting Russian agent by the name of Tatiana Romanova. However, the Russians have no knowledge of this plan because it is a trap for James Bond created by the criminal organization known as Octopus. It is up to James Bond to seize the device and confront the dangerous assassin Red Grant and the ruthless Rosa Klebb.[CR]In most of the 18 missions the player progresses through linear levels while shooting everything in sight. The player can lock onto an enemy at range and cycle between visible enemies, or focus in closer on a single enemy to make opportunistic targets appear, such as uncovered grenades or gaps in armor. Sometimes Bond can also use stealth or hand-to-hand combat, which are basically quick-time events where the player needs to press a displayed button in a limited time to dispatch a foe. Special tasks can be preformed with gadgets, e.g. the laser watch or a small remote controlled helicopter. This procedure gets spiced up with occasional driving or new jet pack sequences.[CR]The player gets rewarded for certain actions with bonus points, e.g. succeeding in melee combat or searching containers. There are three different kind of points which unlock different things: bonus content like making of videos, bonus levels, and weapon upgrades. Every weapon and gadget can be upgraded in different areas, but only once.</plot>

    <plot>NightFire will feature an original single player storyline -- written exclusively for the game and borrowing from the rich 007-legacy that spans 40 years. As Bond, players will operate in the snow capped Austrian Alps and the far reaches of outer space as well as underwater in the depths of the South Pacific to defeat the evil criminal mastermind Rafael Drake, the popular head of a supposedly benign environmental organization who secretly is bent on world domination.</plot>

    <plot>One night, as Nemo sleeps, he is visited in a dream by the King of Slumberland, who invites Nemo to come and play with the King's daughter, the Princess. Nemo finds himself unable to find the Princess however, so he and 'Flip', a strange companion who also turns up in the dream, decide to explore Slumberland and find the king.[CR]Nemo is a colourful and abstract platform shoot-em-up set in the dream world of Slumberland, a surreal world in which childrens' toys are running amok and must be destroyed. Nemo is armed with a magical staff that emits a burst of magic to destroy the many enemies, some of which require multiple hits. A number of power-ups also appear at regular intervals to aid Nemo in his quest through seven tough stages.</plot>

    <plot>4x4 Evo 2 is a sequel to the 2000 release 4x4 Evo. This game is very similar to it's predecessor, but now it appears on newer platforms, and has more trucks, and many more tracks.[CR]The trucks in this game are licensed likenesses of trucks you may see driving down the streets of suburban America. You can purchase a truck in career mode, and then trick it out with custom parts to turn it into an off-road monster.[CR]The career mode from 4x4 Evo is again the main focus of 4x4 Evo 2. This time, crazy missions provide for an alternative to the races found in the rest of the game. For example, you may find yourself using your truck to track down lost gold, or locate misplaced outhouses.[CR]The GameCube version features four exclusive tracks and four exclusive trucks.</plot>

    <plot>Matrix (Gridrunner 2) is the sequel to Gridrunner. In this Centipede style game you play a retired captain of a starship, one of those who had won the previous war against aliens. You come out of retirement because the aliens are back, tougher than ever. Thus a second gridwar begins. You pilot your ship and shoot at chains of pods coming at you. As you hit the pods, they break into smaller independent chains. The aliens seem to have a sense of humor, though. Each pod in the chain coming at you looks like a...camel. Flying camels from outer space. As you start shooting the camels, you are attacked by guns from the bottom of the screen and from the left side of the screen. Even worse, a human traitor has joined the aliens, and when he appears on the screen, running across the grid on top, the guns get very accurate at shooting you. Luckily you can shoot traitors. Other twists include deflectors, which turn your bullets and even ricochet them back at you. The enemy fires back too. And as you advance in level, the enemy changes the direction of their attack. Not to be confused with Advance of the Megacamel which is also called Attack of the Mutant Camels in Europe.</plot>

    <plot>In ancient times, a powerful weapon known as the Soul Edge existed, and tales of it's power lured many. But Soul Edge was an evil weapon, and when Siegfried claimed it, he was turned into a creature named Nightmare. As time passed, Nightmare rampaged across Europe leaving a path of destruction, despite the efforts of other fighters. One day, a mysterious man carrying a scythe confronts Nightmare and splits Siegfried from his cursed form. He then resurrects the Azure Armor to carry on as the "Nightmare" creature. At the same time, a young girl Tira pledges herself to Soul Edge's dark power, and a woman named Setsuka swears to avenge her master. All the while new rumors of the Soul Edge spread across the world, causing many who had searched for it before to once more venture out...[CR]Soulcalibur III is a 3D fighting game featuring a variety of characters, each carrying a distinctive weapon and unique fighting style. The basics of the combat is a derived, in different stances, from a combination of Horizontal Attacks, Vertical Attacks, Throws, Kicks and a Soul Charge. Characters engage one another in 1vs1 fights that end when the energy of one side is lost, removed from the ring or run out of time.[CR]There are two major modes of gameplay. The first is Tales of Souls, which allows the player to select any one of 24 characters and travel through their individual story to search for the Soul Edge. Most of this mode is standard fighting, however there are choices to be made on the world map and actions to be performed during cutscenes.[CR]The second is Chronicles of the Sword, where a custom character is created and brought to serve in a war between three nations. Strategy must be used to direct units and defend important strongholds. Certain positions of the battlefield include "effects" such as increasing gravity or speeding players up or fighting in the dark. Most battlefield missions end with the capture of the enemy stronghold or a key officer. Gold is obtained which can be used to purchase a variety of content, such as new weapons and clothing.[CR]Finally there are minor modes of gameplay. One of which is Versus mode, which is a standard 1vs1 in which 2 players can participate. There are also Soul Arena and Survival modes to overcome specific challenges. On many of these settings, custom characters can be used, having been created from a vast selection of body parts and clothing. Bonus weapons, clothing, characters or content can be unlocked through meeting hidden objectives in either of the main gameplay modes or by collecting gold and spending it at the shop.</plot>

This means that it's a big game (several hundred locations), with a heavy emphasis on treasure-hunting and exploration. Unlike those games, however, the author has managed to create a much more coherent world - which doesn't stop it from also being a world that is very varied and offers a lot of surprises.</plot>

The game doesn't use a hard time limit but the so-called "juice meter": it fills up when performing stunts and if it gets empty, the level ends. During the game you level up your character in seven stats, e.g. speed and grinds. The game uses a "learning by doing" approach to this, meaning that the stat improves if you perform the associated actions often enough. There are also five hidden keys in each level which open up new areas within the level.</plot>

    <plot>Combine the many tricks and styles of the extreme sport, inline skating, with a Tony Hawk style system, complete with objectives and huge arenas, and you have Aggressive Inline.[CR]Progress through the career mode, where you must complete objectives (such as grind a certain object(s) to jump over large gaps and gain points) to open up further arenas, which there are 7 in all, and once your bored with them, you can make your own in the park editor. The game doesn't use a hard time limit but the so-called "juice meter": it fills up when performing stunts and if it gets empty, the level ends. During the game you level up your character in seven stats, e.g. speed and grinds. The game uses a "learning by doing" approach to this, meaning that the stat improves if you perform the associated actions often enough. There are also five hidden keys in each level which open up new areas within the level.</plot>

    <plot>Disc is a game of fast reflexes and clever thinking. [CR]Control one player against the computer or another person. The objective is to finish off opponents by knocking him off the platforms or by making the platform disappear by hitting the walls behind your opponents. Your weapon is a disc, which you can throw at your opponent or at the walls. The disc will ricochet off the walls, opening a wide range of angles and attacks. You can also try a direct hit at your opponents, as enough of these will eliminate him as well, but be careful - since it gives him a chance to block your disc, thus gain control of it![CR]As you progress through the levels, from Novice, through Disciple, up to a Great Guide, your rivals become tougher, platforms take longer hits to disappear, and there are more discs on the playing field.</plot>

You may choose to play as one of the current teams, or you can go back to the past and play as people like Nolan Ryan or Reggie Jackson. You can also create your own player and/or team.[CR]The featured game modes are Quick Play, Exhibition, All-Star Game, Season, Series, Home Run Derby and Batting Practice. Batting is cursor based, and you can choose between a power or a contact swing - for the latter there are even more options available, e.g. trying to hit the opposite field. Batting is similar in as you choose your itching style (every athlete can have up to six in his repertoire) and then choose the location.</plot>

    <plot>It seems like all gaming systems must have their Baseball game, as early as 1978! Indeed the RCA Studio II, the Fairchild Channel F, the Bally Astrocade and the Atari VCS all had their Baseball game![CR]he controls are similar to other Baseball games. The outfielders are moved with the joystick, though you can't move them after the ball is pitched. They're spaced a little oddly, so there's usually a gap in right field that the computer player manages to hit to more often than not. To pitch, you send the ball with the fire button and control its path with the joystick. To bat you simply press the fire button.[CR]The Bally's players are animated better, so if I had to rank this one by graphics, I'd place it as better than the Fairchild's version but not as good as the Bally's, based on overall look and player animations. Control-wise the Bally outfielders had a better range of motion, without the gap that the APF players can't seem to fill. At bat, it seems harder to get a hit on the APF than it does on the Bally and I don't feel I have the same control over where the ball is hit. Pitching is pretty similar in that you've got a lot of control over the ball after you "throw" it and it is fun to try to fake out the person at bat with wildly curving balls that they swing at anyway.[CR]You can play with a friend or against the computer.</plot>

    <plot>The 'black evil' has taken over the island, and the Maboo Tribe have called upon you to bring order and outcast the evil that has taken control. To do so, you must create your own creature and train it up, entering it into various competitions against the 'black evil' and working towards the main goal. As the competitions are completed, you will unlock new features to improve your own creature in speed, strength and general looks.[CR]The main reason to do so are the mini games which the monsters can participate in. While those rely on your active gamepad skills (mostly pressing a button as fast as possible with minor variations), the changes of success are dictated by the monster's statistics. So for example a dragon would be beneficial for a flying mini game. Those statistics can be further enhanced with items bought at shops.[CR]Play single and multiplayer battles on the GameCube, or upload your creatures to the Game Boy Advance, taking them on the road to challenge your friends and unlocking unique items and features for the creatures you design.</plot>

    <plot>Hollywood is in an uproar - the Edgar awards for films have been stolen! The culprit is none other than C.C. Deville, who is threatening to melt down the Edgars unless he gets a ten-picture deal from Warner Bros.! Deville arrives in his airship, but accidentally crashes into the Water Tower, scattering the Edgars across the various movie lot and freeing Yakko, Wakko, and Dot at the same time. Help the Warners reclaim the Edgars![CR]Animaniacs: The Great Edgar Hunt is a 3D platformer where the player controls Yakko, Wakko, and Dot. Each character has their own special skills that can be unlocked as players progress through the game. For example, Dot can limbo under low walls, Wakko can dig tunnels in soft earth, and Yakko can bomb weak walls. Players progress further through the game by collecting Edgar awards which open up more areas in the Warner Movie Lots. There are also 300 collectibles in each world; players are awarded one Edgar at 150 collectibles and another at 300.[CR]In addition to this, there are also bonus mini-games guest starring Pinky and The Brain. Each of their short games features another failed attempt at world domination. The game also has the original cast of the cartoon reprising their roles for the game. There are also plenty of movie parodies, and it also takes the opportunity to riff a couple of video games as well.</plot>

    <plot>Hollywood is in an uproar - the Edgar awards for films have been stolen! The culprit is none other than C.C. Deville, who is threatening to melt down the Edgars unless he gets a ten-picture deal from Warner Bros.! Deville arrives in his airship, but accidentally crashes into the Water Tower, scattering the Edgars across the various movie lot and freeing Yakko, Wakko, and Dot at the same time. Help the Warners reclaim the Edgars![CR]Animaniacs: The Great Edgar Hunt is a 3D platformer where the player controls Yakko, Wakko, and Dot. Each character has their own special skills that can be unlocked as players progress through the game. For example, Dot can limbo under low walls, Wakko can dig tunnels in soft earth, and Yakko can bomb weak walls. Players progress further through the game by collecting Edgar awards which open up more areas in the Warner Movie Lots. There are also 300 collectibles in each world; players are awarded one Edgar at 150 collectibles and another at 300.[CR]In addition to this, there are also bonus mini-games guest starring Pinky and The Brain. Each of their short games features another failed attempt at world domination. The game also has the original cast of the cartoon reprising their roles for the game. There are also plenty of movie parodies, and it also takes the opportunity to riff a couple of video games as well.</plot>

While primarily a BMX-based action sports title, it earned most of its notoriety for containing nudity, foul language and adult humor. The game allows the player to create female characters that are fully topless and view live-action video clips of real life strippers, also with bare breasts. Consequently, BMX XXX was initially denied classification in Australia. In North America, while the game is available uncensored on the GameCube and Xbox, all naked breasts are covered in the PlayStation 2 version. While the adult content garnered a great deal of publicity for the game, it was almost entirely negative, and it was eventually released to dismal reviews and poor sales.</plot>

    <plot>The drug ecstasy is flowing into Miami, and the police want it stopped. Police Detective Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence) and his partner, Mike Lowrey (Will Smith), are just the men to do it. They track the drugs to a Cuban smuggler, Johnny Tapia (Jordi Molla), who is also involved in a bloody war with Russian and Haitian mobsters. If that isn't bad enough, there's tension between the two cops because Lowrey is romantically involved with Burnett's sister, Syd (Gabrielle Union).</plot>

    <year>1978</year>
    <plot>It seems like all gaming systems must have their Baseball game, as early as 1978! Indeed the RCA Studio II, the Fairchild Channel F, the Bally Astrocade and the Atari VCS all had their Baseball game![CR]he controls are similar to other Baseball games. The outfielders are moved with the joystick, though you can't move them after the ball is pitched. They're spaced a little oddly, so there's usually a gap in right field that the computer player manages to hit to more often than not. To pitch, you send the ball with the fire button and control its path with the joystick. To bat you simply press the fire button.[CR]The Bally's players are animated better, so if I had to rank this one by graphics, I'd place it as better than the Fairchild's version but not as good as the Bally's, based on overall look and player animations. Control-wise the Bally outfielders had a better range of motion, without the gap that the APF players can't seem to fill. At bat, it seems harder to get a hit on the APF than it does on the Bally and I don't feel I have the same control over where the ball is hit. Pitching is pretty similar in that you've got a lot of control over the ball after you "throw" it and it is fun to try to fake out the person at bat with wildly curving balls that they swing at anyway.[CR]You can play with a friend or against the computer.</plot>

    <plot>Disc is a game of fast reflexes and clever thinking. [CR]Control one player against the computer or another person. The objective is to finish off opponents by knocking him off the platforms or by making the platform disappear by hitting the walls behind your opponents. Your weapon is a disc, which you can throw at your opponent or at the walls. The disc will ricochet off the walls, opening a wide range of angles and attacks. You can also try a direct hit at your opponents, as enough of these will eliminate him as well, but be careful - since it gives him a chance to block your disc, thus gain control of it![CR]As you progress through the levels, from Novice, through Disciple, up to a Great Guide, your rivals become tougher, platforms take longer hits to disappear, and there are more discs on the playing field.</plot>

In addition, players will learn about the origins of the world itself and why the Lost Ocean is returning. The hero, a blue-haired young man named Sagi, was sent to assassinate the Emperor but found the job had been done for him. Blamed for the death, he's now on the run with two friends - a robot named Guillo and a young woman named Milly. In the initial stages, the player's party will progress in a linear fashion, moving from one area to the next along a set path. After playing the game for a few hours, players will acquire a ship that lets them visit areas in the order of their choosing, allowing them to either pursue optional side quests or blast through the main mission as they see fit. Unlike traditional RPGs, where characters gain levels in categories such as strength and agility, the majority of leveling-up occurs by procuring better Magnus cards. There are more than 600 different Magnus cards in Baten Kaitos Origins, some of which have truly fantastical properties. Players can acquire cards in many different ways, including trading, buying, winning as spoils of war or by creating them themselves.</plot>

    <plot>In this adaptation of the film of the same name, the origins of the Batman legend are explored. Playing as both Bruce Wayne and his alter-ego, Batman, you will need to hunt evil forces in familiar locations such as Arkham asylum, Gotham City, but also in the Himalaya. Using both stealth and brutal skills, you take on enemies in true beat-em-up style. Batman has a vast array of moves, from kicks and punches to more exotic special moves. Multiple enemies can be attacked at once, and there are tricks to break through enemies' defenses. Also, certain attacks can only be used as a finishing move when opponents are weakened. Next to the melee combat, Batman carries his Bat Utility Belt with a Batgrapple to reach higher areas, the Batarang and gadgets such as smoke and flash grenades, a lockpick, camera hacker and an optical wire to peek from behind corners.</plot>

    <plot>Beyond Good and Evil takes place in the year 2435 on the mining planet of Hillys, located in Sector Four, a remote section of the galaxy. The architecture of the city around which the game takes place was designed with a rustic European style. The world itself combines modern elements, such as e-mail and credit cards, with those of science fiction and fantasy, such as spaceships and anthropomorphic animals coexisting with humans. The once-peaceful planet is under siege by aliens called the DomZ that abduct beings and either drain their life force for power or implant them with spores to convert them into slaves. A military dictatorship called the Alpha Sections takes power, promising to defend the populace. However, the Alpha Sections seem unable to stop the DomZ despite their public assurances. An underground resistance movement, the IRIS Network, fights the Alpha Sections, believing them to be in league with the DomZ.</plot>

    <plot>Disc is a game of fast reflexes and clever thinking. [CR]Control one player against the computer or another person. The objective is to finish off opponents by knocking him off the platforms or by making the platform disappear by hitting the walls behind your opponents. Your weapon is a disc, which you can throw at your opponent or at the walls. The disc will ricochet off the walls, opening a wide range of angles and attacks. You can also try a direct hit at your opponents, as enough of these will eliminate him as well, but be careful - since it gives him a chance to block your disc, thus gain control of it![CR]As you progress through the levels, from Novice, through Disciple, up to a Great Guide, your rivals become tougher, platforms take longer hits to disappear, and there are more discs on the playing field.</plot>

    <plot>The game begins in 1933, in a place where it appears that the people believe in vampires, as all the doors and windows show crosses. It shows a man and woman running down a street. The woman trips, and the man pauses long enough to help her up, only to be dragged into a dark alleyway by a chain. His head is thrown from an alley at the woman's feet, with Rayne walking calmly up to the woman. The woman seemingly breaks down crying, but in fact only hides her face to reveal she is in fact a vampire. After a brief fight, Rayne decapitates her and then takes off before a small army of vampires tries to catch her off guard. She drops a grenade on their position as she leaves.[CR]On top of the buildings, two mysterious men, who were watching the events unfold the whole time, are discussing their reason for being here. One reveals they are here to recruit Rayne, who is trying to find where her father is. The other member does not want a Dhampir with the Brimstone society, regardless of the fact that she is only half-vampire and has fewer weaknesses, as the Society is trying to rid the world of Vampires (and presumably people with Vampire blood in them). Eventually they agree to recruit Rayne, and leave a necklace with their symbol on it (as seen on the game cover).</plot>

    <plot>Bloody Roar 3 is a 2000 fighting arcade video game developed by Eighting and Hudson Soft. It is the first of the series to appear on the Sony PlayStation 2.[CR]The gameplay (the controls) had six different buttons and the commands would be; punch, kick, throw, beast form, and side-step left and right with L2 and R2, which can also be done by double tap down or up to side-step. The main feature is still the ability to transform into beasts, which is involved in all of the Bloody Roar games. Once the character transforms, they regain all the health they have lost and become much stronger and more powerful than befor</plot>

The graphics are 3-dimensional polygons, but the action stays almost entirely in a 2-dimensional plane.[CR]The setting for the game is a space station that has been overrun by hostile aliens. You play as a bad-ass soldier dude who will single-handedly wipe the aliens out.[CR]You travel around each level in a non-linear fashion. You have to fight your way through endless hordes to find keys, flip switches, use elevators, and then ultimately defeat a big boss at the end.</plot>

    <plot>World" is a game in the tradition of the old mainframe adventures like Colossal Cave and Zork/Dungeon. This means that it's a big game (several hundred locations), with a heavy emphasis on treasure-hunting and exploration. Unlike those games, however, the author has managed to create a much more coherent world - which doesn't stop it from also being a world that is very varied and offers a lot of surprises.</plot>

The winner of the competition will then receive the grand prize: A pair of go-go boots studded with several diamonds. [CR]This version makes great use of the system's stylus, as it is mainly required to carry out several minigame tasks such as tracing patterns to strike poses on the catwalk, tracing skate figure shapes and a dogsled event. The console's built-in microphone is also utilised to give voice commands to the player's adopted pet in animal-based pet shows and agility races. DS Wireless Communications (both Single-Card and Multi-Card) also allow DS players to compete in several minigames and trading numerous outfits.</plot>

    <plot>Burnout is a street racing game focused around speed and crashing. Unlike many games which focus on closed course driving, you get to drive through cities with real traffic and city infrastructure. Designers have built an entire city and surrounding areas, and implement the race courses throughput the countie's streets. As a result, many times certain parts of race-courses interlace with other parts of other races. As well, instead of encouraging strategic driving and safe driving, Burnout strongly encourages offensive driving. Driving on the wrong side of the road, barely missing passing traffic, drifting, and jumps all add to your boost "burnout" meter. Speed boosts and jumps aid your attempt to dive past buses, trucks and anything else that gets in the way. The more offensive and dangerous your driving is, the more boost you get!</plot>

    <plot>In the Career mode, players progress through six geographical regions, each with several sub-levels. The regions are: Forest, Marsh, Desert, Prairie, Mountain, and Tundra. Each sublevel has a specific animal to hunt, though some animals are hunted multiple times on separate occasions, and occasionally the player will encounter other objectives within a level. Money is earned along the way, which can be spent on more-advanced firearms and other equipment. A few opportunities will arise for the player to win a gun by completing certain tasks. Some animals include: white-tail deer, timberwolves and peccary.[CR]Other play modes include Quick Hunt, starting with one sublevel per region; other levels become available as they are completed in the Career mode, and Tournaments, including skeet shooting.</plot>

    <plot>As opposed to previous games, Cabela's Dangerous Hunts 2 is more focused on survival rather than hunting. The player takes the role of a famous hunter traveling through many different types of terrain, trying to find out who or what killed his best friend. As with the first game, the hunter has a limited amount of energy and can be injured, which results in failure. There are many weapons, including handguns, rifles, shotguns, knives, and machetes. The game also includes many different animals including a boss, the Yeti. Unlike the first game, this one has only the story mode. During the plot, you're supposed to shoot all 80 stumps in order to unlock a "surprise," which has never really been identified by players, even after completing the difficult task.</plot>

Charge into battle together as Allied and Axis planes duel overhead, artillery explosions shake the ground and choke the air, and bullets and shrapnel streak past you and your squadmates. Experience war-torn Europe and Africa, from the blistering desert expanses of Tunisia and Libya to the beautiful yet deadly countrysides of Italy, France, Belgium, and Germany. You are thrust into the role and story of a member of The Big Red One, America's most heroic and decorated infantry division. Experience the camaraderie of a single tight-knit army squad, bound together through the chaos of battle over the course of the entire game. Yes, you will suffer casualties; you must not suffer defeat. Through all-new AI and animation, your allies (and your enemies) just got a lot smarter. Your squad will now make better use of environmental cover and tactical Maneuvers, such as flanking, envelopment, and fire-and-maneuver behaviors. Hear your allies reacting to the events on the battlefield with contextually accurate battle chatter.</plot>

    <plot>Capcom vs. SNK 2 combines characters and gameplay elements from various Capcom and SNK fighting games, mainly the Street Fighter and The King of Fighters series. Other elements, most noticeably different fighting styles, incorporated elements from other games as well, such as Street Fighter III, Garou: Mark of the Wolves, and the Samurai Shodown series.[CR]In contrast to the original Capcom vs. SNK, characters no longer have a specific "Ratio." Instead the player can select up to three characters in a team and give an amount or ratio (up to four) to each as desired. In console versions of the game, players can also choose a 1-on-1 game or a 3-on-3 game in Arcade Mode with the Ratio System removed.[CR]Unlike the first game, which was based on The King of Fighters-style two-strength, four button system of punches and kicks, Capcom vs. SNK 2 is based on the three strength, six-button system of punches and kicks, native to the Street Fighter series, and the SNK characters have been tweaked to fit the 6-button style. The overall system is derivative of Street Fighter Alpha. However, a number of different fighting styles called 'Grooves', which mimic other Capcom and SNK games, are included in the engine. These dictate both the character's Super Gauge system, and special techniques, such as dashes, running, and guard cancels, called "Subsystems." There are six in total, each designtated with a letter, along with custom grooves that can be programmed in home versions of the game. Each player designates prior to the match which groove his or her team will use.</plot>

    <year>2002</year>
    <plot>A beat'em'up with characters taken from many Capcom and SNK games. The game system is centered around grooves which are selected before any battle. These different grooves alter the character's abilities to resemble different Capcom or SNK games. There are three grooves dedicated for each company, and even the option to define a custom groove. The EO of the GameCube and Xbox titles refers to a new groove- Easy Operation. Instead of the normal inputs needed to do special and super moves, these moves are instead done automatically by tapping the right thumb-stick in specific directions. Only a small part of each character's moveset can be accessed this way, however, and if the player does not select EO then the game will play the same as the arcade and previous releases. Playable characters come from the following games- 1. Street Fighter (Ryu, Ken, Eagle, Sagat) 2. Final Fight (Rolento) Street Fighter II (Guile, Chun-Li, Blanka, Dhalsim, E. Honda, Zangeif, M. Bison, Balrog, Vega) 3. Final Fight 2 (Maki) Super Street Fighter II (Cammy) 4. Super Street Fighter II Turbo (Akuma/Gouki) 5. Street Fighter Alpha (Dan) 6.

    <plot>Another entry in the saga which began on NES.[CR]This game is based on the anime / manga Captain Tsubasa, precisely the "World Youth Team" Arc.[CR]It is a mix between a soccer game and kind of a strategy game (you choose action in a list) with added RPG element (improving player's stats).[CR]Like in the base material, soccer isn't really realistic (there is a lot of supermoves).</plot>

    <plot>Cole Gannon, a rookie in the ACME detective agency finds a set of GPS coordinates on the agency's computer server, which leads him to a museum in New York. The GPS coordinates involve a case dealing with the infamous thief Carmen Sandiego, who Cole wants to capture despite being still just in training. It seems Carmen wants to put back together a set of stolen tribal drums that will unleash an unspeakable power. [CR]There are two other ACME operatives, Jules and Shadow, who are working on the case in Siberia at the moment so they can only help Cole with advice through email messages.[CR]The game consists of exploring nine different locales all over the world from New York to Thailand. Each locale is broken down into several areas. Each area has different items to collect. The main items to collect are compasses. These will help in locating Carmen Sandiego's whereabouts. Another item Cole can collect are puzzle pieces. Collecting these will unlock a jigsaw puzzle for Cole to solve.[CR]Also for Cole to make his way through areas, he has to defeat some enemy combatants who possess key codes. A few key codes are needed to unlock forcefields, which block the pathways to get further into the area. To defeat enemies, Cole is equipped with a staff he can use to whack enemies with. He also comes equipped with a dart gun, which he can use to hit switches he can't reach otherwise. Cole must also move stealthily through each area to avoid security measures and to get a drop on unsuspecting enemy units. Cole has other moves he can perform such as pole vaulting with his staff, rolling from a crouch position, pressing his body close to a wall, double jumping, tightrope walking, and hanging from ledges, pipes, and even ziplines.[CR]During the game, players can access a menu with various tabs. The atlas tab gives educational factoids about the area Cole is in. The map tab gives detailed information about the area that Cole is currently exploring. The GPS tab gives information about where Carmen Sandiego will be heading next. The transport tab let's the player go back to the areas they previously explored in their current location. The communication tab lets the player receive messages from Jules and Shadow. .</plot>

    <plot>Castleween's magic formula: a pinch of horror, a dash of surprise and a whiff of fantasy. It's Halloween night and Alicia's and Greg's friends have all had a terrible curse put on them: their souls have been stolen! Alicia and Greg will have to cross over into the kingdom of the dead if they want to find their friends and free them from this dreadful spell. Help them complete 12 levels full of skeletons, vampires, witches, devils and other monsters which you will have to avoid and/or fight. If you're good enough, you will collect life and invincibility bonuses as well as precious sparks. You can play as either Alicia or Greg and, provided you have collected enough sparks, can change character whenever you want. But be careful, making a wrong selection can literally cost you your life![CR]Alicia can freeze water, lava and her enemies in their tracks. She can use her witch hat as a boomerang to attack her enemies and can also shrink herself so that she is completely covered by it. However, she is weak against heat. Greg can use his devil's fork to fight in kung-fu style hand-to-hand combat. He is also capable of executing dangerous triple jumps and he can walk through fire but is afraid of the cold.</plot>

    <plot>Chaos Field is a top-down space shooter similar in concept to the Gradius series, or Ikaruga. You control one of three ships, each with their own pilot and unique weapon systems. [CR]The game takes place over 5 phases, in each phase you face a number of boss battles. Unlike other games if this genre, almost the entire game is composed of boss battles, each boss requiring a different strategy to defeat. [CR]The game also uses a unique in-game difficulty adjuster. Called "fields", you can play in either Order or Chaos. Compared to Order, the Chaos Field offers you increased fire power and abilities, but also does the same for your enemies. Order Field is more relaxed on both sides. If you can play in the Chaos Field, you stand to gain substantially more points.</plot>

    <plot>Introducing Chibi-Robo, the four inch high rechargeable robot whose sole purpose is to make its owners happy! Accompanied by its talkative guide Telly Vision, Chibi-Robo makes its way through the dysfunctional Sanderson household, trying its best to make the family members happy. It won't be easy though - their daughter thinks she's a frog, the wife is furious at the husband for wasting money and makes him sleep on the couch, and if that wasn't enough, there are reports of spider-like robots out to destroy Chibi-Robo! Chibi-Robo! is a platform adventure game with a difference - players control a small robot called Chibi-Robo, whose short size means that regular objects like furniture and stairs become gargantuan obstacles for it to overcome. Its battery is consistently draining while not plugged into a wall outlet, and its power consumption increases when it uses tools like its blaster, copter or radar. Because of this, players must keep an eye on their remaining power and regularly recharge. The aim of the game is to earn Happy Points to increase Chibi-Robo's rank and become Super Chibi-Robo. It can do this by performing simple tasks (such as throwing away trash or cleaning floor stains like muddy footprints) or by making its owners happy, such as giving a rose as a gift to Jenny, the frog-obsessed daughter.</plot>

    <plot>The player plays the role of a VW Beetle car. The object of the game is to assemble two more VW Beetles while contending with hostile Choro-Q cars that intend to impede the player's progress. The enemy Choro-Q cars can be eliminated by jumping on them.[CR]However, the player has a limited amount of power (like a timer) to assemble the VW Beetles, which must be assembled in the right order; First, the chassis, then the motor (represented by a wind-up key), and lastly the body shell. When one VW Beetle is completed, it leaves behind a power-up (indicated by a coin-like icon with a dollar sign ($) on it) that grants temporary invincibility, allowing the player to plow through enemy cars.[CR]The level is completed by assembling both VW Beetles. The parts of the Beetles are on the edges of a three-level suspended platform system, and must be pushed off for assembly. The player can jump on the platforms to reach the parts.[CR]The player can lose lives by starting an assembly out of order, crashing into a wall at high speed, falling from a higher platform, colliding with an enemy Choro-Q, or being destroyed by an artillery shell. If the player loses all lives, it results in a game over.</plot>

    <plot>This was the first videogame based on C.S. Lewis' ever popular Narnia series of books which started with The Lion, The Witch, And The Wardrobe. The game came with the first novel, game cards and dice that are used in the gameplay. [CR]In the first episode, the witch has frozen Narnia and sent evil dwarves to stomp on flowers and beavers and to stop you from becoming strong. You gain heart points by touching flowers and beavers and gradually turn Narnia green again. You must get 10 hearts before time runs out. If a dwarf comes into contact with you, he goes into a battlefield with you where you roll the dice to come up with a number higher than the one it gets or you lose one heart. Edmund will appear occasionally and be powerless to go to the witch unless you intercept him or else the game ends.[CR]In episode 2, you are in an ice maze and must reach the lion Aslan. The witch will send crystals at you which if they make contact will take away a heart. There's three gravity chutes which if stepped on will send you to the bottom of the maze. You collect flowers for extra points and if you reach a door, you go to a card sub-adventure. The cards will have dice game such as the wolf Fenris Ulf will dare you to roll odd numbers or the witch Jadis will challenge you to get a higher second dice roll than your first.</plot>

    <plot>Conan: Hall of Volta is a 1984 action-platform computer game, designed by Eric Robinson and Eric Parker, and published by Datasoft.[CR]It is based on the character Conan created by Robert E. Howard.[CR]Released in 1984, the game's launch coincided with the debut of the sequel to the 1984 feature film Conan the Destroyer. The game's box featured a painting of Arnold Schwarzenegger as the muscle-bound warrior with his new costume for Destroyer. Despite this attempted tie-in, the game has little to do with the movie series except that it features the Cimmerian in the title role. This is due to having originally been designed without the Conan tie-in, as a boomerang-throwing game titled Visigoth. One of the screenshots on the back of the packaging is from a prototype version, and shows a boomerang instead of a sword.</plot>

    <plot>Crash is a two-dimensional maze racing game designed and programmed by Edward Valeau of Exidy in 1979. You "control" a car with no brakes which moves at either slow or fast speed through a maze containing dots. At the same time, one or more computer controlled cars run through the same maze in the opposite direction with the intention of ramming you. At each of four junctions in the maze, you have the option of changing lanes to avoid the oncoming cars. The objective is to pick up all the dots before the computer takes you out.</plot>

    <plot>Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex is the first Crash Bandicoot game for a system other than the original PlayStation. The story is set some time after Warped: Dr. Cortex wants revenge after being defeated by Crash (again). For this purpose, he creates Crunch, a super-bandicoot who can destroy everything that crosses his way. So Crash needs to defeat Crunch (and in the end, Dr. Cortex).[CR]The game is a typical jump and run, with some other action passages, like air combat and a sequence where Crash is trapped inside a giant sphere rolling around in some sort of rollercoaster. All graphics are in 3D, and the sound is typical for cartoon games like this. The whole game is pretty straightforward in design, getting stuck on a puzzle is not really possible.</plot>

For this purpose, he creates Crunch, a super-bandicoot who can destroy everything that crosses his way. So Crash needs to defeat Crunch (and in the end, Dr. Cortex).[CR]The game is a typical jump and run, with some other action passages, like air combat and a sequence where Crash is trapped inside a giant sphere rolling around in some sort of rollercoaster. All graphics are in 3D, and the sound is typical for cartoon games like this. The whole game is pretty straightforward in design, getting stuck on a puzzle is not really possible.</plot>

    <plot>Crash is a two-dimensional maze racing game designed and programmed by Edward Valeau of Exidy in 1979. You "control" a car with no brakes which moves at either slow or fast speed through a maze containing dots. At the same time, one or more computer controlled cars run through the same maze in the opposite direction with the intention of ramming you. At each of four junctions in the maze, you have the option of changing lanes to avoid the oncoming cars. The objective is to pick up all the dots before the computer takes you out.</plot>

    <plot>Cube is a puzzle game with action elements. The game is set in a cubic world with different stages and challenges. Players control a cube through tracks that act like 3D platforms and mazes. There are 135 levels based on nine themes in total.

    <plot>A sliding puzzle game similar to classic picture puzzle games however instead of completing an image you slide numbered blocks 1 through 16 into order. The game starts with the numbers in a scrambled order, just like in the picture puzzle. There is always one empty square into which you can slide one of the surrounding 4 blocks. The object of the game is to slide all the blocks back into their original numerical order. The problem is that since you have only one empty square to work with when arranging the blocks you inevitably place the puzzle further out of order in your attempts to solve the puzzle.</plot>

    <plot>Cube is a puzzle game with action elements. The game is set in a cubic world with different stages and challenges. Players control a cube through tracks that act like 3D platforms and mazes. There are 135 levels based on nine themes in total. The different themes (called zones in the game) come with their own contraptions and a specific colour. Dangers include bombs, creatures, sinking surfaces, rotating blocks, blocks that blow the cube backwards and more. Sometimes these also need to be manipulated to create new paths (e.g. moving blocks and then luring a bomb to blow it up).</plot>

    <plot>Curious George is a platformer based on the animated movie of the same name. Ted Shackleford, a human with a big yellow hat, visits Africa in search for an idol. This project does not work out, but he finds a new friend: the monkey Curious George. The game follows their way back to America and shows scenes from the movie as cutscenes.[CR]During the thirteen linear levels, the player takes control over George. The majority of time is spent with platform challenges which usually involve jumping or swinging over gaps. Frequently the levels are interrupted by mini games, Those involve simple tasks, for example rhythm sequences (pressing given buttons with the correct timing) or arcade sequences. Optionally the player can collect bananas on the way and receive special points by interacting with certain objects. Those are used to unlock bonus content: the cutscenes and mini games already experienced during regular play as well as a few hats for George to wear.</plot>

    <plot>Revolution is an action game with puzzle elements. The player controls a jumping ball in eight isometric levels and has to solve four (randomly distributed) puzzles in each. The principle is easy: There are two red blocks which belong together: touching one causes it to glow for a few seconds and during this time the other one has to touched, too. They may be in different height positions or move and the puzzle is to work out how to reach both in time. [CR]This is made more complicated by roaming enemies, which have to be avoided, and different grounds which may cause acceleration or breaking. The player can change how much energy the ball uses for jumping; this directly influences the height and bounce energy. Directions can't be changed mid-flight. The player is given 5 lives and must also contend with a time limit which becomes progressively shorter as each level is conquered.</plot>

    <plot>_Smash_ is a Breakout clone, where the player must bounce a ball to destroy bricks and keep it from falling off the bottom of the screen. The paddle is controlled with the touchscreen; the player can drag his finger to move the paddle, or tap the screen to quickly move the paddle there. There are two game modes, Challenge and Arcade. Challenge mode contains 120 levels divided into 6 "galaxies", and clearing out all bricks on a level unlocks the next one. The Arcade mode consists of a single level, with new bricks constantly appearing at the top of the screen, and the only goal to accumulate as much score as possible before a game over. [CR]As usual in _Breakout_ games, the playfield contains bricks of various types, which need a varying number of hits to be destroyed. There are also bonuses dropping down from destroyed bricks, such as multiple balls, temporary lengthening of the paddle, or creating a barrier at the bottom of the screen. Other things dropping down include harmful pickups which shorten the paddle or make it move backwards, and "M" points. The latter can be spent to buy upgrades that increase the number of lives available on a level, or improve the function of the bonus pickups.</plot>

    <plot>Revolution is an action game with puzzle elements. The player controls a jumping ball in eight isometric levels and has to solve four (randomly distributed) puzzles in each. The principle is easy: There are two red blocks which belong together: touching one causes it to glow for a few seconds and during this time the other one has to touched, too. They may be in different height positions or move and the puzzle is to work out how to reach both in time. [CR]This is made more complicated by roaming enemies, which have to be avoided, and different grounds which may cause acceleration or breaking. The player can change how much energy the ball uses for jumping; this directly influences the height and bounce energy. Directions can't be changed mid-flight. The player is given 5 lives and must also contend with a time limit which becomes progressively shorter as each level is conquered.</plot>

    <year>2002</year>
    <plot>In the action-oriented 3D role-playing game Darkened Skye, the player takes the role of the title character and embarks on a quest to collect four prisms that may help bring the light of goodness back to the world. Skye of Lynlora was just a restless shepherd when she first came across the strange item that would change her life forever. Now she has opened a portal to another place and chaos has come forth. Only Skye can set things right once again. She will face an assortment of fantasy characters and creatures in her journeys as she makes her way through 30 missions set across five different game worlds. It is notable that, like some other releases from publisher Simon and Schuster (including the Boston Animation-developed M&amp;M;'s: The Lost Formulas), this game features prominent product placement in the form of Skittles brand fruit-flavored candies. Indeed, it is the mystic power of Skittles that moves Skye through more than one threatening game situation. In spite of any potential incongruities of featuring a familiar consumer item in a fantasy world, Darkened Skye strives to provide the graphical competence, engrossing story, and state-of-the-art play that gamers expect from a major 2002 release. ~ T.J.

    <plot>Defender is an arcade video game developed and released by Williams Electronics in February 1981. A horizontally scrolling shoot 'em up, the game is set on a fictional planet where the player must defeat waves of invading aliens while protecting astronauts. Development was led by Eugene Jarvis, a pinball programmer at Williams; Defender was Jarvis' first video game project and drew inspiration from Space Invaders and Asteroids.[CR]Defender was one of the most important titles of the Golden Age of Video Arcade Games, selling over 55,000 units to become the company's best selling game and one of the highest-grossing arcade games ever. Praise among critics focused on the game's audio-visuals and gameplay. It is frequently listed as one of Jarvis' best contributions to the video game industry, as well as one of the most difficult video games. Though not the first game to scroll horizontally, it created the genre of purely horizontal scrolling shooters. It inspired the development of other games and was followed by sequels and many imitations.[CR]There were many ports to contemporary systems, most of them by either Atari, Inc. or its software label for non-Atari platforms, Atarisoft.</plot>

    <plot>John McClane is back. Many years have passed since his work in New York, and he now works for the Century City Police Department (CCPD) in Los Angeles.[CR]You are in John's shoes as he must face a new threat. Piet Gruber, the son of Hans Gruber and McClane's old enemy, is up to no good at the Townsend Art Museum. He has stolen valuable art and kidnapped John's now adult daughter and fellow CCPD police officer, Lucy.[CR]This game is a First Person Shooter, but it also adds two features: Stealth Mode and Hero Time. Stealth Mode allows John to sneak around quietly, even being able to grab his foes and use them as hostages. This means it may not be best to go in guns blazing, when they could be arrested. Hero Time allows John to react far more quickly, just like Bullet Time in Max Payne. Hero Time is earned by saving hostages and performing heroic tasks in the game.</plot>

    <plot>The game is set in the Digimon Data Squad universe, and revolves around the Seven Great Demon Lords. In this game the player will be able to control the four main Savers characters, Marcus Damon, Thomas H. Norstein, Yoshino "Yoshi" Fujieda, and Keenan Crier along with their respective Digimon partners. The graphics for this game are cel-shaded and the battle system is similar to the Battle Terminal (a Japanese-only arcade game). The game is classified as a "special genre", called a "Dramatic/Innovative RPG", which means that the Digimon partners are affected by how you, the player, treat them. The way your Digimon evolves will be similar to Digimon World; the Digimon will be affected by how you take care of it and, depending on that, will digivolve into different types of Digimon. In Digimon World Data Squad, a new type of digivolution method is used, called the Galactica Evolution System: this will determine what Digimon your partner will evolve into. There will also be new, original characters for this game, meaning that these characters are exclusive to Digimon World Data Squad, and will not appear in any other Digimon Data Squad media.</plot>

    <plot>World" is a game in the tradition of the old mainframe adventures like Colossal Cave and Zork/Dungeon. This means that it's a big game (several hundred locations), with a heavy emphasis on treasure-hunting and exploration. Unlike those games, however, the author has managed to create a much more coherent world - which doesn't stop it from also being a world that is very varied and offers a lot of surprises.</plot>

    <plot>Donald Duck was minding his business one day at his boring security guard job when the evil Evronian empire decided to attack Earth. A computer being known as One detected the invasion early, and teams up with Donald to turn him into the superhero PK.

This game is a simple 3rd person action shooter game. You control PK as he targets Evronian soldiers with his blasters, jumps through colorful environments, and rescues captured scientists.</plot>

    <plot>According to African legend, a human baby was abandoned in the forest. Found and brought up by a she-ape named Kala, he grew to learn the ways of the jungle and the language of the beasts. Years later, as John Clayton, Lord of Greystoke, he was brought back to England to claim his rightful inheritance. However, he occasionally returns to the wild to become Tarzan, Lord of the Jungle. Now is one of those occasions. Tarzan has returned to the jungle with his wife, Lady Jane Greystoke, but their holiday came to an end when Usanga, evil chief of the Wamabo, kidnaps Jane to force Tarzan into retrieving the seven gemstones that were stolen from his tribal shrine. These gemstones are believed to be the Eyes of the Rainbow, representing each color of the spectrum. Tarzan has been given three days to find the gemstones, otherwise Jane will be eaten by the tribal pet, Sheeta the Panther. After consulting his information sources, Tarzan learns that the Eyes of the Rainbow have been scattered around the dense jungle by a family of pesky chimps. Tarzan's quest involves navigating dark caves, crevasses, swamps, and treacherous quicksand. Objects, such as the rope and torch, need to be found if Tarzan wants to find each gemstone. Throughout the quest, hazards such asheadhunters, lions, snakes, spiders, quicksands, and pits are encountered. If Tarzan comes into contact with any of these hazards, he becomes stunned for an hour and the on-screen timer shrinks accordingly. Fortunately, he can punch creatures, allowing him to escape them. If Tarzan manages to find all seven gemstones within the time limit and deliver them to Usanga, Jane will be released. If not, she will become nothing more than another bowl of jungle soup.</plot>

Though Zeke handles his quest alone, he is aided by the help of Madame Leota, and six friendly ghosts who will provide hints and items throughout the journey. As Zeke solves puzzles, completes various tasks, and helps rid the house of its evil spirits, these spiritual companions will provide Soul Gems, which amplify the power of the Soul Beacon.

    <plot>Monsters, Inc.- Scream Arena is based on the 2001 Pixar film. Set after the movie, the employees of Monsters, Inc. now produce energy by making children laugh instead of scaring them. One good way of doing that is having the monsters knock each other over with balls, resulting in a dodgeball-like game. The game includes 13 characters and 7 arenas based on locations from the film. At the start of a single-player game, only 5 characters and the training arena are accessible, others have to be unlocked by advancing through the levels. There are 5 levels for each arena, for a total of 35 levels plus one final challenge. Selectable characters vary in speed and throwing power. Goals vary between levels and include scoring more points than the opponents, being the last monster standing, hitting a number of targets or holding on to a special ball the longest. Balls spawn on the ground and must be picked up and thrown at opponents or targets to score points, knock off one of their lives or free a held ball. To avoid being hit, balls can be blocked or dodged. Various special balls with unique properties exist. These include stun balls that knock out opponents temporarily, bubble balls that trap them in a soap bubble, yo-yo balls that come back to the thrower, pet balls that follow their owners around, and many more. Multiplayer modes include Buddy, which is a two-player co-op mode, Team, which allows two-versus-two matchups, and Party, which is free-for-all four a maximum of four players. Arenas and characters must be unlocked in single-player mode.</plot>

The Wii version of Donkey Kong Jungle Beat is somewhat changed from the original GameCube version, including new levels, modifications of old levels, and traditional controls that have the player use the analog stick to move and the A button to jump, unlike the GameCube version which required the player to beat the bongos to do both.

    <plot>Doshin the Giant is a Nintendo god simulation game for the Nintendo 64DD and Gamecube. It was originally released in Japan on December 1, 1999 as a launch title for the 64DD, for which a soundtrack by Tatsuhiko Asano was released on CD by Media Factory, early the next year. Both of these received positive reviews. An expansion was released five months later called Kyojin no Doshin Kaiho Sensen Chibikko Chikko Daishugou, which takes a very different perspective of the game, featuring short animated clips that the player can unlock after playing the original game. Doshin the Giant was later released and upgraded graphically for the GameCube and released in Japan on March 14, 2002 and Europe on September 20, 2002. The re-release received mostly positive reviews.</plot>

    <plot>Dragon's Lair 3D: Return to the Lair is an action-adventure video game released in 2002 by Dragonstone Software. The game is based on Cinematronics' 1983 laserdisc arcade game Dragon's Lair, and follows a similar story; the hero, Dirk the Daring, must enter the evil wizard Mordroc's castle to rescue Princess Daphne from Singe the dragon. Many of the characters and locations from the 1983 original make appearances in the game, along with new puzzles, rooms and enemies. Animator and director Don Bluth, who produced the cartoon animation for the arcade original, also produced two new animated sequences for the opening and ending of the game. The game uses cel shading to mimic the distinctive style of the original.</plot>

    <plot>Princess Daphne has been kidnapped by the evil dragon Singe and hidden in a medieval castle owned by Mordroc, a powerful and malevolent wizard. To save her, you will take on the persona of Dirk the Daring, a goofy but courageous knight. As he advances through the castle with the help of a magical amulet, Dirk must overcome a slew of challenges, from jumping over flaming pits and climbing ropes to flying across chasms and battling swarms of the wizard's minions. Use cat-quick reflexes, cunning and resourcefulness to solve puzzles, defeat a variety of enemies, and fight your way through the castle to find Daphne and save the kingdom from Mordroc's clutches.[CR]Dragon's Lair 3D is an entirely new, built-from-the-ground-up, three-dimensional version of the 1980s coin-op phenomenon. While it stays true to the design and storyline of the arcade game, it offers a massive 3D experience unlike anything else Dragon's Lair fans have played before along with unexpected twists for a whole new adventure.</plot>

    <plot>Egg Mania is a puzzle game in which the player controls an egg shaped character against either a computer opponent or another player via the link cable. The object of the main modes is to build a tower tall enough to reach a balloon at the top of the play field before the opponent does. If the player tries to take a short cut and not build complete floors, the structure will start crumbling and the water will come up faster. There are plenty of obstacles, both from the game and from competing opponents. Falling meteors can knock the player down into the water, while bombs thrown by the opponent will destroy parts of the player's structure. The main modes include Over Easy and Hard Boiled, the difference being that in the latter a different difficulty can be chosen.[CR]There are four extra modes: Survival, Solo, Time Trial and Bomb. In Survival the player must survive as many rounds as possible, while the goal in Solo is to increase the overall score by completing rows and performing combos; Time Trial challenges the player to continually beat his or her own best time; finally, in Bomb, whoever destroys the opponent's tower first wins.[CR]Compared to the GBA version, the console versions have improved graphics and sound, cutscenes at the beginning of each level, a play area that is wider by one block, two additional modes (8-player Tournament and Custom, where the rules can be customized by activating different options), but lacks the Time Trial mode. Otherwise they are completely identical, both in gameplay and level design.</plot>

    <plot>Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem is a psychological horror action adventure, released in 2002 by Nintendo for the Gamecube. It tells the stories of twelve characters that span across the world and two millennia who have to deal with ancient forces of evil which have been trying to manifest themselves in our world. Chapters take place in Ancient Rome, Persia, the Middle East, and modern-day Rhode Island. Throughout the game, the protagonists will have access to several weapons appropriate for their era, from bastard sword and gladius to flintlock pistol and shotgun.[CR]The game features an involved Magic system, which allows different spells to be created through the combination of runes. These spells can attack enemies, dispel illusions, and heal both the body and items.[CR]Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem also has a unique feature called Sanity. If an enemy sees a character, their Sanity meter drops. When Sanity gets low, hallucinations begin to plague the character. Walls bleed, voices whisper from nowhere, the camera gets disoriented. Sanity can be restored by dealing a finishing move on a dying enemy, or with spells or some items.</plot>

    <plot>The follow up to a previous Dreamcast RPG Evolution, and this title is a traditional RPG in every sense of the word. You are "Mag Launcher", an intrepid adventurer extracting treasures from dungeons for the Society, and trying to solve the mystery behind your father's death. Most of the game involves exploring multi-level dungeons, eventually confronting a boss creature to retrieve a treasure for the Society. On your journey you will be accompanied by healers like Linear Cannon, your gun toting butler, and others. Your weapons are what is known as "Cyframes" with upgrades being purchased to add more options such as slash and cannon attacks. The only character that uses actual magic is Linear Cannon, and all other characters use "FP" to perform their various special attacks such as Mag's "Crushing Hammer Blow". In addition, each character has abilities that can be used, but once used, will not be available for a few battles.</plot>

    <plot>F1 Challenge '99-'02 spans four entire championship seasons and features accurate team, vehicle, and driver data for each.[CR]Across the four racing seasons, F1 Challenge '99-'02 features 14 different teams, 44 different vehicles, and 17 of the world's most famous racing circuits--some of which have slightly different configurations, depending on the year. The level of detail on the visuals looks to be second to none, with each circuit boasting its own real-life structures, bumps in the track, motion-captured pit crews, animated grid girls, and planes and helicopters in the sky above.[CR]The cars in the game feature realistic driving physics and damage models that take into account the materials that the various components are made of. Fortunately, players have access to the same kind of data telemetry that real drivers and their teams do, so it should be possible to devise car setups that are appropriate for each circuit and so minimize the chances of crashing.</plot>

    <plot>World Cup (warudokatsupu) is a 1977 discrete logic soccer game manufactured by Sega. Two players use a trackball to move soccer players across the field and pass the ball or shooting a goal by pushing the trackball. If an opponent moves their player on top of the other player, the ball is stolen. The player with the higher score at the end of the game (which lasts from 60 to 90 seconds) is the winner. World Cup has kick off whistle, applause and cheering sound effects.</plot>

    <plot>FIFA Football 2004, also known as FIFA Soccer 2004 in North America, is a football video game developed by EA Canada and published by Electronic Arts. It was released in October 2003 with the tagline "Create Brilliance".[CR]FIFA Football 2004 is the eleventh game in the FIFA series and the eighth to be in 3D. While not adding much to the engine used in FIFA Football 2003, the biggest new inclusions were secondary divisions, which allow the player to take lower ranked teams to promotion attempts. Gameplay has a new feature dubbed "Off the ball", which allows the control of two players at the same time for greater tactical play. Another key feature was Football Fusion, which allows owners of both FIFA 2004 and Total Club Manager 2004 to play games from the management sim in FIFA. The title sequence was filmed in St James' Park, home of Newcastle United, with the opening song being Kings of Leon's European hit "Red Morning Light".[CR]The cover features Alessandro Del Piero of Juventus, Thierry Henry of Arsenal, and Ronaldinho in a Brazil kit.</plot>

    <plot>FIFA Football 2004, also known as FIFA Soccer 2004 in North America, is a football video game developed by EA Canada and published by Electronic Arts. It was released in October 2003 with the tagline "Create Brilliance".[CR]FIFA Football 2004 is the eleventh game in the FIFA series and the eighth to be in 3D. While not adding much to the engine used in FIFA Football 2003, the biggest new inclusions were secondary divisions, which allow the player to take lower ranked teams to promotion attempts. Gameplay has a new feature dubbed "Off the ball", which allows the control of two players at the same time for greater tactical play. Another key feature was Football Fusion, which allows owners of both FIFA 2004 and Total Club Manager 2004 to play games from the management sim in FIFA. The title sequence was filmed in St James' Park, home of Newcastle United, with the opening song being Kings of Leon's European hit "Red Morning Light".[CR]The cover features Alessandro Del Piero of Juventus, Thierry Henry of Arsenal, and Ronaldinho in a Brazil kit.</plot>

    <plot>Featuring a brand new engine (replacing the one used in five titles since FIFA 2003), FIFA 06 features new controls and gameplay, the most visible being more animations and better detailed ball and player physics and animation, the removal of the unpopular Off the Ball controls implemented in their 2004 version and remaking the free-kick interface so it's no longer obvious if the player decided for a shot on goal or a pass to a forward. Also new is the concept of "Team Chemistry" which affects how well a team plays collectively. [CR]Featuring 26 leagues from 19 countries, 29 real stadiums and over 10'000 players with data for the 2005-06 seasons, as well as international teams, the game kept the "Create a player" feature as well as the many managing options untouched from previous versions. Career mode, the 15-year long climb to the top of the game, features new options such as sponsorships (which will only accept good results), player contracts and more weight on the player morale: a demoralized player (usually from not playing or possible influence from random events) is more likely to under-perform as well as pressuring the "Team Chemistry" values downwards and might refuse attempts to renew his contract, leaving on a free transfer.[CR]While there are still many unlockables in the game (mostly third kits), the way to earn points changed. Instead of gaining points from completing tasks (from entering the EA Trax or creating a player to winning the Champions League or completing a career), the player has over 100 scenarios to way in five difficulty levels.</plot>

    <plot>FIFA 07 (also known as FIFA Football 07 and FIFA 07 Soccer) is the 2006 edition of EA Sports' series of football simulator video games. Developed by EA Canada, it is published by Electronic Arts.[CR]It was the last game in the FIFA series to be released for the GameCube, Xbox, and Game Boy Advance, and the first to be released for the Xbox 360.

    <plot>FIFA Football 2003, known as FIFA Soccer 2003 in North America, is an association football video game produced by Electronic Arts and released by EA Sports. It was released in 2002.[CR]FIFA 2003 is the tenth game in the FIFA series and the seventh to be produced in 3D. A number of new features were added to improve upon the previous version. Club Championship Mode was introduced with the feature of playing against 17 of Europe's top clubs in their own stadiums and the fans singing their unique chants and songs. A TV-style broadcast package gives highlights at half-time and full-time, as well as comprehensive analysis. One of the most anticipated new features was EA Sport's "Freestyle Control" which allows the user to flick the ball on and lay it off to team mates. Other additions include greater likenesses of some of the more well-known players such as Thierry Henry and Ronaldinho, as well as realistic player responses.[CR]The European cover features Roberto Carlos, Ryan Giggs, and Edgar Davids, representing Brazil, Manchester United and Juventus respectively. In the United States, Landon Donovan appeared in Roberto Carlos' place.</plot>

    <plot>Released only a few months after Euro 2004, FIFA 2005 brings several features to the franchise, such as the return of a player creation tool, where a player can be created from scratch from customizing the face (while it's not possible to define the texture like in previous EA Sports games such as NHL 2000, the player can customize the facial features such as shape of the eyes or the cheeks, in a way similar to RPGs such as Neverwinter Nights), accessories and playing abilities. It's also possible to create all kinds of competitions. The Career mode was also extended, allowing now up to 15 seasons, and giving the player the chance to turn the tide of a simulated match anytime. This mode is a "light" managerial mode, where the player not only plays, but also signs new players and increase the clubs abilities in trainers, medical staff and other club staff).</plot>

    <plot>The Fairly OddParents: Breakin' da Rules is a 3D platformer game based on The Fairly OddParents cartoon. The game starts with Timmy's parents leaving for a seminar weekend leaving the babysitter Vicky in charge. Timmy accidentally wishes he doesn't have to follow the rules from Cosmo and Wanda's fairy rulebook anymore. Cosmo grants this wish with the rulebook falling to the floor, but soon a news bulletin arrives that states that the first person touching the book will gain Cosmo and Wanda's powers. Moments later Vicky picks up the book spelling trouble for Timmy and the fairies. Cosmo, Wanda and Timmy are then summoned to the Fairy court. They are found guilty for losing the rulebook and are sentenced to retrieve the rulebook within 49,5 hours or lose their Fairy license forever.[CR]In the game you take control of Timmy Turner and have to retrieve the pages from the rulebook through a variety of environments ranging from cyberspace to a medieval castle. Gameplay includes platforming, defeating enemies and puzzle solving. As well as collecting wish stars (5 stars for a wish) and crowns (100 crowns for another change at a failed task). All levels are accessed from different objects in the house.</plot>

    <plot>Relive the movie experience with character likenesses, locations and villains from the summer blockbuster. Go beyond the movie with a completely original storyline that follows the movie story arch (penned by Hollywood writer Zak Penn). One or two players slip into the roles of all the members of the Fantastic Four and assume their persona and master their individual talents to solve puzzles, overcome obstacles and combat enemies. As Mr. Fantastic, use your ability to stretch in order to attack from a distance, squeeze into tight spaces and reach places no one else can. He can also heal, hack computers, and more. The Invisible Girl can perform stealth moves with ninja-like speed or immobilize enemies through telekinetic powers. The Human Torch can fly and create walls of fire and supernova fireballs. The Thing uses brute force to pick up objects or tear them apart, break through walls and obstacles and obliterate enemies.</plot>

    <plot>Relive the movie experience with character likenesses, locations and villains from the summer blockbuster. Go beyond the movie with a completely original storyline that follows the movie story arch (penned by Hollywood writer Zak Penn). One or two players slip into the roles of all the members of the Fantastic Four and assume their persona and master their individual talents to solve puzzles, overcome obstacles and combat enemies. As Mr. Fantastic, use your ability to stretch in order to attack from a distance, squeeze into tight spaces and reach places no one else can. He can also heal, hack computers, and more. The Invisible Girl can perform stealth moves with ninja-like speed or immobilize enemies through telekinetic powers. The Human Torch can fly and create walls of fire and supernova fireballs. The Thing uses brute force to pick up objects or tear them apart, break through walls and obstacles and obliterate enemies.</plot>

    <plot>EA's Fight Night returns in its second installment. Once again, you can create a new boxer and start a career that begins as an amateur in a shady gym somewhere in Queens, NY and fight your way up to the top. Alternatively, you could relive the careers of some legendary boxers. Of course, you could go for a simple match with either a computer or a live opponent. Round 2 offers many new features, like fancy particle effects that show blood and sweat spraying into the camera in ultra slow-motion. The "Total Boxer Control", which lets you throw punches by making certain movements with the analog stick, has been improved. There are also many ways to customize the appearance of your character, up to the shaping of the cranium and ears. The soundtrack consists of a dozen contemporary (but unfortunately edited) hip-hop tracks.</plot>

    <plot>In Fire! the player mans an advanced helicopter and tries to solve some of humanity's problems by shooting at them. The game consists of five thematically unrelated levels which consist of two stages each, e.g. in one mission the player has to destroy drug plants in South America and another one requires to deal with terrorists at sea. [CR]Regarding gameplay, this is a traditional, horizontally scrolling shooter: the player moves from left to right while shooting everything which moves. Shields and fuel are limited and if one reaches zero, the one and only life is lost. However, they can be refilled with power ups which are left behind from killed enemies. The standard gun can be either aimed straight or slightly downwards, but by picking up the correct power ups the weapon system can be upgraded.</plot>

Once known as Pillage, this colourful turn based shooter was stuck in development for a number of years before being picked up by Crave for a US release, followed shortly by JoWood for a European release. It plays a lot like the Worms 3D games and has a story penned by Paul Rose. The game features a geo-mod system in which almost anything can be destroyed, leaving battlefields scarred by craters.</plot>

    <plot>The Wii game GT Pro Series or GT Cube as the Japanese-only GameCube release, is a cel-shaded racing game that is a soft-simulation of real-world racing. The game allows you access to over 80 tunable vehicles from ten different Japanese manufacturers. Many of these cars are locked and must be obtained by playing through the game. In addition, there are several modes of play to use them on, which are Championship, Quick Race, Time Attack, Versus, and Drift-Combo.[CR]A fairly standard staple in the racing genre, the Championship is a rather straight forward career mode. In this mode, you have four classes ranging from Beginner to Professional. Beginner is free to get in, but the next three classes require you to finish the previous class and then acquire a license by passing a series of driving tests. Certain races in each class have limits on what cars can be entered, forcing you to mix things up a bit and develop different strategies.[CR]Quick Race is good if you just want to jump into the game and start. You can use any parts, cars and tracks you've unlocked so far from the Championship mode.[CR]Time Attack is a time trial mode where the object is to get the best time you can with the car and track you choose.[CR]Versus is the game's multiplayer mode. Two to four players can battle it out with any unlocked cars and tracks.[CR]Drift-Combo is a challenging mode that scores you based one how well you can drift on a selection of three drift courses. Connecting drifts raises your score and subsequently, your ranking on the board.[CR]The Wii version is bundled with a steering wheel.</plot>

    <plot>Sometime in the 1980s, the Japanese Choro-Q Racing toys made their way to U.S. shores. Renamed Penny Racers for the benefit of American sales, the wind-up cars were built to perform different tricks (wheelies and spins, mostly) when a penny was inserted into their chassis. The plastic racers are still very popular in Japan, inspiring a video game called CHORO-Q ADVANCE. The U.S. release of the game is called GADGET RACERS, and it's every bit as exciting as the toys that it's based on. Command any of 50 unique vehicles through 40 different courses of obstacles, tricks, and general mayhem. You can customize your racer to meet your specifications, using more than 130 different parts to soup things up upgrade your tires, brakes, steering, engines, and more. Adding to the excitement is the fact that you can get four players competing for glory via a link cable and for Game Boy Advance consoles. It's a mystery why the toys no longer roam the bedroom floors of American households, but maybe this awesome video game will create a resurgence.</plot>

    <plot>The threat of demonic invasion gives impetus to the fledgling Simba Empire to found a school of magic called Vara Noir. With the world recovering after a devastating war, the Empire uses the school to train students in the ways of battle and magic to prepare for any imminent and far-off threats. Enter 13-year old chimney sweeper Myu who cleans smokestacks and other debris laden orifices. One day, her grandpappy hands her a mighty sword and a few ducats and commands her to apply to Vara Noir for an education in the mystic arts. Myu takes the entrance examination and passes with flying colors. As such, she enters Vara Noir academy and goes on an adventure where she will eventually help save the kingdom.[CR]Idea Factory's latest game in the Kingdom of Chaos series features dungeon exploration, character interaction and an Megami-Tensei-esque item synthesis system where special items found in dungeons may be bonded with weapons to increase attack power, imbue properties, etc. Interaction sequences are of the point 'n click sort where questions and answers are rattled off in routine fashion.[CR]Originally released on the PS2, Gakuen Toshi Vara Noir joins the Gamecube library with new animation sequences and graphical updates which freshen up the adventure for old and new gamers to enjoy.</plot>

    <plot>Gauntlet: Dark Legacy is the follow-up to Gauntlet: Legends and another installment in the long-running Gauntlet series of hack-and-slash action games. As with all the Gauntlet games, you play a medieval fantasy character who, along with allies if you have them, fights his or her way through hordes of evil creatures on the never ending quest for more gold and perhaps even an eventual goal. [CR]This version contains the characters and levels from Gauntlet: Legends, plus the new characters and levels from the Dark Legacy arcade game, with a few extra levels thrown in.[CR]There are eight characters to initially choose from: the mighty Warrior, the deadly Valkyrie, the quick-footed Archer, the powerful Wizard, the spellcasting Sorceress, the stalwart Knight, the valiant Dwarf, and the chaotic Jester. Although there are similarities between characters from the two games, each character looks and plays differently. In addition, there are eight alternative-modes for these characters to unlock, plus dozens of secret characters to obtain. With a multi-tap, up to four players can play, with rules governing how much they can hurt each other. Unlike the original Gauntlets, the levels you'll face take place in various terrain from forests to mountains to volcanic plains. Many of the monsters are familiar to old fans of the series, but there are some new blood among the ranks of evil, including some rather large foes.</plot>

    <plot>In this Harry Potter game, join him during his second term at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. A dark plot against his "Mudblood" classmates has Harry befuddled as more and more students are strangely petrified. Harry must learn new spells and cast them without mistake to uncover the secrets and solve the mysteries. Interact with familiar characters from the movie: Ron, Hermoine and, of course, Gilderoy Lockhart. Additionally, there are multiple mini-games and side quests.</plot>

    <plot>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is a 2005 video game based on the film Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. The movie is based on J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, the fourth novel in the Harry Potter series.[CR]The game follows the three main characters of the film -- namely Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, and Ron Weasley -- and there is an entirely new spell-casting system that allows for collaborative spells. The characters themselves more closely resemble their film counterparts than in previous games. It also has higher-quality graphics than the previous Harry Potter video games. However, the game play in the fourth video game is much more action-oriented, which is a change from the previous games.[CR]In addition, players can play the game with friends, and can combine their magic and spells to make them more powerful. Players can also capture moving beans using Accio and increase their power with collectors, creature, and character, cards.[CR]There is no RPG iteration of the game, unlike with previous titles. In addition, it was pointed out that unlike the previous installments, there was not much room to "run around" such as in the previous games where you were allowed to move freely within the castle and on the grounds.[CR]The game is divided into several non-consecutive levels, some of which are locked at the beginning of the game until the player collects enough Triwizard Shields to unlock it.[CR]It is noted as the last Harry Potter game released on GameCube and Xbox, it is also the first Harry Potter Game to get an E10+ Rating in North America.</plot>

    <plot>Two years after versions on other platforms, the then-current consoles got their own adaptation of the first Harry Potter book and film. Like in the computer and PlayStation versions, Harry Potter's first year at school of magic Hogwarts is presented as a 3D action adventure title.[CR]After a tutorial at Ollivander's Wand Shop and an introductory first night at Hogwarts, the game is organized into distinct days and nights. Days mostly consist of lessons, where usually Harry will learn new spells. The more interesting stuff happens at night, of course, when Harry sneaks around the castle to do things like meeting Draco Malfoy for a duel, fighting a troll in the dungeons, and other important scenes from the film and book.[CR]Most tasks involve platform sections, where Harry has to jump over chasms and balance along edges. Often, creatures will be in the way that have to be fought using the correct spells, and magic must also be used to solve the occasional puzzle. At night, Harry must watch out for prefects patrolling the floors of the castle to avoid getting sent back to the common room. There's also broomstick flying in the game, including a Quidditch match against Slytherin.[CR]After classes, Hogwarts can be freely explored. At any time, it is possible to revisit school lessons to get better grades, often only possible after some more advanced spells have been learned. Also, lots of collectibles can be found both in the open and hidden areas: collecting 20 wizard cards increases Harry's health and Every Flavour Beans can be traded in Fred and George's shop for more cards and some other useful items.</plot>

    <plot>Y is a game based on the divide and conquer principle. Each level starts as a blue area surrounded with a thin green border. The player is represented by a small white ball, and when it moves into the blue area, it trails a purple "tail." Once the ball moves back into the green, any empty blue area cut off by the tail becomes green as well. If the area is not empty, only the tail itself turns green. [CR]There are red balls moving in the blue area, and black balls moving around the green area. The player starts with three lives, and has 3 minutes to turn 75% of the blue area to green. The player loses a life when the white ball touches a green or red ball, when a red ball touches the purple tail, or when the clock runs out. The player gains a life by finishing a level without losing any lives, or by getting an "extra life" power up.[CR]Power ups appear randomly in the blue area for a short amount of time, and include:[CR]Extra Life[CR]Extra Time - add 20 seconds to the clock[CR]Skip Level - immediately warp to the next level[CR]Bridge - immediately turn the purple tail to green[CR]Destroy - any red balls touching the player's ball or the purple tail within the next 5 seconds will be destroyed[CR]Freeze - freezes all red and black balls for 5 seconds[CR]Speed - increases the speed of the player's ball for 5 seconds[CR]Level one contains 1 black ball and 1 red ball. A new red ball is added every level, but the number resets to 1 every 10 levels, though the ball starts moving faster. A new black ball is added every 20 levels.</plot>

Stalk and eliminate your targets up close and personal, in either first- or third-person perspectives. You must decide whether to use stealth or aggression, but be careful--you'll have to deal with the consequences.[CR]In the game, players assume the role of an assassin known as Agent 47. The game advances as players carry out contract killings by solving puzzles to arrange for stealthy, untraceable assassinations.</plot>

    <plot>Home Run King is an MLB-licensed baseball game released exclusively for the GameCube. Designed more as a pick-up-and-play game than a detailed simulation, it offers fast-paced gameplay and a basic selection of modes.[CR]Modes include Exhibition, Season, Playoffs and Home Run Derby. The game features team customization and player creation and trading. Players will control all aspects of play: pitching, batting, fielding and running.[CR]The pitching interface features a pitch type selector that displays the pitches available to the current player as lines whose length indicates their effectiveness. Pitches are selected by moving the control stick in the appropriate direction, and then pressing the appropriate button for normal, slow or fast pitches or pick-off throws. A timing gauge must be stopped at the maximum point for best results.[CR]The batting interface reuses the pitch type selector, this time for predicting the pitch that is thrown. A batting cursor must be moved to meet the incoming ball to hit it. If the correct pitch was predicted, the cursor is larger and makes hitting easier. Bunts as well as normal, power and contact swings are possible.[CR]During fielding, an icon indicates the ball's height and position, and the A button can be pressed to make a super play: diving or sliding after the ball. Before the pitch is made, runners can be made to increase their lead for an attempted steal. Running is otherwise automatic, with only the destination base selectable.</plot>

    <plot>Disc is a game of fast reflexes and clever thinking. [CR]Control one player against the computer or another person. The objective is to finish off opponents by knocking him off the platforms or by making the platform disappear by hitting the walls behind your opponents. Your weapon is a disc, which you can throw at your opponent or at the walls. The disc will ricochet off the walls, opening a wide range of angles and attacks. You can also try a direct hit at your opponents, as enough of these will eliminate him as well, but be careful - since it gives him a chance to block your disc, thus gain control of it![CR]As you progress through the levels, from Novice, through Disciple, up to a Great Guide, your rivals become tougher, platforms take longer hits to disappear, and there are more discs on the playing field.</plot>

    <plot>Six tough events await in this joystick-waggling successor to Track &amp;Field.;[CR]The full sequence of events is - swimming, skeet shooting, gymnastics, archery, triple jumping and weightlifting. You must complete each event in order to be allowed onto the next one.[CR]Swimming involves moving left and right as fast as possible, while pressing fire when a breath is required. Skeet shooting and archery both come down to timing - though elevation and wind factors affect the latter. Gymnastics involves timing a succession of presses to ensure that the jump is long and the landing graceful. The triple jump involves one press for each part of the jump, whereas the weightlifting involves merely brute strength.[CR]If the player wants to go to the next event or round, they will have to qualify by beating increasingly difficult maximum times or minimum targets.</plot>

    <plot>I-Ninja is a 3D platform title starring an original character created by British developer Argonaut Software. Players control a spirited young ninja as they make their way through a diverse selection of indoor and outdoor locales. The title character is garbed in a blue suit and matching hooded mask, so that only his eyes and his expressive brow are visible to players. The character also wields a pair of katana blades in both hands as he jumps from platform to platform, avoiding hazards and slicing at enemies. The cartoon-style atmosphere is brought to life with the use of cel-shaded graphics, giving the game a distinctive look from many of its platform contemporaries.[CR]I-Ninja is an adrenaline-charged adventure game. An ultra-cool ninja with major attitude meets extreme sports game play, I-Ninja is the consummate warrior who has spent years mastering his weapons and honing his skills. In true gravity defying game play, I-Ninja can scale buildings, "shred" on extreme rails, hover great distances with a "sword copter", ride drifting roller spheres and utilize specialized manga-style ninja moves to navigate through each dynamic environment.</plot>

    <plot>Several years ago in the small island nation of Horai, the leader of the nation, Tenro Horai, discovered the Ubusunagami Okinokai--the Power of the Gods. This energy emanated from an object she dug up from deep underground and granted her unimaginable powers. Soon after, Tenro and her followers, who called themselves "The Divine Ones", began conquering nations one after another. "The Chosen People" carried out these conquests in "the name of peace".[CR]Meanwhile, a freedom federation called Tenkaku emerged to challenge Horai. Using fighter planes called Hitekkai, they fought with the hope of freeing the world from the grips of the Horai - but all their efforts were in vain. They were no match for the Horai and were eventually almost completely wiped out. Miraculously, however, one young man survived. His name was Shinra (Sen Luo ?).[CR]Shot down near a remote village called Ikaruga, inhabited by elderly people who had been exiled by the Horai's conquests, Shinra was dragged from the wreckage and nursed back to health. Shinra regained his health and pledged to defeat the Horai, and the villagers entrusted him with a fighter plane that they had built themselves, called the Ikaruga.[CR]The Ikaruga was no ordinary plane, designed by former engineering genius Amanai (Tian Nei ?) with the help of Kazamori (Feng Shou ?) and the village leaders. Hidden in a secret underground bunker and launched via the transportation device called the "Sword of Acala", it is the first fighter built that integrates both energy polarities, and is capable of successfully switching between the two.</plot>

    <plot>Several years ago in the small island nation of Horai, the leader of the nation, Tenro Horai, discovered the Ubusunagami Okinokai--the Power of the Gods. This energy emanated from an object she dug up from deep underground and granted her unimaginable powers. Soon after, Tenro and her followers, who called themselves "The Divine Ones", began conquering nations one after another. "The Chosen People" carried out these conquests in "the name of peace".[CR]Meanwhile, a freedom federation called Tenkaku emerged to challenge Horai. Using fighter planes called Hitekkai, they fought with the hope of freeing the world from the grips of the Horai - but all their efforts were in vain. They were no match for the Horai and were eventually almost completely wiped out. Miraculously, however, one young man survived. His name was Shinra (Sen Luo ?).[CR]Shot down near a remote village called Ikaruga, inhabited by elderly people who had been exiled by the Horai's conquests, Shinra was dragged from the wreckage and nursed back to health. Shinra regained his health and pledged to defeat the Horai, and the villagers entrusted him with a fighter plane that they had built themselves, called the Ikaruga.[CR]The Ikaruga was no ordinary plane, designed by former engineering genius Amanai (Tian Nei ?) with the help of Kazamori (Feng Shou ?) and the village leaders. Hidden in a secret underground bunker and launched via the transportation device called the "Sword of Acala", it is the first fighter built that integrates both energy polarities, and is capable of successfully switching between the two.</plot>

    <plot>Disc is a game of fast reflexes and clever thinking. [CR]Control one player against the computer or another person. The objective is to finish off opponents by knocking him off the platforms or by making the platform disappear by hitting the walls behind your opponents. Your weapon is a disc, which you can throw at your opponent or at the walls. The disc will ricochet off the walls, opening a wide range of angles and attacks. You can also try a direct hit at your opponents, as enough of these will eliminate him as well, but be careful - since it gives him a chance to block your disc, thus gain control of it![CR]As you progress through the levels, from Novice, through Disciple, up to a Great Guide, your rivals become tougher, platforms take longer hits to disappear, and there are more discs on the playing field.</plot>

    <plot>July is a mystery adventure game that follows the story of two young men, Makoto Tanimura (19-year old) and Joshua (29-year old) who set on a quest to uncover the mystery behind a bombing that took place several years ago. The story of the two play separately in their own chapters and can be progressed in any order, one chapter at the time. While their stories start separately, their paths cross when they uncover the truth behind the bombing and how it all ties to a secret corporation known as NAX.[CR]July is more of a visual novel where player advances through dialogues and choices, and travels to different locations, than typical adventure with clickable objects and inventory items. The map is a big part of interface and chooses many locations that player can visit as events are triggered by visiting the right place at the right time. The game uses anime style character art with pre-rendered backgrounds and occasional pre-rendered animated cut-scenes. There is no voice-acting, however, neither for player characters nor for NPCs.</plot>

Versus mode allows competition between two players; in a friendly game, the computer AI chooses an opponent for the team selected by the player; the "Open" mode is a tournament in which players can assign controllable teams to themselves and to the AI. The game itself can be set on "Action", "Simulation", or "Auto" mode, with varying degrees of realism. Pitchers and batters are controlled from a third-person view, while baserunning is viewed from an overhead perspective.</plot>

    <plot>Kero Kero King if sports game that is a sort of a golf game but using a frog instead of a ball. The Kero Kero King is the champion of that Kero sports. The game is about guiding the frog named Kero across obstacle-laden courses by gauging wind velocity, tweaking direction and adjusting height and jump. Although it's not exactly golf, many principles from that sport of choice are found in this game.[CR]The 'Kero Kero' of the title comes from the onomatopoeia for the sound a frog makes. But no wonder the frog is squawking as it gets hammered around the course in a game of croquet with frogs instead of balls.[CR]Various conditions to consider too like in golf such as the wind direction or the fact that the ball is a frog and will jump off spiders webs or launch at passing flies. Allows players to enjoy their own characters in versus mode too.[CR]You can buy items off of the players you beat like their frogs, hammers, and clothes. There are 10 courses and 3 opponents per level, and 10 rounds per opponent, the one with the highest score at the end wins. Once you beat all 3 oppenents on the level you move to a new level to face 3 more with 10 new courses.[CR]You can buy frog power boosters and antidotes, but you can only have 4 items per opponent, so if your frog gets posioned you can cure him without missing a turn or give him a quick power boost for a long shot.[CR]The game got a sequel in the Playstation 2 console (called Kero Kero King Super DX or Ribbit King in Europe and in the United States), and other games of this serie were released for the Nintendo DS or Gamecube consoles (Kero Kero King DX).</plot>

    <plot>Disc is a game of fast reflexes and clever thinking. [CR]Control one player against the computer or another person. The objective is to finish off opponents by knocking him off the platforms or by making the platform disappear by hitting the walls behind your opponents. Your weapon is a disc, which you can throw at your opponent or at the walls. The disc will ricochet off the walls, opening a wide range of angles and attacks. You can also try a direct hit at your opponents, as enough of these will eliminate him as well, but be careful - since it gives him a chance to block your disc, thus gain control of it![CR]As you progress through the levels, from Novice, through Disciple, up to a Great Guide, your rivals become tougher, platforms take longer hits to disappear, and there are more discs on the playing field.</plot>

The game also features alternative music (including vocals) from artists Razed in Black, Los Infernos, Suicide Machines, and Pigs in Space.</plot>

    <year>2002</year>
    <plot>Knockout Kings is a series of boxing video games that were produced by EA Sports for the PlayStation, Nintendo 64, PlayStation 2, Xbox, Game Boy Color and GameCube yearly between 1998 and 2003.[CR]Before releasing the first Knockout Kings, Electronic Arts released its first 3D boxing game, Foes of Ali, for the 3DO in 1995. While there are a few similarities between the two games, Foes of Ali was developed by a different team, Gray Matter and as such, is not regarded as a true prequel.[CR]The Knockout Kings game series gives the user a chance to compete against numerous real fighters, such as Muhammad Ali, Eric Esch, Marvin Hagler, Sugar Ray Leonard, Oscar De La Hoya, Larry Holmes, Jake LaMotta, Roberto Duran, Alexis Arguello, and Ray Mancini. The duration of a round can be adjusted to either 90 seconds or 3 minutes. In the game's "slugfest" mode, fighters can knock each other out at any given moment of the fight, or suffer 6 or 7 knockdowns and still last for the whole fight. There are several differences between Knockout Kings, Knockout Kings 2000, and Knockout Kings 2001 in particular, the most notable being the graphics.[CR]In Knockout Kings, the boxer sprites, although distinctive, are not facially representative of their real-life counterparts. Championship bouts can last only up to 10 rounds and not for 12 as in real life or 15 as in the past. In between rounds, all that is seen is a ring-card girl. In Career Mode, a fighter is made to retire right after winning the title and defending it for only the first time. A created boxer can fight in Career Mode and Slugfest Mode, but not in Exhibition mode. Although there is a training mode within Career Mode, it is extremely basic. However, 2 aspects that Knockout Kings has which the sequels lack is that the referee does a mandatory eight-count when a fighter is knocked down whereas in the sequels the referee stops the count immediately after a fighter gets up from a knockdown, and, in Career Mode, the result of a fight is afterwards seen on the screen as front-page newspaper headlines.[CR]In Knockout Kings 2000 for the PS1, the boxer sprites are for the first time facially representative of their real-life counterparts. Championship bouts can last up to 15 rounds. Sound and Music volume can also be adjusted in Option Mode. In between rounds, you may see either a ring-card girl, a replay of a part of the previous round, or your boxer sitting at his corner together with the statistics so far of the bout. Injury to the face of boxers can also be recognized, as well as his mouth-piece flying out if he is hit by a hard punch. A created boxer in Career Mode can now fight in all Modes. The training mode within Career Mode is more specific. You can now control your boxer while he is training and, in the PS1 version, you can also choose the location of your gym. Each boxer in the PS1 version can also be seen entering into the ring just before the bout takes place. There is also a new Mode where the player can see the statistics and biography of all the real-life boxers in the game, and another Mode in which the player can re-live famous classic bouts. The user-interface and intro-theme of the PS1 version is different to the N64 version and there are also more boxers, while the graphics on each version are similar.[CR]Knockout Kings 2001 contains the same improvements as Knockout Kings 2000 and adds more. Whereas fighters in KO Kings and KO Kings 2000 are either "boxer" or "slugger" style fighters, the styles of fighters in KO Kings 2001 are either "boxer", "slugger", "freestyle", or "crab", and these differences of style are very noticeable during bouts. Commentary in KO Kings 2001 is also far more vocal than its predecessors. During Career Mode, your trainer will occasionally talk and give you advice in between rounds as you progress through the bout. A fighter in Career Mode is made to retire after winning the title and defending it for several times. KO Kings 2001 is also the first game of the series to introduce CPU vs CPU bouts and "fantasy match-ups" between famous boxers of different eras, and the first to introduce women's boxing, which is accessible in Exhibition Mode. The PS1 and PS2 versions of Knockout Kings 2001 are virtually identical.[CR]Knockout Kings 2002 changes many concepts of its predecessors, e.g. you have to progress through a number of bouts in order to unlock new fighters.[CR]After Knockout Kings 2003, the name of the series was replaced by Fight Night (EA video game series).</plot>

    <plot>Doshin is all about playing God. Players star in the role of a yellow giant who, like the sun, ascends every morning from the sea to visit the peaceful inhabitants of a chain of tropical islands -- and much like the sun, the giant can bring both life and death. Your basic actions are walking, picking up objects or people, raising the terrain by pulling it up or lowering it by jumping on it. As you explore your surroundings, you encounter different tribes of island natives that go about their daily lives. The ultimate goal of the game is to help the different tribes flourish and get them to construct temples and henges to honor your giant. Each time a tribe builds such a structure, it is added to your monument journal. Released only on 64DD (with an even more obscure add-on disk released later), the game was remade for GameCube.</plot>

    <plot>LEGO Star Wars: The Video Game allows players to relive the events of the Star Wars prequel movie trilogy (Episodes I, II and III) in LEGO form. Players take control of over thirty characters to play through key moments from The Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith. The storyline includes most of the important events in the movies, omitting or adding a few sequences. The presentation of these events, however, is humorous, with all the characters and environments made out of LEGO bricks. Objects would often break apart like physical LEGO bricks, characters have comical expressions, and all dialogue from corresponding events from the movies is replaced by gestures.</plot>

    <plot>LEGO Star Wars: The Video Game allows players to relive the events of the Star Wars prequel movie trilogy (Episodes I, II and III) in LEGO form. Players take control of over thirty characters to play through key moments from The Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith. The storyline includes most of the important events in the movies, omitting or adding a few sequences. The presentation of these events, however, is humorous, with all the characters and environments made out of LEGO bricks. Objects would often break apart like physical LEGO bricks, characters have comical expressions, and all dialogue from corresponding events from the movies is replaced by gestures.</plot>

    <plot>Legend is the seventh major game in the Tomb Raider series, now for the first time developed by Crystal Dynamics, along with the original character designer of the game's protagonist Lara Croft- Toby Gard. Heroine Lara is searching for a South American relic, but her adventure takes a different course when rogue anthropologist Amanda Evert shows up. Presumed dead along with a team of graduate students after an accident in a tomb in Peru, where Lara was the only one to escape, Amanda is back with a score to settle as they both race, along with the shady James Rutland Jr., to obtain an ancient artifact. Many other characters, both friends and foes, will stir things up. The story takes Lara through locations all over the world, from the Himalayas to Ghana, Kazakhstan, Bolivia, Japan and England, including her famous mansion filled with secrets and collectibles. Aside from current events, Lara's past is also revealed, through flashbacks. Among other things, you will get to know how she lost her mother and why it is such a burden. The typical third-person action-adventuring exploring is still present. Lara can move more freely, and is no longer limited by specific jumps. As you travel through rough environments, you will need to run, dive, swim, climb on poles, ladders, roofs, use zip lines, shimmy and vault, with acrobatic actions such as somersaults and flips. You need to cross difficult terrain, solve puzzles to advance or open up new areas, and engage in combat. New tools include a grappling hook, not only used to move around but also to haul enemies Scorpion-style, binoculars, a PLS (personal light source), flares, a PDA and a headset to keep in contact with tech support Zip. Enemies are still rather scarce. Both humans and animals will attack you, and the game retains the auto lock-on mode, but now with a slide attack and close combat with both kicks and punches, plus bullet-time actions to get behind enemies quickly. Lara carries her trademark dual-wielded pistols, but can also pick up new weapons along the way, such as a shotgun and grenades. Missions take place in both indoor and outdoor environments, with arcade motorcycle and jeep sequences in between. As usual, Lara has a fancy outfit for each location. The PSP version includes the full game and adds a multiplayer mode- Tomb Trials. You can race another player through tombs to see who comes out first, or go on a timed scavenger hunt for artifacts.</plot>

When his adoptive father dies, the now 26-year-old Largo inherits the Winch Corporation, a financial consortium worth more than 10 billion dollars. Drawn to the challenge of presiding over such a vast empire, Largo takes over from his father, and plunges headfirst into a new, unexpectedly vicious world of murder and deceit.</plot>

    <plot>The game begins with the land of Hyrule in a state of fear because of strange happenings that have occurred recently. On a stormy night, Princess Zelda and the shrine maidens fear that the reason for these events is that Vaati's seal is weakening. She summons Link and brings him to the castle so he can protect her and the other maidens while they open the portal to the Four Sword Sanctuary. When they do, however, a shadowy figure appears from the portal. This figure was Shadow Link, who then kidnapped the shrine maidens and sealed them in crystals. Link follows him to the sanctuary where he retrieves the Four Sword to destroy this doppelganger. The Four Sword is a magical sword that splits the wielder into three clones of himself. Vaati is once again released and wreaks havoc on the once peaceful kingdom.</plot>

    <plot>The game is set on a group of islands in a vast sea--a first for the series. The player controls Link, the protagonist of the Zelda series. He struggles against his nemesis, Ganondorf, for control of a sacred relic known as the Triforce. Link spends a large portion of the game sailing, traveling between islands, and traversing through dungeons and temples to gain the power necessary to defeat Ganondorf. He also spends time trying to find his little sister.[CR]The Wind Waker follows in the footsteps of Ocarina of Time and its sequel Majora's Mask, retaining the basic gameplay and control system from the two Nintendo 64 titles. A heavy emphasis is placed on using and controlling wind with a baton called the Wind Waker, which aids sailing and floating in air. Controversial during development for its use of cel shading graphics and younger Link character, The Wind Waker received acclaim on release and is one of the Nintendo GameCube's most popular games.</plot>

He struggles against his nemesis, Ganondorf, for control of a sacred relic known as the Triforce. Link spends a large portion of the game sailing, traveling between islands, and traversing through dungeons and temples to gain the power necessary to defeat Ganondorf. He also spends time trying to find his little sister.[CR]The Wind Waker follows in the footsteps of Ocarina of Time and its sequel Majora's Mask, retaining the basic gameplay and control system from the two Nintendo 64 titles. A heavy emphasis is placed on using and controlling wind with a baton called the Wind Waker, which aids sailing and floating in air. Controversial during development for its use of cel shading graphics and younger Link character, The Wind Waker received acclaim on release and is one of the Nintendo GameCube's most popular games.</plot>

Players take the roles of Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire, solving puzzles, fighting villains and finding objects. Players encounter characters such as Mr. Poe, Uncle Monty and Aunt Josephine, along with villains such as Count Olaf, the hook-handed man, the white-faced women, and the bald man with the long nose.[CR]A significant feature has Emily Browning, Liam Aiken and Jim Carrey reprising their roles from the film while the voice of Lemony Snicket is provided by Tim Curry, who provided narration for the audiobooks for the series.</plot>

    <plot>The Lord of the Rings is a 2003 pinball game designed by George Gomez and distributed by Stern Pinball. It is based on the The Lord of the Rings (film series), which was first released in 2001. It features the highest possible score multiplier in pinball to date: During a combined "Two Towers" and "Gollum" Multiball it is possible to achieve a 84x Jackpot (when scoring seven subsequent combo Jackpot shots, having the 2x scoring Elf gift and the Smeagol phase of Gollum Multiball running at once). This game was re-released in December 2009 as The Lord of the Rings: Limited Edition, which adds a shaker motor and updated software.</plot>

    <plot>Midway's first extreme sports title that tackles the great American past-time... baseball. Take control of all of your favorite Major League Baseball teams and players armed with all of their real stats, attributes, abilities and attitude. Slugfest features many playable minigames, a season mode, quick play and exhibition play.[CR]So what makes MLB Slugfest extreme? The game is far from a real baseball simulation. This is as arcade as it gets. Flaming fastballs that take out batters ankles (and reducing their stats), out-of-the-park home runs, dropkicking the catcher on your dash to home plate, kidney punching the batter who just ruined your no-hitter and many other brutal tactics bring sportsmanship to an all-new low.[CR]Graphic touches include real player faces and details such as chewing gum and talking to teammates or opponents. Real stadiums all make their appearances along with several fantasy stadiums that can be unlocked.</plot>

    <plot>The second title in Midway's baseball series, SlugFest 20-04 continues to pour on the rough-housing gameplay, bizarre codes, and humorous commentary. In addition to the new Home Run Derby mode and Create-A-Team options, the game features the ability of pitchers to catch "On Fire" and impossible Special Pitches that zigzag, arc, and whizz by in ways that would leave any batter humiliated. New secret teams have been added to the previous bunch, including aliens, minotaurs, and Sub-Zero of Mortal Kombat fame. The customizable Instant Replay is another nice touch, allowing you to relive the awkward moments once you pause the game. And, of course, Tim Kitzrow and Jim Shorts return to the commentators' booth, making their signature random comments and incessant arguments.</plot>

    <plot>2006's edition in the unstoppable football series with a brand new passing game in the Quarterback Vision Control system.[CR]Although thousands of them already line up each August to catch the latest edition of gaming's most recognized annual title, it's safe to say that football fans and sports gamers will have an even harder time passing on the "06" version of Madden NFL. This edition of the long-running series introduces a few changes and additions, designed to make the challenges of executing on offense feel more realistic than ever before.[CR]The most obvious changes to this year's edition come in the passing game, which introduces gameplay features based on quarterback-specific attributes. Most notable is the new "Vision Cone," which simulates the QB's field of view with a highlighted cone that fans out in the direction of the current intended receiver.[CR]The feature is designed to force the player on offense to commit earlier in the play, and to telegraph his passes much more realistically than in earlier versions of Madden, making those improbably easy "no-look" completions a thing of the past. The range of the vision cone is based on multiple factors, including the quarterback's "talent" attribute rating and the difficulty settings at which the game is being played.[CR]Madden NFL 06 also brings a new "Precision Passing" system to the series, which allows quarterbacks some direct control over the accuracy of their passes. By bumping the left analog stick or D-pad in the desired direction as the ball is passed, QBs can aim high, low, in front, or behind their receivers, allowing them to lead the catcher away from coverage or make use of height advantages.[CR]Other features, more familiar to gaming's most popular sports series, are also present in Madden 06, along with new replay camera angles, animations, and other presentational upgrades. There's also an offensive answer to last year's defensive "hit stick" mechanic, which allows ball carriers to try to plow through oncoming hits and blocks with a flick of commitment on the analog stick.[CR]As usual, this edition of Madden is designed to offer a highly customizable game of football, and players who prefer the more forgiving play design of earlier editions can simply turn off the Vision Cone -- or nearly any other element that conflicts with their personal style of play. The game also includes all the teams, stadiums, and players of the real-life NFL (thanks to an exclusive license that takes effect for the first time this year).</plot>

    <plot>Madden NFL 07 is the seventeenth installment of the Madden NFL series. This version introduces some new tricks, updates some features, and brings depth to some game modes from previous Madden titles.[CR]The 07 game focuses on the Running Back by giving you lead blocker controls. After selecting a running play, you can cycle through offensive players to open up gaps. New evasive maneuvers are controlled with a separate stick to elude defenders, along with new juking and spinning maneuvers.[CR]Start a career with your favorite NFL team, draft the players, call the plays, and lead your team to a dynasty. Or, make your own player and guide him on and off the field through his entire career starting with the draft. If you do not want to mess with all the options and features you can simply sit down for a quick game.</plot>

    <plot>Mario Power Tennis features variations of tennis matches consisting of characters, courts, and scenarios based on the Mario series. The range of courts includes the standard three types of tennis court, but consists predominantly of those themed upon games in the Mario series, known as "Gimmick" courts. As well as adopting the style aesthetically, these feature thematic elements that influence how the match will be played on that surface, such as the ghosts in the Luigi's Mansion court, which hinder movement when the character comes into physical contact with them.[CR]Although standard tennis is available, variants of the sport can be played which adopt different rules and methods of victory. "Ring Shot" involves the player earning points by hitting the ball through rings of varying sizes, with the number of points dependent on the difficulty of the shot.[9] The player acquires the points whenever a winning shot is made adhering to standard rules; the match is won once the predetermined number of points is equaled or surpassed. A similar mode, "Item Battle", involves the characters using items based on the Mario universe to interfere with each other's game and gain an advantage</plot>

    <plot>Volume is a stealth game presented as a modern take on the legend of Robin Hood as the protagonist is also called Robert Locksley and it is also about someone who steals from the rich, but in a digital age. He is a thief who finds a device called Volume that is a military training simulator, but allows users to simulate heists in virtual worlds as well. The game opens showing how Locksley is discovered and captured. It then rewinds three hours and 100 missions explain what happened before. Locksley broadcasts his simulated heists over the internet for anyone to match and finds an antagonist in Guy Gisborne, CEO of Gisborne Industries, who has also taken over the country of England. More of the story and the background is revealed through notes found during missions. Volume also has artificial intelligence called Alan who guides Locksley through the mechanics and has conversations about events while the missions are in progress.[CR]The game is played from an elevated, almost top-down perspective and consists of short, maze-like levels. To complete a level Locksley needs to collect all gems and then the exit opens up. Levels are guarded by characters called Pawns. They are stationary or patrol and it is possible to see their line of sight through a cone. When they discover Locksley they go after him and shoot. The level then has to be restarted unless a checkpoint has been activated first. There are no means to kill opponents, so strategy is always about distractions and staying unnoticed. Locksley can cling to walls, with slower movement, but at the same time ducking slightly to stay out of sight when near lower objects. The game moves to a completely top-down perspective at that time and it is possible to hop between walls around corners. He can also move in any direction while walking regularly.[CR]The initial approach to distract guards is by whistling, but eventually many types of gadgets are introduced. Gadgets can only be used when they are present in levels. The first one introduced is the Bugle that can be fired in any direction. When it is set off, also in flight, it makes a sound that draws attention. The Oddity has similar mechanics, but can only be shot at a high wall, where it will attract the attention of a guard for some time when it is spotted. Mute gives a temporary speed boost and mutes the sound of pressure plates. Gadgets generally take some time to recharge, but can be used without limits. During levels only one gadget can be carried at a time. Locksley can also flush toilets or run water taps to create sounds, and he can hide in closets behind doors.[CR]Advanced levels include new types of opponents such as turrets, and hounds with a 180 degrees line of sight. Guards will often activate alarms alerting the others when Locksley is spotted. They will then run much faster and it can only be averted by hiding for a while or hacking the security system to disable the alarm. Some levels have pressure plates that make a sound and sometimes there are forcefields blocking the path that require some time to deactivate. Levels do not always have a single solution and can often be solved in different ways.[CR]The game includes an editor that allows users to create and share custom levels online. It is also possible to edit and remix the existing levels.</plot>

    <plot>The sets are themed around six different genres of film, and the backdrops, weapons and enemies fit these sections. There is a slapstick comedy played out in black and white (complete with greyscale background) a cartoon with lots of Road Runnering and goofy facial expressions, a Wild West romp, Sci-Fi complete with aliens, and so on. After each platform level you will have to pass through a film scene - piloting a runaway mine-cart, navigating a scrolling shoot 'em up level, or similar.</plot>

    <plot>There are four overall areas the player (as Lt. William Holt) will be sent to: France, North Africa, the Soviet Union and Belgium. Each area has a set of missions for the player to complete. While some objectives will be detailed from the start, exploration of the area will cause Holt to discover more missions. Each mission consists of five elements: a primary objective, secondary objectives, killing a German officer (Nemesis battle in the game), obtaining documents from the officer and escaping. If all are completed, a gold medallion will be given. Missing one or two will gain a silver or bronze. Most missions involve Holt fighting alongside allied NPCs and working towards a common objective, often based on historical events during WWII. However, as a member of the OSS, Holt also has secondary objectives for each level, including finding documents and eliminating important German officers, such as henchmen belonging to the antagonist Graf Von Schrader.</plot>

    <plot>Frontline is a first-person shooter where players take control of the protagonist player character in a first-person perspective where they fight through levels set during the Second World War against the Wehrmacht using historical weaponry of the era, performing a series of military operations. Briefings take place at the start of each mission, which advance the plot and introduce new characters. Each mission is structured through a number of linear levels, each with differing locations, levels of action and styles of gameplay. Initially the player character begins on the frontlines during D-Day backed up by other computer AI-controlled soldiers with an emphasis on fast action-orientated gun-based gameplay. As the story progress however, the player character is sent on a variety of other missions including a number of covert and undercover operations in locations such as military based, German-occupied towns and manors, submarines and countryside settings. The player character is tasked with objectives during levels that range from infiltration, espionage, rescue and recon. Because of the variety between missions and locations, gameplay also changes pace. While many missions involve Allied assaults on German targets others include elements of stealth and exploration. For example one selections of missions has the player detach from an allied raid to infiltrate a German U-Boat in order to get to a secret facility while another has them rendezvous and sneak into a German headquarters in disguise to rescue an operative. Many missions are performed solo yet some include an AI companion for backup. Health is determined by a health bar that can be replenished using a selection "medikits" found throughout levels with varying degrees of effect.[CR]During missions, players can earn medals by the end of each level be meeting requirements such as completions of objectives, eliminating an amount of enemies and maintaining a percentage of health throughout, all represented by a bronze, silver or gold star.</plot>

    <plot>Frontline is a first-person shooter where players take control of the protagonist player character in a first-person perspective where they fight through levels set during the Second World War against the Wehrmacht using historical weaponry of the era, performing a series of military operations. Briefings take place at the start of each mission, which advance the plot and introduce new characters. Each mission is structured through a number of linear levels, each with differing locations, levels of action and styles of gameplay. Initially the player character begins on the frontlines during D-Day backed up by other computer AI-controlled soldiers with an emphasis on fast action-orientated gun-based gameplay. As the story progress however, the player character is sent on a variety of other missions including a number of covert and undercover operations in locations such as military based, German-occupied towns and manors, submarines and countryside settings. The player character is tasked with objectives during levels that range from infiltration, espionage, rescue and recon. Because of the variety between missions and locations, gameplay also changes pace. While many missions involve Allied assaults on German targets others include elements of stealth and exploration. For example one selections of missions has the player detach from an allied raid to infiltrate a German U-Boat in order to get to a secret facility while another has them rendezvous and sneak into a German headquarters in disguise to rescue an operative.

    <plot>Mega Man X teams up with Zero in a traditional console RPG. The game was developed by the same people who did Breath of Fire: Dragon Quarter. Unlike most RPGs the storyline is very similar to the traditional side-scrolling Mega Man games. In addition, the game is shorter than most RPGs. The basic plot of the game is to save Giga City from the rioting of the Liberion Army. As the game progresses you have around 7 members. With a metal called Force Metal, your characters can upgrade various elements. The Gamecube version let's you link up to Game Boy Advance so you can use the GBA as a treasure hunter locater. The PS2 version contains a Mega Man X8 Demo.</plot>

    <plot>Mega Man X Collection contains the first six games in the Mega Man X series. Mega Man X and Mega Man X2 are based on their appearances on the SNES. Mega Man X3, also originally on the SNES, is based on its 32-bit update for the PlayStation, Sega Saturn, and PC. The remaining three games are based on their PlayStation renditions. All the games now use save files, including the first few titles that originally necessitated a password for continuation, though upon loading save data, the player is still greeted with the old, fully-functional password entry screen, complete with the correct password to access the saved game. Mega Man Battle and Chase is a game that is unlocked after completing the first three games. It is a classic series kart-racing game previously unreleased in North America. Mega Man X Collection also contains unlockable artwork and music.</plot>

    <plot>The Twin Snakes is a remake of the 1998 tactical espionage action game Metal Gear Solid.[CR]The remake has the same story and dialogues as the original (although voice-overs were re-recorded for this release). The locations in the game also remained the same, but the graphics were updated to look equal in quality to contemporary games. Gameplay was also enhanced, featuring the additions that first appeared in Metal Gear Solid 2. Snake can now roll, hang from ledges, hide in lockers, drag guards' bodies away, as well as aim and shoot from first-person view. New weapons from Metal Gear Solid 2 (such as tranquilizer gun) are also present. [CR]Another noticeable change is in the game's cutscenes. Directed by the Japanese action movie director Ryuhei Kitamura, the cutscenes have been re-worked, featuring dramatic techniques used in action movies, such as slow motion and other effects.</plot>

    <plot>Disc is a game of fast reflexes and clever thinking. [CR]Control one player against the computer or another person. The objective is to finish off opponents by knocking him off the platforms or by making the platform disappear by hitting the walls behind your opponents. Your weapon is a disc, which you can throw at your opponent or at the walls. The disc will ricochet off the walls, opening a wide range of angles and attacks. You can also try a direct hit at your opponents, as enough of these will eliminate him as well, but be careful - since it gives him a chance to block your disc, thus gain control of it![CR]As you progress through the levels, from Novice, through Disciple, up to a Great Guide, your rivals become tougher, platforms take longer hits to disappear, and there are more discs on the playing field.</plot>

    <plot>If you're bored of racing Formula 1 cars, rally cars or MotoGP bikes in their natural habitats, the Micro Machines series could be for you. It involves racing miniatures representing particular vehicle types across a particular terrain found around the house. The Sports Cars race on the desktop, 4x4s in the sandpit, Formula 1 cars on a snooker table, and so on.[CR]These levels were packed with variation. The Snooker tables has the track painted on, although this is open to deviation (as are most levels), and had you racing through the pockets and across the rim of the table. Tanks raced as well, with the chance of shooting out your opponent if they got directly in front of you. The desktop levels include binders to jump across, pencil-sharpeners to avoid, and lots of visual jokes in the open homework.</plot>

    <plot>Midway Arcade Treasures 2 is the second collection of classic arcade games published by Midway for the GameCube, PlayStation 2, and Xbox. This compilation includes 20 games that were not in the 2003 release of Midway Arcade Treasures or the 2005 release of Midway Arcade Treasures 3.[CR]The game plays similar on all three consoles, though the Xbox version has the exclusive ability to upload scores to an online scoreboard. The Xbox version, however, is not compatible with the Xbox 360. The special features on each version of the game are the same. These include game histories, developer interviews, and other documents.</plot>

    <plot>Based on the movie of the same name. You play John Anderton, the head of Pre-Crime. The game is a third person fighting/adventure game. You fight your way through Pre-crime cops and change your identity in an attempt to clear your name of pre-murder charges.[CR]The game involves both hand-to-hand combat, the use of weapons and flying a jet pack. When fighting an opponent hand-to-hand there are multiple punch and kick combinations that can be used, these have greater effect on the opponent rendering them senseless quicker. Unconscious opponents can be picked up and then either hit some more or thrown. [CR]Around the levels there are power-ups to collect such as health and cash, the health is used immediately to restore the player's character while the cash is used on the black market, accessed via the pause menu, to purchase new combat manoeuvres; permanent upgrades; temporary upgrades or weapons.</plot>

    <plot>Lion is a sequel to Wolf: you are now placed in the same simulation environment, but this time you simulate a....you guessed it, a lion.[CR]As in the original you take the role of a lion chosen from a pool of 20 different animals, with varying attributes, in existing prides or handpicked groups made by yourself. You can control a single animal or all members of a pride and you get to play in either a 20-mission mode (such as survive for a day) or a simulation mode, which allows you to do whatever you want.[CR]Unlike Wolf, which takes place in three different locales, Lion is played only on the savannas and plains of the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania (tough in four different seasons).[CR]Also includes a "Lion Safari", an interactive tour of the leonine life on the Serengeti.</plot>

    <plot>This version of the classic board game supports several graphic formats and offers some different options. From 2 to 8 players can play the game, and they can all be computer players if you wish. This allows you to just sit back and watch as the computer takes over. You can choose to play a short game with a specified time limit, or a standard game, and there is a save game feature.[CR]All actions are handled entirely by keyboard. Questions appear in the center area of the board (for buying property, for instance). Pressing the first letter of a word from the top bar takes that action (Q for Quit as an example). Player stats can be viewed on the screen.</plot>

    <plot>Oh no! Old man Nebbercracker's house is eating anything and anyone who gets near it, and Halloween is almost here! So grab your Water Blaster, gather up your courage, and get ready to explore the Monster House(tm) to find out its secrets.[CR]Monster House is an old-school shoot 'em up based on Columbia Pictures' animated movie of the same name. With the help of your touch screen controlled water gun, you explore the house room by room, fighting off waves of enemies (assorted household objects) coming from every direction. You also pick up various power-ups along the way. You can play as each of the three characters from the film - DJ, Chowder, and Jenny.[CR]Monster House is an action-adventure game developed by Artificial Mind and Movement and published by THQ. Although the game was marketed toward the same pre-teen audience as the accompanying film, its gameplay was highly reminiscent of Resident Evil 4; the game was generally higher-quality than many other games based on children's films, and it received high ratings from numerous prominent gaming magazines and websites, including Play magazine and GameZone.[CR]Monster House was met with mixed reviews. Aggregating review websites GameRankings and Metacritic gave the Game Boy Advance version 66.50% and 69/100, the GameCube version 65.13% and 60/100, the DS version 63.65% and 62/100 and the PlayStation 2 version 60.64% and 59/100.[CR]This game is heavily inspired by classics like Robotron and Smash TV.</plot>

    <plot>Mortal Kombat: Deception is a 3D fighting game developed and published by Midway on October 4, 2004 for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox. It is the sixth installment in the Mortal Kombat franchise, adding new gameplay mechanics (including a manual " Combo Breaker" system, stage-specific "death traps", and stage-specific weapons), online multiplayer, new mini-games, and a new adventure/fighting hybrid Konquest Mode that serves as the prologue to the events taking place in Mortal Kombat: Deception. The game was later released in March 1, 2005 for the GameCube and November 13, 2006 for the PlayStation Portable (under the title "Mortal Kombat: Unchained"), each with bonus characters from previous Mortal Kombat games. A bonus disc came in collector's editions of the PlayStation 2 and Xbox verions, including video biographies and a port of the original Mortal Kombat.[CR] [CR]The story of Mortal Kombat: Deception takes place right after Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance. As the deadly alliance of Quan Chi and Shang Tsung emerge victorious against Raiden's warriors, a new evil, the Dragon King and former emperor of Outworld Onaga, appears to seek the six artifacts (the Kamidogu) that grant him supreme power over all realms. The main protagonist is Shujinko, a warrior with the power to copy other fighter's abilities who was deceived into ressurecting Onaga prior to the main story.</plot>

    <plot>Kessen is a strategy game that tells the story of the events that brought feudal Japan out of a century of civil war and installed the Tokugawa Shogunate as the dominant political entity for the next two hundred years.[CR]As either Tokugawa Ieyasu or his opponents, you'll engage in real time battles, including Sekigahara, one of the largest and most famous battles in Japanese history. Victory or defeat will steer you down a campaign trail, taking you either through the historical events of the time or down fictional 'what if?' scenarios.

    <plot>Published in COMPUTE!'s Gazette 1986/04 (Issue #34), Dunk will challenge any previous conceptions you may have had about your joystick. Pressing up may move your player down, while pressing left may move you riht. And just when you think you have the pattern mastered, it changes! The gameboards consists of 3 square platforms, stack one on the other. Each platform has 4 edges, which you must avoid. Anytime a ball falls off the edge, it is lost forever. The top two platforms have holes through which a ball can fall to the next level. During the course of the game, 25 balls enter the playing field from the top of the screen. Each lands somewhere on the top platform and begins to roll towards either the left or right edge, whichever is farthest away. The object of the game is to steer the balls into the openings so they fall to the next level. When a ball reaches the bottom platform, try o knock it into one of the scoring slots on the righthand edge. A ball over the edge gives no points.</plot>

    <plot>NCAA College Basketball 2K3 is an American college basketball video game which was initially released on November 26, 2002 for the Xbox, PS2 and GameCube. It is to this day the only title in the series that uses the "College Basketball" designation rather than "College Hoops". It is also the only title for the series to appear on the GameCube and the GameCube's only college basketball game. It features former Duke Blue Devils guard Jay Williams on the cover. This game was released in very limited quantities and is one of the more difficult GameCube titles to find.</plot>

    <plot>NCAA College Football 2K3 is an American football video game released in 2002 by Visual Concepts. The cover athlete is former Nebraska Cornhuskers quarterback Eric Crouch. It is the second College Football game by Visual Concepts (the first being NCAA College Football 2K2: Road to the Rose Bowl for the Dreamcast ). The game also has ESPN style game play, meaning at half-time it gives you a report on your game and others around the league. It includes an editable roster, but you cannot name the players as, traditionally, NCAA athletes are referred to as "John Doe" and not by their full name. There are basic game modes such as the dynasty or jump into a quick play. Dynasty is where you lead your team over the course of a year to the National Championship. Legacy mode is when you completely take over a team, control its recruiting classes, and remain a "Division 1" powerhouse. The game was also the last college football video game made by Visual Concepts.</plot>

    <plot>NFL Blitz Pro is the 2003 entry in Midway's arcade football series. Like NHL Hitz Pro however, this entry moves away from its arcade roots toward more of a simulation style, while still retaining some arcade flavor in that there are no penalties or injuries and players can "catch on fire". The main changes to the predecessors are full 11-on-11 teams, standard 10 yard downs and more support for running plays.[CR]Game modes include Quick Play and Exhibition, a full Season, a 10-season Franchise and 4- or 8-player tournaments. There also is a create-a-player feature. While there are no hot routes and audibles are limited to a pre-determined set of four, the Impact Player feature allows control of one specific player who can make last-minute adjustments. Only the PlayStation 2 version includes an online mode for multiplayer games and roster updates.[CR]The game has many special features unlockable through the Blitz Shop. Credits for the shop are earned by performing feats in non-franchise games. Available for purchase are fantasy teams and stadiums, and new game modes: in Butterfingaz mode, every hit leads to a fumble, while Cyberleague features robot teams and an exploding ball. Also available is the customary Big Head mode, among several others. Old-school Blitz series arcade gameplay is available in Blitz Classic mode.</plot>

    <plot>Hit the ice with EA Sports' NHL 06 for the XBOX. This entry in the NHL series builds on the 2005 version by adding new rules and an up to date rooster that includes just about every big name in the National Hockey League. NHL 06 includes everything from NHL 05, including the revamped shooting controls. New to the 2006 version is the use of the left analog stick for deking, which in hockey terms means to dodge and fake out defenders. The right analog stick is used to pull off fancy moves like a spin or between the legs pass. These fancy moves will distract goalkeepers, giving the gamer an opening to shoot. The drawback to these moves is that only superstar characters can pull them off regularly. The game includes many of the traditional hockey game modes, including dynasty mode. In dynasty mode, gamers will control their own hockey team and have to deal with outside pressures, sponsors, and more while trying to meet the team philosophy, which is different for each team. Other modes include single season, leagues and tournaments, quick game, and online play. The graphics of NHL 06 are top notch. This time, they've been tweaked to accurately show character size differences. The defense players and goalkeepers, who are traditionally larger players, actually look larger, while the smaller and faster scorers are indeed a little thinner and smaller. This is just one small change that adds to the overall amazing gameplay of NHL 06.</plot>

    <plot>Hit the ice with EA Sports' NHL 06 for the XBOX. This entry in the NHL series builds on the 2005 version by adding new rules and an up to date rooster that includes just about every big name in the National Hockey League. NHL 06 includes everything from NHL 05, including the revamped shooting controls. New to the 2006 version is the use of the left analog stick for deking, which in hockey terms means to dodge and fake out defenders.

    <plot>The "best selling pro hockey franchise" is back with the 2004 edition, and it's loaded with more.[CR]Like Madden NFL 2004, NHL 2004 has a deep career mode, titled Dynasty Mode. You take on the role of GM for up to twenty seasons. As GM, you'll have to negotiate contracts, conduct drafts, make trades, sign free agents, make sure your players are getting the training they need, and more. If you're good enough, you may make it into the GM Hall of Fame.[CR]Besides Dynasty mode, you've got the basic game modes; Season, Exhibition, and Playoffs.[CR]The control for NHL 2004 has been refined, allowing for more precise movement than in the previous games. Precise passes, shots, and accurate skating are accomplished by simply tapping the button.[CR]NHL 2004 features a new fighting engine, allowing for more accurate and realistic fights. The right analog stick controls "Bruise Control", which lets you perform different moves by tilting the stick in different directions. Before you get into fights, you'll need to agitate a player, and this is where his Agitation Meter comes in. Losing the game, being checked, making sloppy passes all raises his Agitation Meter, until he is ready to burst and will fight at the slightest poke check.[CR]NHL 2004 contains the EA Sports Bio, which is a feature found on all console versions of EA Sports game. Playing more EA Sports titles, playing them for a long time, and winning special accomplishments (such as your first shutout in NHL 2004 or your first number one finish in NASCAR Thunder 2004) will earn you a higher Gamer Level, and will reward you with bonuses, such as cheat codes and new stadiums. This feature isn't found on the PC version.[CR]In addition to the standard roster of NHL teams, there are thirty nine international teams for you to choose from, such as Germany's DEL or Sweden's Elitserien, plus the usual U.S.A., Canada, and other regulars.[CR]The PlayStation 2 and Windows versions of NHL 2004 support online play.</plot>

    <plot>NHL 2005 features Open Ice Control, which according to EA allows better control, including moving players without the puck and also a complete World Cup mode where each team can be created from scratch. For the first time, the user was allowed to import digitized home arenas for the scratchbuilt teams (the 30 NHL arenas plus Nuremberg Arena, Kolnarena, Stockholm Globe Arena, Helsinki Hartwall Areena and Prague Sazka Arena were available). Additional NHL jerseys and logos were also available including those of the defunct Atlanta Flames, Winnipeg Jets, Colorado Rockies (NHL), Quebec Nordiques as well as the old style Los Angeles Kings, Washington Capitals and Vancouver Canucks uniforms of the 1970s and the 1980s.[CR]The IIHF license which granted the World Cup mode also allowed EA to use real-life international jerseys for the only time (previously released games used unique jerseys designed by the game's staff which only bore a passing similarity to their real life counterparts, so the jersey shows their flag.) The PC version of the game was stripped down to the bare essentials, including the omitting of the create-a-player feature. These omissions were possibly due to the labour dispute that season, but EA explained that they hadn't perfected the new create-a-player interface, which would have allowed for far greater customizability than what was previously available.</plot>

    <plot>The NHL Hitz series has been on all next-generation consoles since the early days of the 32-bit era. With that said, its no surprise that Midway brings NHL Hitz 20-03 to GameCube, with Hitz' trademark 'On-Fire Mode', over-the-top animations, and fully 3D crowds. Like all NHL Hitz games, NHL Hitz 20-03 features gameplay modes for up to 6 players, in-game fights and hidden teams, players and stadiums. The game will also feature Create-A-Player modes and mini-games.</plot>

    <plot>Naruto: Gekito Ninja Taisen! 4 is the fourth installment of this series. It covers the events from the Return of Itachi arc to the Sasuke Retrieval arc. The game also introduces the ability for multiple characters to fight one another at once, ranging from a 3-on-3 match to a 4-way brawl. Most noticeably, the game does away with the shop feature, and unlockables are now acquired by simply meeting certain criteria in the game's new Mission mode. Mission mode forces the player to fight increasingly stronger opponents under specific circumstances and with different methods of winning in order to complete each mission. This game was released exclusively in Japan.</plot>

    <plot>The Need for Speed series returns, this time reverting back to the 'chase' arcade experience instead of a racing simulation. Top speed racing is the name of the game, where you must outchase not just the opposing drivers, but the cops.[CR]Choose from a selection of today's (and yesterday's) top sports cars, including the Ferrari F50, Porsche 911 and a range from the likes of Ford, Corvette, BMW, Lotus, Mercedes, Aston Martin, the McLaren F1 and a lot more.[CR]The competitive race mode allows you to take on other drivers and beat them to the line. A selection of tracks allows you to not only dodge incoming traffic, but perform deadly jumps and stunts to receive points. These points, combined with the points recieved from your finishing position, can unlock new cars and tracks.[CR]The Hot Pursuit mode combines all the major elements of the competitive mode with the chance to out run the cops. They will throw everything at you to try and stop you, including running you off the road, setting up road blocks and unleashing an attack helicopter equiped with missiles. Three busts by the cops ends the race.</plot>

    <plot>Need For Speed Underground 2 takes place in Bayview after the events of Need for Speed: Underground. The prologue begins with the player driving in a Nissan Skyline R34 in Olympic City (though the racing scenes are actually in Bayview), the setting of NFS:UG. He then receives a race challenge from a rather ominous personality who offers him a spot on his crew, but "won't take 'no' for an answer." The player races off -- despite Samantha's warnings -- only to be ambushed by a mysterious driver in a rage that totals his Skyline. The driver, who has a unique scythe tattoo, makes a call confirming the accident, and the flashback fades out.</plot>

    <plot>Need For Speed Underground 2 takes place in Bayview after the events of Need for Speed: Underground. The prologue begins with the player driving in a Nissan Skyline R34 in Olympic City (though the racing scenes are actually in Bayview), the setting of NFS:UG. He then receives a race challenge from a rather ominous personality who offers him a spot on his crew, but "won't take 'no' for an answer." The player races off -- despite Samantha's warnings -- only to be ambushed by a mysterious driver in a rage that totals his Skyline. The driver, who has a unique scythe tattoo, makes a call confirming the accident, and the flashback fades out.</plot>

    <plot>Based on the animated television program of the same name, Avatar: The Last Airbender follows the adventures of a group of kids living in an Asian-inspired fantasy world where the nations have been divided up according to the four classical elements: Air, Water, Earth, and Fire. Within each nation are people who can control that one element, known as benders. The Avatar is a person who can control all four elements, and is charged with keeping peace between the four nations. However, 100 years previous the Avatar had disappeared, making it possible for the Fire Nation to wage a war of conquest across the world. As the show begins, the new Avatar, Aang (originally an Airbender, hence the title of the series), has been found, and now he must travel the world, learning how to bend all four elements and fighting against the Fire Nation alongside his friends Katara (a Waterbender of the Water Tribe) and Sokka (her older brother).[CR]In the game, the player may choose one of four characters: Aang, Katara, Sokka, and Haru (an Earthbender). Each character's fighting style and abilities are unique, and new abilities can be gained as they earn experience by defeating enemies. Items are also available to assist the player, such as armor, chi, accessories, and healing potions. As an action/adventure game, the gameplay is viewed from top-down perspective, with the player battling enemies and searching for specific items required the complete the quests necessary to progress further into the game. The story unfolds over several chapters, and players cannot return to previous areas.[CR]Set between the first and second seasons of the show, the game follows Aang and friends as they investigate the disappearance of a young Waterbender, and find themselves in pursuit of an inventor named Lian the Maker, who has been forced to create dangerous machines for the Fire Nation. As they travel between the Water Tribe and Earth Kingdom, the characters battle Fire Nation soldiers, strange animals, and various machines. Some other characters from the world of Avatar also make minor appearances in the game, including Prince Zuko, who appears during cut scenes only.</plot>

Responding to the distress call, you hurry to save a spaceship, a space station which has had its reactor put on self-destruct to prevent the station from falling into the enemies hands, and the lunar base that have become infested with Creatures.[CR]The spaceship, although seemingly abandoned by the Creature, has inside, guard dogs and beastoids that fire weapons. They were left behind by their master. You must survive their attack to find life-sustaining supplies and the key to disarm the reactor. Upon receiving these, you must safely return to your ship to start your journey to the terror-filled space station. The space station has much greater danger. You must gather more essential supplies, but more importantly, you must disarm the reactor before it self-destructs. You have the key, but where is the reactor? Once this step of your mission has been done, you must make your way back out while trying to get past the alien attack droids, acid leaks, and more vicious beastoids.</plot>

Responding to the distress call, you hurry to save a spaceship, a space station which has had its reactor put on self-destruct to prevent the station from falling into the enemies hands, and the lunar base that have become infested with Creatures.[CR]The spaceship, although seemingly abandoned by the Creature, has inside, guard dogs and beastoids that fire weapons. They were left behind by their master. You must survive their attack to find life-sustaining supplies and the key to disarm the reactor. Upon receiving these, you must safely return to your ship to start your journey to the terror-filled space station. The space station has much greater danger. You must gather more essential supplies, but more importantly, you must disarm the reactor before it self-destructs. You have the key, but where is the reactor? Once this step of your mission has been done, you must make your way back out while trying to get past the alien attack droids, acid leaks, and more vicious beastoids.</plot>

It was released in October 2005 for the Xbox, PlayStation 2, GameCube, Game Boy Advance, and the PC. It was released for the Nintendo DS in Korea in 2007, but its North American release was cancelled. It is the first SpongeBob SquarePants title to feature multiplayer mini-games, similar to the Mario Party video game series. It is also the last SpongeBob game for the Xbox. This marks the only time that the Dirty Bubble is voiced by Charles Nelson Reilly in a video game before his death in 2007. This is the first video game where Mermaid Man is voiced by Joe Alaskey, who would voice him again in SpongeBob SquarePants: Creature from the Krusty Krab.</plot>

    <plot>The children of the tortoise and the hare have decided to set aside their traditional family differences and go off on a grand adventure together. But the land has grown more filled with threats since Aesop's day -- our unlikely duo must cooperate intimately in order to make progress. The hare invites the tortoise up onto his shoulders, transporting the two left or right following the mouse cursor, while the tortoise, armed with a pea-shooter (aimed with vertical mouse movements and shot by clicking), knocks down delicious fruit from overhanging trees and neutralises unkindly bombardier birds, causing them to deliver their payload prematurely -- ideally onto snakes slithering underfoot. Not just friendship but teamwork and quick reflexes will be needed to see this trip through to its end!</plot>

The game was produced and designed by Seaman creator, Yutaka Saito.[CR]Odama blends tactical wargaming with pinball gameplay. The game takes place in a feudal Japan setting. The main character is a young general named Yamanouchi Kagetora, who is intent on avenging his father's death by reviving the most ingenious weapon ever to hit the medieval battlefield: the Odama. The Odama is a gigantic ball powerful enough to destroy whatever it strikes, friend or foe. Using giant flippers, players aim the Odama to bowl over enemies, shatter their defenses and wreak havoc on the battlefield. With the Nintendo GameCube Microphone, players direct their soldiers out of the Odama's way and into the fray by charging the enemy, defending positions and seizing the enemy gates.</plot>

    <plot>One Piece Grand Battle 3 plays like Grand Battle 2, but now you are able to move in 3-d. The game's plot is based mostly on the arabasta and skypiea saga. There are 16 characters in the game each with their own unique fighting style. You are able to use items to your advantage and for strategy. The only problem i had with this game was there should have been more characters and stages and possibly more special moves for the characters. Otherwise it's still a great game overall. Another great part of this game is the event battle. In this mode you get to experience the story of one piece or just some little scenarios. Like at the final battle you may get to watch a dramatic cutscene with the two characters encountering each other. For example this may include Luffy verus Enel, Sanji verus Zoro, Chopper vs Ohm, and many others. I recommend this game if your a one piece fan or if you just love 3-d fighters.</plot>

    <plot>Long ago, back in medieval times, an evil spirit known as Spooky had terrorized all of Pac-Land. In response to this, the great Wizard Pac created a potion that turned 5 ordinary fruit into the "Golden Fruit." A young knight called Sir Pac-alot fought and sealed Spooky underneath a large tree using the Golden Fruit, which were attached to the branches of the tree. In the present time late at night, Inky, Pinky, Blinky and Clyde sneak into the village and, in their mischief, pick the Golden Fruit off the tree in the center of town. Unfortunately, this has released Spooky from his prison. Spooky tells the ghosts to take the Golden Fruit and follow him if they wish to rid the land of the Pac-people forever. When Pac-Man awakes, he hears the news from Professor Pac about the Golden Fruit and Spooky, and sets off to defeat the ghosts and Spooky.</plot>

    <plot>Gobble! Munch! Vroom![CR]The game is packed with not only the traditional Dots to consume and enemies to avoid, but also with power-ups and temporary advantages which players should use strategically to win the race and beat opponents. One example is a power slide to turn corners at full speed. Of course, enemies can also be bitten after eating a Power Pellet.</plot>

    <plot>Peter Jackson's King Kong: The Official Game of the Movie is an action-adventure video game based on the 2005 film King Kong and created in collaboration between the film's director Peter Jackson and video game designer Michel Ancel.[CR]The game allows players to play as both Jack Driscoll and King Kong. The King Kong segment are played from a third-person perspective, while Driscoll's levels are played from a first-person perspective. De-emphasizes the role of a heads-up display as the developer thought that this can help players to further immerse into the game.[CR]It was released on PC and sixth generation platforms and a Nintendo DS version on November 21, 2005, while it was released on November 22, 2005 on the Xbox 360 as a launch title, as well as a Game Boy Advance version titled Kong: The 8th Wonder of the World, also a PlayStation Portable version was released December 20, 2005. All film cast members reprise their roles. Upon release, the game received a generally positive reception, with critics praising the game's immersive environments.

    <plot>Twenty-two years after making his groundbreaking debut on the Atari 2600, Activision's Pitfall Harry returns for more jungle-exploring action. The intrepid adventurer is brought to life for more than 50 perilous levels set in such exotic South American locales as rainforests, glaciers, mines, and ancient ruins. As in the original, players must utilize Harry's athletic prowess to swing from vines, run from rolling logs, hop over treacherous pits, avoid snapping crocodiles, and more, while trying to survive the hostile environment.[CR]His objectives? To retrieve lost artifacts before they fall into the hands of his rival and to save those in danger. Pitfall Harry will eventually encounter situations that even he can't conquer with a well-timed jump or two, so players can pull items stored in his knapsack to assist him. Like the character's single foray on the original PlayStation, this game is designed to make players smile while exploring the mysterious lands before them. Although Pitfall 3D made use of Bruce Campbell's voice for its comic effect, Pitfall Harry attempts to use its visuals to elicit grins, with the protagonist drawn as a caricature, with a large head balanced atop a slender body.[CR]As the story begins, Harry is a member of a treasure-hunting expedition whose plane goes down in the forest. The other survivors are scattered throughout the game; an older, wiser adventurer who was on the plane -- and who becomes incapacitated during the accident -- urges Harry to embark on a quest to save them while battling a rival, eco-unfriendly group of treasure hunters for the relics of the jungle so they can be returned to their rightful owners. He hands Harry the "Hero's Handbook" and Harry's off to adventure. The "Hero's Handbook's" pages are scattered throughout the levels just like the crash survivors are. Find new pages, and Harry will learn new moves.</plot>

    <plot>Twenty-two years after making his groundbreaking debut on the Atari 2600, Activision's Pitfall Harry returns for more jungle-exploring action. The intrepid adventurer is brought to life for more than 50 perilous levels set in such exotic South American locales as rainforests, glaciers, mines, and ancient ruins. As in the original, players must utilize Harry's athletic prowess to swing from vines, run from rolling logs, hop over treacherous pits, avoid snapping crocodiles, and more, while trying to survive the hostile environment.[CR]His objectives? To retrieve lost artifacts before they fall into the hands of his rival and to save those in danger. Pitfall Harry will eventually encounter situations that even he can't conquer with a well-timed jump or two, so players can pull items stored in his knapsack to assist him. Like the character's single foray on the original PlayStation, this game is designed to make players smile while exploring the mysterious lands before them. Although Pitfall 3D made use of Bruce Campbell's voice for its comic effect, Pitfall Harry attempts to use its visuals to elicit grins, with the protagonist drawn as a caricature, with a large head balanced atop a slender body.[CR]As the story begins, Harry is a member of a treasure-hunting expedition whose plane goes down in the forest. The other survivors are scattered throughout the game; an older, wiser adventurer who was on the plane -- and who becomes incapacitated during the accident -- urges Harry to embark on a quest to save them while battling a rival, eco-unfriendly group of treasure hunters for the relics of the jungle so they can be returned to their rightful owners. He hands Harry the "Hero's Handbook" and Harry's off to adventure. The "Hero's Handbook's" pages are scattered throughout the levels just like the crash survivors are. Find new pages, and Harry will learn new moves.</plot>

    <plot>Pokemon Channel, released in Japan as Pokemon Channel ~Together with Pikachu!~ (pokemonchiyanneru ~pikachiyuutoitsushiyo!~ Pokemon Channeru ~Pikachu to Issho!~?), is a 2003 video game in the Pokemon series for the GameCube, developed by Ambrella and published by Nintendo and The Pokemon Company. The player's goal is to help Professor Oak refine and promote his TV network through watching broadcasts with a Pikachu. The game contains elements of the adventure, digital pet, and simulation genres. The player can explore full 3D environments, have Pikachu converse with other Pokemon, and collect various items.[CR]The game was developed rather quickly as a sequel to the Nintendo 64 title Hey You, Pikachu! and to promote the Nintendo e-Reader accessory, and uses a novel 3D texturing effect. It was first showcased at Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) 2003 and later through a month-long series of promotional events in Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan. It was released on July 18, 2003, in Japan, December 1 in North America, and April 2, 2004, in Europe. In Japan, the game sold 66,373 copies in its first year. It received mixed reviews, which generally criticized its low level of interactivity and repetitive sound effects, though its collecting aspects and visuals were somewhat better received.</plot>

    <plot>Radirgy is a vertically scrolling shoot 'em up with bullet hell elements, and features a bright cel shaded graphical style. The game features an arcade mode with five stages, a score attack mode, scalable difficulty, and bonus modes depending on the platform. The story follows a blue-haired schoolgirl named Shizuru Kamigusa, who is allergic to radio waves. Her father works for a company developing a remedy for the condition, but a terrorist group led by Ruki Michima takes over their building. Shizuru mans a flying mecha called a "terminal suit" to save her father and the medicine from the terrorists. Dialog appears on the playfield throughout the game and can be dismissed by pressing a button, although this feature can be disabled.[CR]The game features bullet hell gameplay elements, providing the player with a small hit box and swarms of particles to evade. Most of the bullets come in patternless waves with the exception for the mini-bosses and stage bosses which feature more regular patterns. The player may choose from three different ships each with a different spead setting, and may also choose from three different weapons: spread gun, homing laser, and bubble cannon. Each of these weapons features different ranges and speeds, so the player must utilize different strategies with them. They can also be powered up throughout the game. Once the game is started, the player is equipped with their main weapon, sword, and shield. The short-range sword can be used to destroy the same bullets and enemies the guns can destroy, but can also deflect items. This deflection mechanic allows the player to "juggle" items and power-ups until they are desired. When not firing, the terminal suit will automatically deploy a shield which can be used to deflect certain enemy bullets. A combo bar, which determines the score multiplier, can be increased by either using the shield to harvest energy from bullets or enemies or using the ABSNET shield, a weapon similar to Giga Wing or Mars Matrix which eliminates all minor enemies and projectiles on the screen. In order to use the ABSNET shield, the player gather blue items which drop from destroyed enemies to fill the ABSNET gauge. The combo bar slowly dissipates over time</plot>

    <plot>Rave Master, titled Rave (reivu Reivu?, romanized as RAVE) in Japan and also known there as The Groove Adventure Rave, is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Hiro Mashima. The series follows Haru Glory, a teenager in a quest to find the five pieces of the sacred stone Rave in order to bring peace to the world by defeating the criminal group Demon Card. Mashima created this series with the idea of travelling around the world and was presented with difficulties in its serialization due to its considerable length.[CR]The manga was serialized in Weekly Shonen Magazine from July 1999 through July 2005, and published in thirty-five tankobon volumes by Kodansha. The manga series was licensed for an English release in North America by Tokyopop until Kodansha allowed their contract to expire. It was also adapted into a fifty-one episode anime series by Studio Deen. The anime premiered on TBS on October 13, 2001 and ran until September 28, 2002. Tokyopop also licensed the anime adaptation which premiered on Cartoon Network in the United States on June 5, 2004 as part of the Toonami programming block, and re-broadcast on Syfy in 2009.[CR]The manga series has received generally positive critical response with praise commonly aimed towards the storyline and artwork. On the other hand, the anime adaptation has been panned for the multiple edits Tokyopop made to the original version resulting in uninteresting and confusing dialogues as well as unappealing music.</plot>

    <plot>Globox, a friend of Rayman, has placed the world into a deadly possibility. By eating Andre, the Lord of the Dark Lums, Globox has enraged the Hoodlums, who plan to take back their master no matter what the cost to the world around them. It's up to Rayman to save the day and find a cure to rid the Dark Lord from Globox. [CR]Rayman 3: Hoodlum Havoc is a 3D third-person platform game. Rayman, the main hero, jumps and punches his way through numerous colorful levels, with Globox (and Andre inside him) tagging along and occasionally commenting on the goings-on. Rayman's main weapon is his fist; he can use it to shoot projectiles at the attacking Hoodlums and other foes, and the projectiles are more powerful when the fist is charged by holding down the "shoot" button. [CR]The game is divided into several worlds, each divided into a couple of levels; the game is saved automatically after each level. In between the worlds, the player has to complete a mini-game where he has to surf along light-beams in a psychedelic environment. [CR]Rayman can also come across power-ups which temporarily give him a special power: the green power-up allows him to shoot tornadoes, the blue power-up gives him the ability to use a grappling hook, the yellow power-up allows him to fly for a short while, the orange power-up allows him to shoot precisely guided missiles and the red power-up grants him a very powerful fist that can bash doors. These power-ups are always necessary to defeat an enemy or a boss, or to get to the next part of the level. [CR]Rayman can find and free the Teensies locked in cages throughout the level; the freed Teensies will express their gratitude by opening up the next part of the map or by summoning some bonuses to collect. Each six Teensies freed increases Rayman's health bar. [CR]There are numerous bonuses hidden throughout the levels; completing the levels with lots of score will unlock humorous animations and mini-games. [CR]The Game Boy Advance Rayman 3 links to the Gamecube through the link port, allowing you to play exclusive mini-games on both systems, and download new levels to the GBA.[CR]The PS3 and Xbox 360 versions are straight ports of the original game with HD textures and a smooth framerate. They also add nine short mini-games.</plot>

    <plot>In the year 2075, five years after the events of Red Faction, on Mars, the nanotechnology developed by Capek has been claimed by the Earth Defense Force (EDF). With this technology, the EDF commences a reorganization of the Ultor Corporation with a particular focus on enhanced supersoldiers and suitable weaponry. However, the research that was done by Capek in his laboratories has been consequently stolen by other militant groups and assorted terrorist organizations. This has gone on for years; the research has changed hands in the criminal underworld many times. The player is introduced to the role of an explosives expert (codenamed "Alias"), as he embarks on a special operations mission to claim the research data for the Republic of the Commonwealth.[CR]Eventually, the research was successfully claimed by the elite forces of Victor Sopot, Chancellor of the dystopic military state known as The Commonwealth. Sopot uses the nanotechnology to enhance his already formidable military forces, and successfully creates the first supersoldiers with the research data. Fearing the potential of his new supersoldiers, he orders them all to be hunted down and executed at once and replaced with far less intelligent, mutated horrors known as "The Processed".</plot>

    <plot>Special forces S.T.A.R.S. Bravo team's helicopter malfunctioned and crashed during their mission, disappearing into the Arklay Mountains. This and what happens to them is told in the story of Resident Evil Zero. Now, S.T.A.R.S. Alpha team is sent on a mission to investigate a series of murders around Raccoon Forest. Spotting the Bravo team's helicopter, or what's left of it, they land nearby and investigate the surrounding area. Unaware of what they might expect, one member is attacked and devoured by zombified dobermans. The rest of the team, with a little bit of luck, find shelter in a nearby mansion, not knowing it was probably better to stay out.[CR]You play the entire game with one of the two selectable characters, Chris Redfield, or Jill Valentine. The starting point is the lobby of the mansion the three surviving S.T.A.R.S. members just stepped in. After a short while, the team decides to split and search for any possible survivors or anything useful that may help them break out of this dreadful place. To their amazement, they encountered an enemy they never were trained to confront, zombies. There is only one mission to be considered now: survival.[CR]The GameCube and the later Wii versions are largely a remake of the original Resident Evil for the PlayStation, with some additions. While the floorplan of the returning locations is almost entirely unchanged, several new areas have been added in, extending your stay in the mansion. A new enemy, Lisa, has been added to the game, making your trips outside of the mansion much more dangerous. Finally killing a zombie is now no longer good enough to put them to rest. They must be destroyed totally with fire or else they will rise again; faster, deadlier, and madder than before.[CR]The 2015 PS3, PS4, Xbox 360, Xbox One and Windows version called Resident Evil (also known as Biohazard: HD Remaster) is a remastered version of GameCube remake of the original Resident Evil with enhanced graphics and sounds, widescreen support and an alternative control scheme next to the default one. Additionally, when starting a new game, the player can choose between original character models, or Chris and Jill models from Resident Evil 5 which came after the original GameCube release.</plot>

    <plot>Ribbit is a Frogger variant which in most ways works just the same as the arcade original. The player controls a frog that first has to cross a interstate highway without being hit by a vehicle and then a river without falling into the water. The aim of the game is to reach the holes on the opposite end and get a frog into each hole. When successful the game moves on to the next level where traffic moves faster and the river has less logs and turtles to jump onto. The player starts out with three lives and one is lost every time the frog is hit, falls in the river, moves outside the screen or doesn't move quick enough. Each frog has about 35 seconds to reach a hole. Later levels have some surprises including a stomper trying to get the player.[CR]In addition to the regular mode, there is also a demo mode. The demo mode has no limit on the number of lives but there is neither any scoring shown on the screen.</plot>

    <plot>Road Trip: Arcade Edition is the GameCube edition in the Road Trip series of racing games. This game allows you to race tiny little toy cars around various oversized environments. Most of the cars resemble super-deformed versions of popular automobiles, but the actual model names are not used. There are dozens of tiny cars to collect.[CR]Some of the tracks in this game appear to be scaled to the size of your racer, others take place in oversized real-world environments, like a house or a garden.[CR]The usual racing game modes are present, single race, championship, and multi-player. Winning races allows you to purchase upgrades and other vehicles. You can also link this game with Road Trip: Shifting Gears.</plot>

    <plot>Set in the future, Roadkill is a racing game featuring all manner of gruesome additions. There are 9 computer opponents in each race, and you must finish in the top 3 every time. Rockets and homing missiles can be collected so as to shoot the rival cars out. The tracks feature inbuilt hazards and treacherous shortcuts.[CR]Money is a big factor in all of this - the higher you finish in a race, the more you get; it can be collected during the race; each car you destroy gives you more money than the previous one, as you go for the Jackpot and then the Super Jackpot.</plot>

    <plot>RoboCop(titled RoboCop: Aratanaru Kiki in Japan) is a 2003 first person shooter released for the sixth generation home consoles. The only North American version available was released for the Xbox while the PAL region versions were released on all consoles except for Game Boy Advance.[18] A Japan-only version was released on GameCube. This was the last game Titus Software developed before going bankrupt in 2005.[CR]The game allows the player to play as RoboCop and to uncover a sinister plot involving OCP, local gangsters dealing a deadly new synthetic drug and a powerful cyborg known only as MIND. As a last hope, RoboCop must capture, destroy, or arrest hostile characters in a desperate search for clues and evidence.[CR]The game received mostly negative reviews by critics. GameSpot rated it 2.2/10, the official Xbox Magazine UK rated it a mediocre 5.9/10, GamerFeed gave it a 2/5, Xbox Magazine gave 2/10, and NTSC UK rated it 3/10.[19] The Scandinavian magazine Gamereactor gave the game 1/10[20] and called it "the worst videogame since Superman 64" (also from Titus Software).</plot>

    <plot>In the last few years of the 19th century many young adventurers travel to Africa in search of diamonds. One such young man is Englishman Ricky Rockman who aims to dig his way through the mines and return home with plenty of riches. It's not an easy job though. Not only has he watch out for falling boulders but also the vile creatures that patrol the mines. [CR]Rockman is a Boulder Dash variant. The aim of the game is to collect all the diamonds for each level. Throughout the levels are also boulders and monsters that wander around. Boulders follow the laws of gravity and fall down when the player digs a hole below them. The player then has to be quick or he might be crushed by them. Boulders can also be used to kill the monsters. When all diamonds in a level has been collected a gate leading to the next will open. The player has three lives and they will be used if he comes into contact with a monster or is crushed by a boulder. There is also a time limit.</plot>

    <plot>Gamers return to the slopes in this third full edition of EA's exaggerated-action snowboarding series, SSX. As the game goes "On Tour," players create their own custom characters, which they'll develop from amateur bunny-hillers to seasoned "Black Diamond" pros. For the first time, the game allows skiers on the mountains as well, and players can decide if they'd rather ski or board when they create their characters. Building upon a distinguishing feature of the series, SSX On Tour features long, seamlessly streaming courses, some of which may take as long as half-an-hour (of real-time) to complete. The slopes are populated with fellow boarders and skiers in this edition, providing some extra personality. Featuring more than 40 songs, the diverse rock soundtrack includes selections by Def Leppard, The Hives, Iron Maiden, Bloc Party, Jurassic 5, and several others.</plot>

    <plot>Gamers return to the slopes in this third full edition of EA's exaggerated-action snowboarding series, SSX. As the game goes "On Tour," players create their own custom characters, which they'll develop from amateur bunny-hillers to seasoned "Black Diamond" pros. For the first time, the game allows skiers on the mountains as well, and players can decide if they'd rather ski or board when they create their characters. Building upon a distinguishing feature of the series, SSX On Tour features long, seamlessly streaming courses, some of which may take as long as half-an-hour (of real-time) to complete. The slopes are populated with fellow boarders and skiers in this edition, providing some extra personality. Featuring more than 40 songs, the diverse rock soundtrack includes selections by Def Leppard, The Hives, Iron Maiden, Bloc Party, Jurassic 5, and several others.</plot>

    <plot>Action-combat game, features seamless animations to match the show it's based on. Jack will move through four realms and 24 levels ranging from a village to a city from the future in Aku's universe, each with interactive backgrounds including sliceable ropes, breakable doors and secret passages. The enemy roster highlights Aku, Mad Jack and the Scotsman among 25 other creatures. The primarily action-based game arms Jack with 25 signature moves, the ability to hurl shurikens, fire arrows from bows, and utilize four elemental swords. Players can even hand enemies their pink slip on life in a tongue-in-cheek bullet-time mode called "Sakai Mode." Created in collaboration with the show's creator, Genndy Tartakovsky, and the original voice cast.</plot>

    <plot>Fred brings the rest of Mystery, Inc. along to meet his cousin, Jed, who works at the Monstrous Fright and Magic. MFM is a special effects company that creates monster costumes with a special formula they invented called, "Mubber", that makes the costumes seems so real that the wearer literally becomes the actual monster. When they arrive, they found the location in shambles. Winslow Stanton, the creator of Mubber and owner of MFM, told them someone has stolen the Mubber formula and by using it with their animatrons, destroyed the building and disappeared. He believes it is Jed's doing because he, too, disappeared. Looks like it's up to Scooby and the gang to find Jed, destroy the costumed monsters and unmask the truth behind this great mystery![CR]In Scooby-Doo! Unmasked, you will guide Scooby to help Mystery, Inc. uncover clues, fight monsters and occasionally save your friends from danger. You will be visiting many several worlds including a China Town and a museum. You will encounter various monsters like the Chinese Zombie and the Black Knight and the only way to get past them is by attacking them with your spin, slide, roll and smash attacks! Also, by collecting mubbers, you can create special costumes that will give you special powers. For example, with the Kung Fu Costume, you will be able to move around with greater agility and force. Be sure to watch your health level which is indicated by the number of Scooby Medals you have. If you reach zero, you will restart at the last save point but you can restore your health by collecting enough Scooby snacks that can be found throughout the game. Also, by collecting food items you can get Shaggy to cook you a special meal that will increase the total number of medals you have.[CR]In each world, when you've collected enough clues, Velma will ask you a few questions in order to figure out who is behind everything, and you must select the clues that you feel will answer these questions. When that's completed, you will have to fight a boss before Velma will reveal who the identity of the villain.[CR]Scooby-Doo! Unmasked can be saved at any point in the game simply by selecting Save Game in the Pause Menu. You can also turn on the Autosave function which will enable the game to automatically save at different points. You can replay any level as many times as you want so you can collect any missing items you still lack. In the extra menu, you will find Bonus Arts that features various conceptual art pieces used in the making of the game.</plot>

    <plot>Hidden away in underground leagues and counter-culture clubs, Sega introduces a brutal new brand of soccer. Played by thugs who kick ass on and off the field, participants opt to watch their backs and let the crowds watch the game. Since nastiness supplants sportsmanship in this 3-on-3 hybrid of the world's most popular sport, the rulebook is only good as a splint for broken bones.[CR]Given its rule-bending recipe, Soccer Slam is an exciting and original game, in which individual achievement prevails over teamwork while gameplay focuses on speed, skill, and aggression. This means that players don't just take on the competition, they take 'em out!</plot>

    <plot>Shaman King: Soul Fight! is a 2003 cel-shaded fighting game with turn-based strategy elements for the Nintendo Gamecube developed by Tuning Electronic, and published by Bandai. It is based upon the anime and manga Shaman King, written by Hiroyuki Takei. It follows the journey of Yoh Asakura and his friends in the quest to become Shaman King. There are 26 characters and five game modes to choose from: "Story Mode", "Shaman Fight Mode", "Tutorial Mode", "Shaman King Mode" and "Omake Mode". Soul Fight is one of the only console games developed by Tuning Electronic, a company which has developed a small number of low-budget arcade games.[CR]This game sold well in Japan and even gained a "Bandai The Best" version, but never made it to the US due to Konami securing exclusivity rights to video games for the franchise in the west.[CR]Players may choose from a cast of 20+ characters featured in the series to do battle. Fighting is essentially a game of rock-paper-scissors. Characters have 3 different attacks with attributes that may be customized to their liking. Attacks are chosen and played out on-screen by the characters who are indirectly controlled. Successful attacks build a crystal meter to launch cinematic specials that come in three levels, each a step up in strength from the last. The game also features a lengthy fully voiced story mode that follows the anime and a character training mode. There are a variety of unlockables, including much of the playable cast as hidden characters.</plot>

    <plot>Game based on the second movie, developed by the makers of Vigilante 8. Shrek is on a journey to meet his in-laws, so Shrek 2 follows his adventure to Far Away Land and the chaos that ensues once Fiona's parents learn that their precious daughter is an ogre -- and is married to the crudest of them all. Shrek 2 features a mixture of puzzle solving and enemy bashing. Players are able to control one of four characters at any given time -- swapping between them at will. Each character has a set of basic attack moves and a special ability. Donkey has a "Burro Blast" that can knock down large objects, Shrek can pick up and throw heavy objects, and Fiona -- in a nod to her fight scene in the first movie -- can slow down time, Matrix-style.</plot>

Bustin' Out was released for the Game Boy Advance, GameCube, PlayStation 2, Xbox and N-Gage in the fourth quarter of 2003.

    <plot>Smashing Drive puts you in the driver's seat of an insane, outrageous taxi on the busy streets of New York City. Your job is to simply race from point to point in the fastest time possible.[CR]The key to success in Smashing Drive lies in two features: crazy power-ups and hidden shortcuts. Almost all of the power-ups transform your taxi in some way that allows you to smash your way through traffic with ease. And the shortcuts usually involve crashing through the insides of buildings, like movie theaters and sports arenas.</plot>

    <plot>Sonic and company are back and better than ever in Sonic Adventure 2: Battle for Nintendo GameCube. Dr. Eggman is up to his old tricks, and it's up to Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles to stop him yet again. Sonic Adventure 2: Battle features faster action, all-new two-player games, and a branching storyline that lets you choose to save the world as the Hero side, or conquer it as the Dark side.[CR]Two new playable characters enter the Sonic universe -- a mysterious dark hedgehog called Shadow, and a jewel-thieving bat named Rouge. In the single-player mode, you'll go through more than 30 unique stages, which include everything from a forgotten pyramid, an abandoned military base, and a giant space station. Then there's the expanded two-player mode, which features 12 playable characters competing in new head-to-head games. All of this adds up to Sonic's biggest adventure yet!</plot>

    <plot>Space Raiders is an early Star Raiders clone. You begin the game viewing a map of the galaxy, which shows how many alien starships and starbases occupy each sector. Your mission is to clear the aliens from all sectors. Upon entering a sector, the view changes to a first-person perspective flying through space, where you must move a crosshair reticule around the screen and blast the aliens. Your supply of energy is limited but can be refilled upon visiting a starbase. The aliens look like tie-fighters and the starbases resemble the Death Star.</plot>

Released in Europe and North America in October, it is a spin-off of the Total War series.[CR]The plot revolves around a Spartan warrior, secretly guided by the god Ares, as he fights alongside his Greek allies against the invading Roman Empire. While the Total War series traditionally focuses upon real historical scenarios, the plot of Spartan: Total Warrior is fictional, involving figures from both Greek and Roman mythology, and featuring many ahistorical elements (the most obvious being the Roman Empire and the Spartan state did not exist at the same time in history). It is also the only installment in the series to have been released for video game consoles rather than PCs or Macs. It was the first Total War game published by Sega, who had purchased Creative Assembly earlier in 2005.[CR]Spartan received a mixed to positive reception. Although some reviewers found the game to be a glorified button-masher, and criticized the combat as repetitive, others praised the game engine and the scope of the battles.</plot>

    <plot>Based on the movie of the same name, Spider-Man 2 once again places the player in the web-slinger's tights as he goes up against Dr. Octopus in this 3D adventure game. [CR]Unlike the first game, however, the sequel is much more open-ended, allowing Spider-Man free reign to explore New York City and performing everyday heroics; stopping muggers, bank robberies and car-jackers to more mundane pursuits such as delivering pizzas and snapping photos for the Daily Bugle. [CR]However, the action becomes even more intense as not only does Spidey have to keep the streets safe in general for the citizens of Manhattan, he also has to face up against such super villains as Rhino, Shocker, Mysterio and Calypso, as well as a few entanglements with the Black Cat along the way to square off against Dr. Octopus and save New York in the process!</plot>

    <plot>Spyro: A Hero's Tail is the fifth console game in the original Spyro series and the ninth game in the series in all. Developed by Eurocom, it was the first game in the series for the Xbox, as well as the second game in the series for the PlayStation 2 and GameCube (with the former console release being the only one of the three to support widescreen). It is also the final installment in the original Spyro continuity for home consoles. This is also the first and only Spyro game to be completely produced in Europe.[CR]The game introduces a new antagonist, Red, a former Dragon Elder banished years before the events of the game, and sees the protagonist, Spyro the Dragon, attempt to defeat him with the aid of his best friend Sparx, Hunter the Cheetah, flying penguin Sgt. Byrd, and mole Blink, who are all playable.</plot>

    <plot>Star Wars is a first-person shooter based around the final scenes of the original Star Wars film. It first appeared for arcade coin-operated machines and was subsequently converted to other gaming platforms.[CR]You take on the role of Luke Skywalker, aiming to destroy the Death Star. In the first phase you have to pass swarms of TIE Fighters, including dogfighting the one piloted by Darth Vader himself. In the second phase the station's surface is protected by laser towers, third involves attacking its weakest spot - the unprotected exhaust port - with proton torpedos. Your X-Wing starts with six shields, but more can be awarded for good performance. Complete the game and it loops back around at ever-increasing difficulty.[CR]The game uses vector graphics, which allow lots of action at high speed on comparatively slow systems.</plot>

    <plot>Rogue is a turn-based dungeon crawler in which the player controls an adventurer who must explore the dangerous Dungeon of Doom in order to retrieve the precious Amulet of Yendor and make it out alive. The player character starts on the upper-most level and slowly makes his way downwards.[CR]The game uses ASCII characters to represent locations, items, monsters, and the protagonist himself. There are twenty-six different types of monsters, symbolized by their initial letters (e.g. L for Leprechaun). Monsters have different abilities and modes of attack. The dungeon and the items in it are randomly generated each time the player begins a new game. Each dungeon level contains a grid of three by three rooms and dead ends. [CR]Levels get progressively more complex and maze-like, and monsters grow in strength the deeper the hero ventures into the dungeon. The player character can acquire better weapons and armor, gain experience points and level up. Should the protagonist perish in the dungeon, the player must restart the game anew.</plot>

    <plot>Starsky and Hutch is an arcade racing game based on the popular TV series from the 70s, released to tie in with the film. The game includes 18 missions, each based on an episode of the TV show and introduced by Antonio 'Huggy Bear' Fargas. There is also a free roaming mode, in which the player explores the GTA-esque environment looking for action and trouble.[CR]Like the film, the game does not entirely play it straight. Starsky and Hutch are actually shooting a TV show, and the scoring for each mission reflects how ratings-friendly your driving is. You are awarded gold, silver or bronze medals for each mission depending on performance, and must get at least 1 gold and 2 silvers on season 1 for a second season to be commissioned, and 3 golds and 2 silvers in season 2 for there to be a third for you to play through.[CR]The overall goal in each mission is usually to chase and destroy a criminal's car. There is always a secondary target as well. In addition, the player will gain viewers by hitting the bad guy, pulling off elaborate jumps and skids, nearly hitting civilians, and hitting the bonus targets such as canisters which are strewn through the levels. Hitting civilians will lose viewers.</plot>

The game has real life streetballers such as 1/2 Man 1/2 Amazing, Hot Sauce, and Headache, and is a less dramatic, more realistic game than NBA Street, as the characters cannot jump completely over the hoop. Like NBA Street, it is possible to create custom baller, and play on real life courts. The game has 3 different modes: World Tournament, Lord of the Court, and Pick-up Game.</plot>

    <plot>Strike Force Bowling is a video game of the sports genre released in 2004 by LAB Rats. A previous game, Fast Lanes Bowling, was published by Enlight Software. The two games are very similar sharing the same physics engine and graphics, although Strike Force featured more locations as well as left-handed, and reverse-hook bowlers. LAB Rats assisted in the development of Brunswick Circuit Pro Bowling so the game has the same physics engine, but has a more fantasy-oriented theme. Strike Force features 14 places to Bowl (12 in Fast Lanes) and 8 Playable characters. There are only 7 locations, but each has its own "nighttime" variant which is unlocked as a secret stage. It also features Golf Mode, Challenge Mode, Skins, and Tournaments. There are also 14 different bowling balls to use, such as the Lightning, and level specific ones like the Bone Crasher and Pharaoh's Magic.</plot>

    <plot>Bust-A-Move (also known as Puzzle Bobble) is a real-time puzzle game in which the player controls a device called "pointer" at the bottom of the screen, aiming and releasing randomly colored bubbles upwards. Depending on the aiming, the bubbles may float up directly or bounce off the walls, changing their trajectory. The goal is to aim the bubbles in such a way that they will touch identically colored ones. When such bubbles form a group of three or more, they pop and disappear from the screen.</plot>

    <plot>It seems like all gaming systems must have their Baseball game, as early as 1978! Indeed the RCA Studio II, the Fairchild Channel F, the Bally Astrocade and the Atari VCS all had their Baseball game![CR]he controls are similar to other Baseball games. The outfielders are moved with the joystick, though you can't move them after the ball is pitched. They're spaced a little oddly, so there's usually a gap in right field that the computer player manages to hit to more often than not. To pitch, you send the ball with the fire button and control its path with the joystick. To bat you simply press the fire button.[CR]The Bally's players are animated better, so if I had to rank this one by graphics, I'd place it as better than the Fairchild's version but not as good as the Bally's, based on overall look and player animations. Control-wise the Bally outfielders had a better range of motion, without the gap that the APF players can't seem to fill. At bat, it seems harder to get a hit on the APF than it does on the Bally and I don't feel I have the same control over where the ball is hit. Pitching is pretty similar in that you've got a lot of control over the ball after you "throw" it and it is fun to try to fake out the person at bat with wildly curving balls that they swing at anyway.[CR]You can play with a friend or against the computer.</plot>

    <plot>Super Robot Wars GC is the first and only Nintendo GameCube Super Robot Wars title. The basic premise of the game is that the plot, settings, characters, and other mechanics consist of essentially mixing and combining the like of Gundam, Mazinger, Getter Robo, Zettai Muteki Raijin-Oh, and many other mecha-based anime and manga series into one universe. The Super Robot Wars series has existed for a fairly long time, dating back to the Nintendo Game Boy, and has had many releases since then, across possibly all of the mainstream platforms since then, including the SNES, PS, PS2, GameCube, Game Boy and later iterations, among other platforms. It was ported to the Xbox 360 under the title Super Robot Wars, which had an online mode called Super Robot Competition.</plot>

    <plot>Super Smash Bros. Melee differs from traditional fighting games in that inflicting the most damage does not guarantee victory. Instead, opposing players must force their opponents beyond the boundaries of the stage. Most attacks inflict damage and can, if enough damage is dealt, knock back the enemy. Each character's health is measured by a meter that represents the damage received as a percentage. The higher the percentage value, the farther the player gets knocked back, and the easier they are to knock off the stage. Unlike other games of the same genre, in which moves are entered by button-input combinations, most moves in Super Smash Bros. Melee can be accessed via one-button presses and a joystick direction.</plot>

    <plot>Cowabunga! Take control of your favourite turtle ninjas as you play through the events of the 2007 CGI movie. Leonardo returns from his meditation in South America to find his family in disarray, and crime on the rise in New York. A mysterious figure calling himself the "Nightwatcher" has turned up, and a shadowy rich man named Winters seems to be in cahoots with the remnants of the Foot Clan. Only the Ninja Turtles can clean up the streets![CR]TMNT is an action game, similar to Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time. Play as Leonardo, Michelangelo, Raphael and Donatello, swapping on the fly and using special co-operative moves to help your brothers in battle. Each turtle, being a ninja, can perform moves like double jumping, running along and up walls, gripping onto tiny cracks in the walls, and jumping from wall to wall to scale dizzying heights. Most of the game is spent making your way to the next destination by using your ninja moves to explore New York. Each character also has their own special move: Leo can traverse through walls, Raph can use his Sais to scale particular surfaces, Mikey can use his Nunchucks as helicopters to float for a short period, and Don can pole vault across long gaps with his Bo Staff.[CR]Sometimes, battles will occur - in these situations, you'll be locked in an arena and must battle all your enemies before you can move on. Battling is a simple affair - you can use one button for standard attacks (charge it for a more powerful one), and another button for light attacks that push enemies away. If your fellow turtles are with you, you can also hold down your character swap button for a tandem co-op attack. Some levels will allow you to play as the Nightwatcher - he fights similarly to the Turtles, except that as the more he fights, the more his 'rage' builds, which can cause a devastating surrounding attack when fully charged. The Wii version of the game controls similarly to all other versions, except that gestures are used for attacking instead of button presses.[CR]The basic goal for each level is to get to the end. At the end of each level, you're graded on the following attributes: your speed, your combat, and the amount of coins collected. In levels where you work with your brothers, you'll also be graded on how well you worked together.

    <plot>Cowabunga! Take control of your favourite turtle ninjas as you play through the events of the 2007 CGI movie. Leonardo returns from his meditation in South America to find his family in disarray, and crime on the rise in New York. A mysterious figure calling himself the "Nightwatcher" has turned up, and a shadowy rich man named Winters seems to be in cahoots with the remnants of the Foot Clan. Only the Ninja Turtles can clean up the streets![CR]TMNT is an action game, similar to Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time. Play as Leonardo, Michelangelo, Raphael and Donatello, swapping on the fly and using special co-operative moves to help your brothers in battle. Each turtle, being a ninja, can perform moves like double jumping, running along and up walls, gripping onto tiny cracks in the walls, and jumping from wall to wall to scale dizzying heights. Most of the game is spent making your way to the next destination by using your ninja moves to explore New York. Each character also has their own special move: Leo can traverse through walls, Raph can use his Sais to scale particular surfaces, Mikey can use his Nunchucks as helicopters to float for a short period, and Don can pole vault across long gaps with his Bo Staff.[CR]Sometimes, battles will occur - in these situations, you'll be locked in an arena and must battle all your enemies before you can move on. Battling is a simple affair - you can use one button for standard attacks (charge it for a more powerful one), and another button for light attacks that push enemies away. If your fellow turtles are with you, you can also hold down your character swap button for a tandem co-op attack. Some levels will allow you to play as the Nightwatcher - he fights similarly to the Turtles, except that as the more he fights, the more his 'rage' builds, which can cause a devastating surrounding attack when fully charged. The Wii version of the game controls similarly to all other versions, except that gestures are used for attacking instead of button presses.[CR]The basic goal for each level is to get to the end. At the end of each level, you're graded on the following attributes: your speed, your combat, and the amount of coins collected. In levels where you work with your brothers, you'll also be graded on how well you worked together. Succeed in a these attributes, and you'll earn turtle coins which can be used to purchase unlockables. If you get an A Rank or higher in a level, you'll also unlock a Challenge Map, which can be played to earn even more turtle coins. Finally, once you've played any level at least once, turtle coins will appear in hard-to-reach spots for you to collect.</plot>

    <plot>TMNT: Mutant Melee (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Melee in PAL territories) is a 2005 fighting video game developed by Konami. It is based on the 2003 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles series.[CR]Gameplay[edit][CR]Most of the characters from the series are playable in this game, including the protagonist four Turtles and Splinter, April O'Neil, and Casey Jones. The Shredder and Hun, two of the show's main antagonists, are also playable, as well as varying types of Foot Ninja. Other characters, such as Traximus, and Sleeg are also playable.[CR]In the game there are 4 game modes: Last Man Standing, Knock Out, King of the Hill, and Keep Away. In Last Man Standing, the goal is to be the last living player. Knock Out challenges the player to KO the most players in a set time or to reach a set amount of KO first. King of the Hill's goal is to get to a set amount of points before the other players. To gain points, players must stand in the light beam that moves to set places on the map. Finally, the goal of Keep Away is to carry a chest to gain points. While carrying the chest, players are unable to attack. The carrier must run away from the other players because being hit will cause the carrier to drop the chest.</plot>

Skilled in the art of boomerang combat, TY not only survives the dangerous Australian Outback, he runs, jumps, swims, and glides through it. As TY, you'll encounter more than 50 wild characters based on real-life indigenous animals of Australia. Not all of them are nice--so give your enemies a taste of eight different boomerangs. When you're not busy in combat, you'll solve puzzles, collect items, and participate in races.</plot>

    <year>1989</year>
    <plot>Yo! After being treated like garbage by the Ninja Turtles, Shredder has trained a new, more merciless breed of Foot Soldiers to inflict his revenge: A clan of over 700 Taekwondo turtle terminators who have once again captured April O'Neil to use as turtle bait. Fortunately you don't have to face these freaks of torture alone. For the first time ever, two dudes or dudettes can join forces and double-team Shredder, kicking shell while covering each others tails. But to survive you've gotta fight through 8 action-packed arcade levels, including Vinnie's Valet "Stalking" Lot and the Soho Sewer System, plus two new never-before-seen shell-squashing stages! Each of these deathtraps is reinforced by lethal electro zappers, laser beams, freezer burners or enemies such as Scorpion Robots, Stone Warriors and Baxter Stockman. Shredder has also hired the all-powerful Tora and Shogun, two alien bounty hunters who have never known defeat. Even though Master Splinter has prepared the turtles well for battle, teaching them radical new attack moves, it doesn't mean this war to save April and turtlekind will be a piece of cake or even a slice of pizza. Because with the forces of revenge on his side and the bounty boys in town, it's payback time for Shredder!</plot>

    <plot>Yo! After being treated like garbage by the Ninja Turtles, Shredder has trained a new, more merciless breed of Foot Soldiers to inflict his revenge: A clan of over 700 Taekwondo turtle terminators who have once again captured April O'Neil to use as turtle bait. Fortunately you don't have to face these freaks of torture alone. For the first time ever, two dudes or dudettes can join forces and double-team Shredder, kicking shell while covering each others tails. But to survive you've gotta fight through 8 action-packed arcade levels, including Vinnie's Valet "Stalking" Lot and the Soho Sewer System, plus two new never-before-seen shell-squashing stages! Each of these deathtraps is reinforced by lethal electro zappers, laser beams, freezer burners or enemies such as Scorpion Robots, Stone Warriors and Baxter Stockman. Shredder has also hired the all-powerful Tora and Shogun, two alien bounty hunters who have never known defeat. Even though Master Splinter has prepared the turtles well for battle, teaching them radical new attack moves, it doesn't mean this war to save April and turtlekind will be a piece of cake or even a slice of pizza. Because with the forces of revenge on his side and the bounty boys in town, it's payback time for Shredder!</plot>

    <plot>TMNT3 puts more of a focus on teamwork, character development and control than any other console Turtles game to date. Gamers can play as their favorite Turtle alone or with up to three friends, earning experience points along the way as they slash and bash Foot Ninjas and powerful, well-known bosses from the TMNT universe. These experience points allow players to improve and evolve their Turtles' traits and abilities for more varied, powerful attacks and moves. The Ninja Scroll System is another new feature on TMMT3. Being able to select which ninja scrolls to use allows the Turtles to use various special abilities strategically. Cooperative play lies at the heart of TMNT3 and gamers who team up with friends for multiplayer action are rewarded with exclusive features such as Cooperative Attack for even more shell shocking damage to enemies. The effect of this attack changes depending on the number of players working together (between 2-4 players). For even greater control, TMNT3 features a new combat system called the Target Attack system that lets gamers play more instinctively and strategically. With the Target Attack system, players will be able to lock onto specific enemies and block, dodge or counter attack accordingly for smoother and more maneuverable combat. Story Mode can be played with 1-4 players. Even when you have less than 4 players to play, the other Turtles will be at your side, controlled through AI. All the Turtles can participate in Cooperative Attack to beat enemies and players can give commands to the AI.</plot>

    <plot>The TimeSplitters are an evil race dwelling outside of time and space. Roused from an ancient sleep, they cross the threshold from their shadowy dimension, ripping through the fabric of time itself to make humanity history. Can we unite against a common enemy? Or will we be condemned forever to a realm ruled under the shadow of the TimeSplitters. In the 1-player game you travel from time to time to collect different artifacts before the Timesplitters can. The multiplayer game is 4-player Deathmatch with the option of adding several bots.</plot>

    <plot>The game is segmented into a series of fifteen separate missions, each of which begins with a briefing and a news report concerning the outcome of the previously completed assignment. The player must prepare his men in advance by deciding how to organize them into teams and how they'll be outfitted, specifying everything from the type of body armor they will wear to the ammunition they will fire. Each member of Rainbow has different strengths and weaknesses which must be exploited depending on the nature of the mission. If during a mission any member happens to be killed they will be permanently removed from the roster and replaced with a less qualified stand-in. The option exists to load an alternate set of pre-defined arrangements for each individual mission, circumventing this stage of planning.</plot>

    <plot>The game is segmented into a series of fifteen separate missions, each of which begins with a briefing and a news report concerning the outcome of the previously completed assignment. The player must prepare his men in advance by deciding how to organize them into teams and how they'll be outfitted, specifying everything from the type of body armor they will wear to the ammunition they will fire. Each member of Rainbow has different strengths and weaknesses which must be exploited depending on the nature of the mission. If during a mission any member happens to be killed they will be permanently removed from the roster and replaced with a less qualified stand-in. The option exists to load an alternate set of pre-defined arrangements for each individual mission, circumventing this stage of planning.</plot>

    <plot>Third-person stealth action game, puts you in control of Sam Fisher, an ex-CIA, ex-Navy SEAL who's called into service at the request of the National Security Agency. The NSA has commissioned a new sub-agency called Third Echelon to gather intelligence in the colder, more cruel geopolitical landscape of 2004. Third Echelon has the latitude to deploy Splinter Cells -- such as Sam -- highly trained operatives who are granted the "Fifth Freedom" to do whatever it takes to protect the country. The downside is that if Sam's ever caught doing dirt, the US government will disavow any knowledge of his existence. The gadget-laden action game features 14 missions and 13 hi-tech weapons.</plot>

    <plot>Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Double Agent is an action-adventure stealth video game, developed and published by Ubisoft. The series, endorsed by American author Tom Clancy, follows the character Sam Fisher, an agent employed by a black-ops division of the National Security Agency, dubbed Third Echelon. Double Agent was released for the GameCube, PlayStation 2, Xbox and Xbox 360 in October 2006. The Wii and Microsoft Windows versions were released in November 2006. A PlayStation 3 version was released in March 2007. Originally the game was set for a March 2006 release, but Ubisoft moved the release date to October 2006 in order to have more development time. Ubisoft then released their fiscal quarter results for Q1 2006 and announced that Double Agent would be put back at least one month in order to boost Q3 2006 income.[CR]There are two separate versions of Double Agent. One version was made by Ubisoft Shanghai, who developed Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow and was released on the Xbox 360, Microsoft Windows, and PlayStation 3. The other version was made by Ubisoft Montreal (Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell and Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory) and was released for the Xbox, PlayStation 2, Nintendo GameCube and Nintendo Wii. The Ubisoft Shanghai version features a completely custom engine while the Ubisoft Montreal version plays more like the classic Splinter Cell games. The games share the same general plot but feature different storylines, plot twists, and levels. They do however, share the same background music, a few cut scenes and all voice actors. The version for mobile phones was developed by Gameloft.</plot>

Throughout the game you must help your friends by getting skate pieces for Skate Ranch.[CR]The game marks the third reinvention of the series, with Pro Skater being the first, and Underground being the second. It comes with brand new features like the ability to change your personal appearance in game, as well as the ability to get off of the skateboard and use a BMX. For the first time all of levels are strung together into one big environment, which gets rid of loading times and menu selection.[CR]Old features were also kept like Create-a-park, which dates back to the Pro Skater series. Missions are still acquired by going up to random people or friends and accepting the mission they want you to run.[CR]The game also includes a multiplayer mode and co-op for up to 2 players for added replay value.</plot>

    <plot>The Tom Cruise film featured an F-14 Tomcat plane, and this licensed game recreates this. Viewed from the cockpit in full 3D, the game is a straight head-to-head duel, against another player or the computer. You are armed with missiles (while put you in control of a small target zone, which must remain over your opponent for 3 seconds), flares and cannons (which overheat when overused)- use these more wisely than your opponent. Pay attention to speed and altitude too. The computer has 3 planes to throw at you, of which the last is the toughest, while each player in a 2-player game also has 3 'lives'.</plot>

    <plot>Players take control of one of two warring nations, Red Star and Blue Moon, as they seek to establish turn-based dominance over each other. After selecting which stage to start the game and setting which, if either, player will be controlled by a person, the Red Star army is given the first turn. The objective in each stage is to either conquer the enemy's headquarters or destroy all remaining enemy units in one turn. During each turn, the player is given a certain amount of funds which can be used to build units in factories, seaports, and airports in their command, as well as cities near their headquarters. Each unit has their own specialty and abilities, with ten land units (including two foot soldier units), four air units, and two sea units. Some units use firepower against the enemy, while others provide support to allies. Only foot soldier units are capable of conquering cities, which are used to repair or refuel damaged units and gain more funds. There are 15 maps available at the start of the game, with two secret ending maps dependent on the player's nation when playing against the computer.</plot>

    <plot>The Champions League, where the player leads one team to the Final in the Ataturk Olympic Stadium in Istanbul, in the quest to succeed FC Porto as European Champions, is one of the available modes, but not the most important. That honour goes to the "The Season" mode, where the player starts by creating his managing avatar, and then proceeds to a a series of 50 missions, with the first being a close last-week match against a Champions League spot rival, proceeding with a buyout of the club and increased expectations, and (hopefully) closing with the Champions League final. This mode also allows players to unlock additional features such as balls, a stadium and special exhibition modes by fulfilling objectives set by the club president during the season, some of them crucial matches (which can result in a sacking if failed), others simply a matter of balancing the squad. Other modes include the usual friendlies, "home and away" (a two-legged friendly), scenarios (where the player can create situations such as a defending a 1-0 nil for 45 minutes while two man down) and practice.</plot>

    <plot>The Champions League, where the player leads one team to the Final in the Ataturk Olympic Stadium in Istanbul, in the quest to succeed FC Porto as European Champions, is one of the available modes, but not the most important. That honour goes to the "The Season" mode, where the player starts by creating his managing avatar, and then proceeds to a a series of 50 missions, with the first being a close last-week match against a Champions League spot rival, proceeding with a buyout of the club and increased expectations, and (hopefully) closing with the Champions League final. This mode also allows players to unlock additional features such as balls, a stadium and special exhibition modes by fulfilling objectives set by the club president during the season, some of them crucial matches (which can result in a sacking if failed), others simply a matter of balancing the squad. Other modes include the usual friendlies, "home and away" (a two-legged friendly), scenarios (where the player can create situations such as a defending a 1-0 nil for 45 minutes while two man down) and practice.</plot>

    <plot>UFC: Tapout is a video game in the fighting genre based upon the Ultimate Fighting Championship. The game was released in North America on February 28, 2002 for the Xbox console.[CR]Tapout was published by Crave Entertainment and developed by DreamFactory. The subtitle Tapout refers to a fighter tapping his hand indicating that he has submitted to a submission hold. A tapout, along with a knockout, judge's decision, and referee stoppage, is one of the ways of ending a UFC bout.[CR]The game features many of UFC's top stars including Matt Hughes, Chuck Liddell, Mark Coleman, Frank Shamrock, and Tito Ortiz. Competitions can take place in several modes such as exhibition, tournament, arcade, and championship mode. Several fighters throughout the game are unlockable such as two female competitors and celebrity Ice-T.[CR]UFC: Tapout received generally lukewarm reviews from critics. A sequel to this game entitled UFC: Tapout 2 was released in 2003. Other than an updated roster, the game is very similar to the first Tapout and received similar reviews. Tapout 2 was published by TDK Mediactive. Both games have an ESRB rating of T for Teen.</plot>

The 'Peperami Animal' was launched in 1993 advertising with the slogan 'It's a bit of an animal'.[CR]This surreal adventure takes place in the town of Snackopolis, where tension between cookies, vegetables and other snack-creatures is on the rise. Just before the mayoral election, the current mayor and top candidate Dr. Pepereinstein is kidnapped while he is cloning Peperami. In addition, the cloning device was tampered with, with horrible results. As Peperami, a walking and talking sausage, you investigate and seek to rescue the mayor and to clean up the mess left from the cloning.[CR]You explore over 130 hand painted locations around the city, talk to other snacks to find clues, solve puzzles, and fight the bad guys. The game is a traditional point and click adventure with the exception of two DOOM-style first-person shooter sections at the end of the game.</plot>

    <plot>Dominating the exciting world of Theme Park ownership is your goal in this strategy game from Bullfrog. The first task is to set up your rides within the available land, structuring convenient paths and queues and ideally leaving some space for bigger rides once they become available, and include some lakes and trees to increase the park's allure. Rides range from Teacups and Haunted Houses to the biggest most elaborate roller-coaster you can design, and water rides that loop around other rides.[CR]Shops must also be included, so that the visitors can buy food, drinks and souvenirs - the cunning player will combine salt, sugar and caffeine settings to maximize consumer interest. Staff must be hired to keep everything running smoothly, and they will only work for what they consider a fair rate of pay.[CR]You are competing against other Theme Parks, so don't let them get an advantage over you - monitor your success in attracting customers and financial viability closely using the supplied statistics pages. More important, ensure that research is adequately funded to produce new rides.[CR]It can be played in three modes - Sandbox level lets you concentrate on the park design elements, while Sim and Full add more strategic features.</plot>

    <plot>Freestyle Street Soccer focuses on 10 individual gangs--all based on the different styles, fashions, and cultures found in the concrete jungle. These teams fiercely compete for each other's turf with the ultimate goal to gain control of the whole city. You'll join the battle as one of 40 players with individual catchphrases, plus trick, combo, and special moves. As you conquer the challenges in five game modes, remember--on the streets, it's just as important to look cool as it is to score goals.</plot>

    <plot>Joe is no ordinary man and Viewtiful Joe is no ordinary game. Capcom's new superhero action game mixes funky cartoon-style visuals with classic side-scrolling gameplay and introduces the world's quirkiest million dollar action hero. More than just any ordinary dude, Joe must transform into the ultimate superhero. It's up to you to activate the correct view mode like "slow" or "zoom in" in order to clobber your enemies with beautiful style. You can also speed up or slow down your visual effects for even more "viewtiful" moves. Viewtiful Joe mixes an innovative viewpoint with an amazing stunt-filled action movie universe.</plot>

    <plot>The goal of the game is to shoot at targets, while carefully avoiding running out of bullets. Three rows of targets scroll across the screen in alternating directions; these include rabbits, ducks, owls, and bonus items. If a duck target crosses the bottom row without being shot, it will come to life and begin flying down toward the player. Any ducks that reach the bottom of the screen in this manner will eat some of the player's bullets. Objects also periodically appear among the targets that will give the player extra bullets or points when hit. A spinning wheel with eight pipes sits above the rows of moving targets; these pipes and all targets must be shot in order to complete the round.[CR]At the end of each round, the player receives bonus points for all bullets remaining in his supply. He then plays a bonus round, where a large white bear with a target walks across the screen. Each time the bear is shot, it rears up for a second, then begins walking more quickly in the other direction. The object is to shoot the bear as many times as possible until it escapes off the screen. Following the bonus round, the next wave begins. Later bonus rounds add more bears to the screen.[CR]In higher levels, there are more duck targets and fewer extra bullet targets, putting a premium on accurate shooting. The game ends when the player runs out of bullets.</plot>

Game modes include Road to World Cup, Tournament and Versus.[CR]Road to World Cup allows you to choose from the 64 teams, editing their names, stats, uniforms and more before taking them onto the world stage to compete for the World Cup. The road is long, however, as you must use your available points (equivalent to money) to schedule matches with other international teams, purchase venues, pay for travel expenses for out of town tours and training camps, and more importantly, pay for your players and coaching staff.[CR]The other modes of play allow you to simply join in a arcade football match. You choose the team and a CPU opponant, then play for the points in tournament, or pride in versus and practise modes.</plot>

    <plot>The game consists of a single-elimination knock-out tournament with 16 teams (like in the knock-out stage of the FIFA World Cup), with each match lasting two minutes by default, plus injury time and, if the match ends in a draw, one extra minute of sudden death. If the draw persists, penalty shootouts are used to decide the winner. In the console versions and Virtua Striker 4, matches are divided in two halves of one and a half minute each, with substitutions allowed at half time. Virtua Striker 4 also adds a qualifying match, which grants access to the tournament proper if won.[CR]The game operates with three buttons: one for passing (which is also used for sliding tackles when not in possession of the ball), one for long balls (which automatically crosses if the player is running parallel to the box) and one for shots, which can be charged or, if the player is on the receiving end of a cross, tapped for a header or volley finish. The Start button is used to alternate between each team's two available tactical schemes before and during a match (except for the first game, which had no such mechanic, as each team came with its own preset formation) - while each has an offensive or defensive mentality, the formation of choice before kick-off will influence in which formation the team will adopt a neutral mentality. Virtua Striker 4 also added a sprint button.</plot>

Many of the mini-games featured in the handheld original have been converted for four-player competition on the console. Gamers strive to be the quickest teeth-brushers, the most precise nose pickers, the best free-throwers, the most accurate apple shooters, the most skillful paper-airplane pilots, and the victors in countless other quick contests that take no more than a few seconds to complete.[CR]As in the GBA original, a wide variety of activities combine with a simple, unifying theme, for an experience designed to appeal instantly to anyone who played video games in the days before 3D graphics and complicated storylines. Half the fun is in not knowing which five-second challenge will pop up next, or what the player will be required to do in it. Even when players aren't in control of the active character, some of the mini-games allow them to participate in a more passive fashion, adding to the group-oriented strategy.</plot>

    <plot>Barbarian blends the intensity of a fighting game with the deep storytelling of a role-playing game. Choose one from 10 different characters--all fighting to remove the evil Zuagg from power--and battle through several gameplay modes. In Quest mode, every choice you make and every battle you win or lose has consequences on the rest of the story. As you progress through 10 fighting arenas, you can enhance your character's speed, physical and magical attacks, and ability to lift objects and other characters. Follow your character's journey, upgrade it, save it on your memory card, and then challenge your friends in Combat mode with your very own personalized character.</plot>

    <plot>Wreckless: The Yakuza Missions casts the player as either two members of the Hong Kong Police Force or as a pair of spies who must put a stop to the Yakuza (Japanese Mafia) stranglehold of Hong Kong. There are ten missions per side, for a total of twenty missions. Missions range from destroying cars to picking up documents to rescuing people.[CR]The game sports a real-time damage modeling system, so cars will break apart depending on how much they are damaged. Hoods and doors will pop loose and fly off, glass will shatter and break, license plates will get knocked loose and swing from side to side before finally falling off. The environment can be damaged as well, with street carts falling to pieces and neon signs exploding into a shower of sparks. Each side starts with a default car, but both gain access to exclusive new rides as they complete missions or by finding and touching hidden cars during levels.</plot>

    <plot>Wreckless: The Yakuza Missions casts the player as either two members of the Hong Kong Police Force or as a pair of spies who must put a stop to the Yakuza (Japanese Mafia) stranglehold of Hong Kong. There are ten missions per side, for a total of twenty missions. Missions range from destroying cars to picking up documents to rescuing people.[CR]The game sports a real-time damage modeling system, so cars will break apart depending on how much they are damaged. Hoods and doors will pop loose and fly off, glass will shatter and break, license plates will get knocked loose and swing from side to side before finally falling off. The environment can be damaged as well, with street carts falling to pieces and neon signs exploding into a shower of sparks. Each side starts with a default car, but both gain access to exclusive new rides as they complete missions or by finding and touching hidden cars during levels.</plot>

    <plot>X-Men: The Official Game acts as a story bridge between the second and third X-Men movies. In the game, the player takes control of Wolverine, Iceman and Nightcrawler, as they deal with the aftermath of the incident at Alkali Lake. The heroes return to Alkali Lake to recover two stolen Cerebro parts, and find out that an unknown organization is doing a salvage operation on the base. What they uncover reveals to be a threat to all mutants...[CR]The three playable characters have distinct fighting abilities. Wolverine fights from a fixed third-person view; the player essentially has to "button mash" his way through hordes of soldiers and classic X-Men villains as Sabretooth and Lady Deathstrike. Iceman can fly; his abilities are widely used when he traverses the ice bridge to fly out and save places such as a nuclear power plant and the Statue of Liberty. As Nightcrawler, the player views the world from a free third-person perspective; he possesses a teleportation ability, which allows him to drop on his enemies while getting the missing Cerebro parts and saving the Brooklyn Bridge from Mirror Man.</plot>

The game retains the action elements of the previous titles: as before, opponents will try to sabotage the race, and the player-controlled character is able to answer them with his own arsenal of weapons.[CR]Unlike the previous installments, weapons cannot be picked up on the road: the player has to purchase them with the money earned after a successful race. All weapons now deplete the player's weapon bar with each shot. Another change is the absence of the "nitro" boosts utilized in the previous entries; they have been replaced with a turbo system, where using the boost drains energy from the player character's shields.</plot>

    <plot>The Zelda Game and Watch (model number ZL-65) is a multi-screen Game and Watch system developed by Nintendo and released in North America in 1989. Its gameplay was heavily inspired by Nintendo Entertainment System game Zelda II: Adventure of Link, and it featured an original story described on the manual. [CR]Unlike the other LCD games, this was made by Nintendo and appeared on a Nintendo platform. The handheld console would be Nintendo's penultimate release before the release of the Game Boy (the last being Mario The Juggler). [CR]Gameplay:[CR]Players control Link and fight through labyrinth chambers on the Game and Watch's lower screen. In the labyrinth chambers, Link faces Poe-like Ghosts, up to four Stalfoses, and a Moblin-like Goblin mini-boss. Stalfoses and Ghosts cannot be defeated and must be dodged and blocked with the shield respectively. The Goblin must be killed in order to complete the lower-screen labyrinth.[5] Once the Labyrinth is complete, stairs appear and the action shifts to the Dragon's Lair in the upper screen. Here Link battles a dragon on the right hand side of the screen while avoiding its fire and tail attacks. The left hand side of the screen displays the dungeon map and items such as the Tomahawk item--unique to this game--that Link gains while fighting the dragon. Upon defeating the dragon, the game starts again with quicker enemies and retaining the player's high score. This Game and Watch game also features a continue button that allows players to continue the game in the event of the player's death.</plot>

    <plot>Toki, known in Japan as JuJu Densetsu (JuJuChuan Shuo ?) is a 1989 shoot 'em up platformer arcade game, or a "run and gun" developed and published in Japan by TAD Corporation and published in North America by Fabtek. It features elements of tongue-in-cheek humor combined with the action. The player takes control of an enchanted ape who must battle hordes of jungle monsters with energy balls from his mouth (described humorously as "monkey-spit" or "monkey-vomit" by some gamers). The ultimate goal is to destroy the evil wizard who cast a spell on you; therefore transforming yourself from an ape back into a human, and rescuing the kidnapped princess. The game was ported to several video game consoles and home computers.</plot>
