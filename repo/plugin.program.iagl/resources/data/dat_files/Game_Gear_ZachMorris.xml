		<emu_comment>No Intro Game Gear list.  Filtered to remove duplicates, betas, etc.[CR]The Sega Game Gear is an 8-bit handheld game console released by Sega. The Game Gear primarily competed with Nintendo's Game Boy, the Atari Lynx and NEC's TurboExpress. The handheld shares much of its hardware with the Sega Master System and is able to play its own titles as well as those of the Master System, the latter being made possible by the use of an adapter. Containing a full-color backlit screen with a landscape format, Sega positioned the Game Gear as a technologically superior handheld to the Game Boy.[CR]Developer:  Sega[CR]Manufacturer:  Sega[CR]Media:  ROM cartridge[CR]CPU:  Zilog Z80 clocked at 3.5MHz[CR]Memory:  8kB RAM, 16kB VRAM[CR]Display:  160x144 pixel resolution, 4096-color palette[CR]Sound:  Texas Instruments SN76489[CR]Dimensions:  209 x 111 x 37 mm</emu_comment>

Familiar mechanics such as precisely timed jumping, avoiding spikes, pouncing atop the heads of enemies are all featured.Gomez in The Addams Family.[CR]The Addams Family game follows Gomez Addams, as he searches the Addams' residence (which has been taken over by Gomez's evil lawyer, Tully Alford), for his missing family members. There are several stages in the game accessible through different doors in the main hall (there are also hidden doors that can lead to rooms with a good amount of pickups, or even some that can serve as short cuts), each housing an imprisoned member of Gomez's family. To free his family, Gomez must traverse each stage and defeat a boss.[CR]Pickups include: hearts which increase health; a sword that is lost after taking damage; a rapid firing marble like item, a power up that is also lost after taking damage; and yellow dollar signs, one hundred of which will award the player with an extra life.[CR]Once Gomez frees Uncle Fester, Wednesday, Pugsley, and Grandmama, he can then enter the final area of the game to save his wife, Morticia.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The Adventures of Batman &amp; Robin is a variety of different games. The SNES version is a traditional side-scrolling action game whereas the Genesis version is a two player game that plays like a shooter. But instead of using guns, Batman and Robin uses Batarangs and other projectiles to take out their foes. The Sega CD version consists of just Batmobile levels.[CR]The SNES Version[CR]The Adventures of Batman &amp; Robin was originally titled "Batman: The Animated Series" after the show. But since the show got a name change, the game was delayed and then renamed to what it is called today and Robin was added as an NPC. Despite his appearance in the game, Robin is not a playable character. Each level is based off episodes of the series and shared dialogue and moments from them. Before each level Batman must choose from a variety of different weapons to take with him.[CR]The SNES version had 8 levels:Level 1: Amused to Death[CR]The Joker and Harley Quinn broadcast a television message to Batman inviting him to meet them at The Joker's Funhouse.[CR]Boss: The Joker[CR]Based on the episode(s): Christmas with the Joker, Be A ClownLevel title cardLevel 2: No Green Peace[CR]Bizarre things are occurring at the forest in Gotham City suburban district there's only one person who would do such a thing. In this level, Batman refuses to use his fists, Bat Stars and Bat Explosives since there are only female enemies.[CR]Boss: Poison Ivy[CR]Based on the episode(s): Pretty Poison, Eternal YouthLevel title cardLevel 3: Fowl Play[CR]There has been a break-in at the Gotham City Museum and it's up to Batman &amp; Robin to find the person responsible for this. Unfortunately, Robin is not a playable character in this level.[CR]Boss: Penguin[CR]Based on the episode(s): TBCLevel title cardLevel 4: Tale of the Cat[CR]Batman is doing his nightly routine in the streets of Gotham City when he stumbles upon a familiar cat burglar lurking around.[CR]Boss: Catwoman[CR]Based on the episode(s): The Cat and The Claw part ILevel title cardLevel 5: Trouble in Transit[CR]Two-Face has just robbed a bank and is making his escape.

Instead of using guns Batman and Robin use Batarangs. Levels are swarming with enemies and the player must "shoot" them to defeat them. If they get up close to the player then the heroes will either punch or kick them instead of throwing a Batarang. In some levels the player flies in a Batwing moving from the left to the right shooting down anything in their path. The plot features Mr. Freeze wanting to freeze Gotham . In the process he releases Joker, Two-Face, and Mad Hatter out of Arkham Asylum an attempt to distract Batman and Robin from his intentions. The Genesis version consists of four levels:Happy Birthday to Me!Bosses:Harley's RobotHarley QuinnJokerA Two-Sided StoryBosses:Two Face's AirshipLarge ShipTwo-FaceTea Time!Bosses:Giant CatGiant DollMad-HatterSnow in July?Boss:Mr. Freeze[CR]The Sega CD Version[CR]Pimp my ride![CR]The Sega CD version is a 3D driving game with levels comprising only of driving the Batmobile and Batplane from point A to point B - shooting enemy vehicles along the way. The CD version is well known for having over 16 minutes of original animated footage created purely for the game with no involvement from Warner Bros. Animation. These cutscenes would later be known as 'The Lost Episode' from the animated series. All the principal voice actors from the series like Kevin Conroy, Mark Hamill, Loren Lester, Arleen Sorkin and John Glover reprise their roles. The only thing missing from the source material is the original score by Danny Elfman and Shirley Walker. The game instead used its own "synth rock" style music.Enemies:Poison IvyThe RiddlerHarley QuinnThe JokerRupert ThorneClayface[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level Passwords[CR]Enter passwords.</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR] The player takes the role of a Freedom Fighter who has to destroy five targets, which includes: the Vinsk, teh CB-53 Bomber, El and two cliff fortresses. During each mission the player must battle enemy jets, choppers, submarines, jeeps, parachute bombs and several other different enemies. When the player shoots either the spinning fighters, small flying helicopters or the mines on the final mission, the player will earn a power-up that can then be used to upgrade or downgrade their firepower. The game includes three difficulty settings: Easy, Normal and Hard. The player cannot complete the game if they play on the easy setting.  [CR] Plot[CR]Years ago, an evil militaristic organization called N.A.C developed a huge laser emitter, called "EL". It was capable of gradually destroying the Earth's ozone layer. This, of course, posed a great threat to all life on the planet and cast a shadow of fear that went to the far corners of the Earth. In the year 1999, (where was I when this happened?) the N.A.C began an all-out fight against all the countries in the world. At first, each nations Self-Defense forces valiantly stood their ground against the most formidable adversaries, eventually they proved to be no match of the sheer power and size of the enemy. However, just as all seemed lost, the "Freedom Fighters" appeared. They weren't officially attached to any one nation, so they secretly deployed to clash with the unsuspecting enemy forces.[CR]</plot>

		<title_clean>Aladdin</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR] The lamp level [CR]There were three different video game versions of Disney's Aladdin, two released within weeks of one another. One was developed and published by Virgin Interactive and the other by Capcom. It is the Capcom version that made an appearance on the SNES - and much later the Game Boy Advance - while the Virgin Interactive game was released initially for the Sega Genesis and later ported to the NES, Game Boy, Game Boy Color and DOS and Amiga home computers. It is also of note that alongside the official NES game, there were two unofficial ports of the same game and another illegitimate one of Capcom's version.[CR]In both games, the player must guide Aladdin through several locations seen in the 1992 movie of the same name. In the Virgin Interactive game, Aladdin has a sword which he can use to attack enemies, however in the Capcom version the only weapons are apples scattered around the levels which are used temporarily stun guards, who can only be killed if Aladdin jumps on their head.[CR]The third game was made by Sega for the Game Gear and Master System. It follows the plot of the movie more closely than the other two games, and instead of being a straightforward platformer, it plays more like Prince of Persia; most levels have Aladdin solving minor puzzles to progress, rather than defeating enemies and navigating platforms (However, other levels do take place in a running perspective, requiring traditional platformer skills).[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The plot in both titles is taken directly from the film so it may not be new to many players. The story is based on an Arab folktale by the same name from One Thousand and One Nights (Though many aspects have been changed by Disney). Players control a street urchin by the name of Aladdin who meets a young princess named Jasmine. The Grand Vizier Jafar wants Jasmine for his bride and needs Aladdin to get the magic lamp from the Cave of Wonders for him. Things don't work out the way they were supposed to and Aladdin gets stuck with the lamp, as well as three wishes. Then, more things go wrong and eventually a battle between Jafar and Aladdin occurs. Aladdin comes out victorious, frees the genie, and gets engaged to the princess.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the Genesis version of the game scores of 9,8,9 and 8 out of ten. Ed Semrad wrote, "What happened to the Genesis!?! Suddenly, all of the latest titles are some of the best ever seen! This cart has got to be seen to be believed! The animation is absolutely flawless, making it look just like the animated movie -- literally! The slapstick humor of the movie is also retained...".[CR]Danyon Carpenter wrote, "...Aladdin takes many ideas from side-scrollers and turns it into a slapstick game everyone can enjoy. The sound effects are right on the money and the animation has yet to be rivaled. No other game comes close when comparing animation...".[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Cheat Menu[CR]At the title screen-while the words "Press Start Button" are flashing - press the following:[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Cheat Menu[CR]Press 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, and 1 during game play to skip to the next level.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level Passwords[CR]Enter these passwords from the title menu.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level Passwords[CR]Enter the following passwords.</plot>

		<plot>Alien3 is a video game based on the movie sequel of the same name. The plot of the movie picks up directly after the end of Aliens. Ellen Ripley, the main character of the Alien series, is in cryo-sleep aboard the space ship Sulaco. Unfortunately, an alien or two has stowed away on the Sulaco, and wreaked havoc within the ship. Thus, it crash lands on the prison colony planet Fiorina 161. Ripley and the unarmed prisoners have to figure out a way to survive the aliens terrorizing the colony until help arrives.[CR]The game play of the various Alien3 conversions varies from platform to platform. The Genesis Alien3 game is a side-scrolling action game with large maze-like levels. In each level, you have to rescue all the trapped prisoners and then make your way to the exit, all while surviving multiple alien attacks.[CR]https://www.mobygames.com/game/game-gear/alien_[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Stage Select[CR]When the "Start" and "Configure" options appear at the title screen, press the following before the Alien 3 logo fades out:[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Extra Ammo[CR]Get a high score and enter your name as CHEAT to get extra ammo.</plot>

		<title_clean>Andre Agassi Tennis</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR] Andre Agassi stars in his first tennis game that came out for the  SMS,  SNES,  Genesis and  Game Gear. This tennis game does not have any other notable tennis stars to note but features many game play options like practice, tournament and skins tournament that makes this game unique from other tennis games before it.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game uses the same rules of tennis that is played today. A player must get over 40 points to win a game, 6 games to win a set and win 2 sets out of the 3 to finish the full match. The game allows the player to play either singles or doubles in either tournament or skins tournament. They can even select what court surface to play on like grass, clay, hard or indoor. After the player selects a type of game, they will have a choice of any of these players: Andre AgassiTiger BallRon PepperDon MattBob "Bit" ChinGeorge KingCarol ArkCassie Nova[CR]Each athlete has attributes for them like speed, strength (backhand, forehand and server) and accuracy (backhand, forehand and server) which makes the choice of athlete an interesting one. Once an athlete has been selected, two main buttons will be used during the match. The (A) button will help the player lob the ball in the air while the (B) button will help them hit the ball normally (this is for the Genesis version). When the ball is served or hit on the player's side of the court, they must get as close as possible to the ball and hit it back. The player can use either a backhand or forehand depending on their position before hitting the ball. They can move around the court and position themselves using the D-pad.[CR][B]Game Modes:[/B][CR]Practice Mode - This mode allows the player to select an athlete and have a ball machine feed them balls so the player can practice their game. There are no winner or losers in this mode.Tournament Mode - Like a career mode, the player selects an athlete to play as in a tournament and face many opponents before facing the final match and winning it all.Skins Tournament Mode - This is a tournament that places money down on each hit that takes place during the match. Whoever wins a point will receive the total amount of money in the pot. The pot starts with $10 and doubles each hit from there on in.[CR]</plot>

		<title_clean>Arch Rivals</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR]Arch Rivals was an alternative take on basketball that was the major arcade basketball title before NBA Jam. The main selling point of the game was the ability to punch your opponents during the game as a means of stealing the ball. Your team consisted of one of eight different players:  Blade Hammer Lewis Mohawk Moose Reggie Tyrone Vinnie  All of the players had their own specific advantages. Mohawk was the best fighter while Lewis was the best shooter. Some later editions of the game did have some NBA teams in it, such as the Phoenix Suns as selectable characters. And the backboard shattering dunks popularized in the game were carried over to its more influential follow-up, NBA Jam.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>The continent of Tyramus has lived in peace for almost a century, thanks to the four elemental crystals of the kingdom of Arliel. However, peace is threatened by the invading armies of the Jyn Empire, led by Emperor Grym, who wants to use the four crystals to rule over Tyramus. Fortunately, Princess Iris can escape with one of the crystals and now the player has to protect her and the crystal and somehow find a way to drive back the hordes of Jyn.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] in Crystal Warriors is quite similar to Shining Force. The player fights in turn-based battles controlling different characters like fighters, healers, rangers and mages, all with different strengths and skills. Whenever two units engage in battle, they enter a duel mode lasting for up to two turns. In this mode the player can choose between four commands: "battle" (attack), "retreat", "spell" and "monster". While the first three commands are quite self-explanatory, the "monster" command is interesting. Whenever a non-human enemy is defeated, it can be tamed and be used in battles. While most monsters do not have many HP they can serve as good attackers for physically weak characters or take some hits in order to protect his master.[CR]In-between battles the player can visit towns to rest, buy weapons and spells or recruit new party members.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Sound Test[CR]Before turning on the system, press and hold the 1 Button, 2 Button, and the Start Button.  Turn on the Game Gear and release the buttons.  At the title screen, press and hold the Up directional key and the Start button.</plot>

Although the main setting of each level is the same to both characters (forests, caves, deserts, underwater stages, waterfalls and such) the level design for each one may vary. In two player mode (Master System version), players will take turns playing as Ast?rix and Obelix. Both characters jump (by pressing button 2), punch enemies and break blocks (by pressing button 1). Ast?rix can run can run (by pressing and holding button 1 while moving) and double jump (by pressing 2 in the middle of a jump). Ob?lix is stronger and can break several bricks in a row when jumping over them (pressing 1 while jumping), and can also slide down hills (by pressing down at them).[CR]Ast?rix can get some potions (thrown by pressing up and 1), which can break rocks, kill or shrink enemies. Obelix can get miniature menhirs which can be thrown (by pressing up and 1) against enemies. Both characters can also get bones throughout the game, granting access to bonus stages where the player controls Dogmatix. Some levels also involve minor puzzle solving, like pushing switches or moving rock blocks.[CR]https://www.mobygames.com/game/game-gear/astrix-and-the-secret-mission[CR]</plot>

		<title_clean>Ax Battler - A Legend of Golden Axe</title_clean>
		<plot>The legendary Golden Axe has been stolen by an army of evil warriors. The king called a young warrior to take it back. His name was... Ax Battler![CR]Ax Battler: A Legend of Golden Axe is an action/adventure RPG which puts the player in the role of Ax Battler, the Barbarian from previous Golden Axe games in search for the Golden Axe. The gameplay feels much like Zelda II: The Adventure of Link, with Ax moving around in a top-down perspective, changing to a side scrolling view when fighting enemies or entering caves.[CR]The battles are random and Ax won't see the enemies coming. If he's hit during a battle, the battle will end instantly and he'll be sent back to the overworld map. If he prevails, he gets magic vases from the enemies. Magic vases are the game's currency and are also used to cast spells, just like in the other Golden Axe games, but instead of having only the "Earth" magic, he also has the "Thunder" and "Fire" magics. Ax can also use special attacks to fight his enemies, learned at "dojos" found in each city.[CR]Instead of battery backed RAM, this game uses passwords as a mean to save games. At each town the player enters, he'll find a place to learn a new password which, when entered, allows him to continue from the very point it was learned.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level Passwords[CR]Enter the following passwords.</plot>

		<plot>[CR]Ayrton Senna himself helped develop this game.[CR]Made by Sega in 1992, this game was released on all of Sega's consoles including the Genesis, Master System and Game Gear.[CR]The most fleshed out version was the Genesis one. In it one could race through two main modes. The first was Senna GP which players could race on a Senna designed track, and the second was the world championship mode.[CR]The world championship mode had two settings: Beginner and Master. The Beginner mode was a straightforward drivers championship, where the driver at the end of the season with the most points was the winner.[CR]The Master mode included the concept of teams and rival drivers. In this mode, players were put in a team with the objective of advancing to better teams until eventually taking Senna's place at the top of the food chain.Meet Nigel Mansell's unlicensed cousin[CR]Players could challenge rival drivers and replace them in the team if they won.[CR]The teams were arranged in 5 tiers with the master himself in a separate class altogether. The game was unlicensed, so all the rival drivers and teams were likenesses of real ones. Even Senna's team in the game was an original team called "Madonna" as opposed to his real team at the time, McClaren.[CR]The tracks were relatively close to their real life counterparts, and Senna advised developers about track characteristics. They even followed the order of the real life Formula 1 calendar. Each track had some unique background elements such as a city or forest. Some tracks even featured rain on random occasions.[CR]Even with all these realistic elements, the games handling could best be described as arcadey. This was characteristic of console racing games of the time. More realistic racing games could be found on the PC, but for many Genesis owners, Ayrton Senna's Super Monaco GP II brought Formula 1 home.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]Upon release, Electronic Gaming Monthly issued the following scores: 6,8,6,5 adding, "...this is a game that only a dyed-in-the-wool racer will love. The first SMGP set new standards in driving simulations and, while this version smooths out the rough edges, it does not break any new ground".[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level Passwords[CR]Enter the passwords given.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level Passwords[CR]Enter these on the password screen.</plot>

		<plot>The Minister approaches the King to tell him that his only daughter, the Princess, wants a new pet. But the King says she already has too many, and she can't take care of so many animals. Thus the Minister purposes a contest of skill and daring to select the Royal Zookeeper. Master Piggy then sends his pupil, Polly, to participate in the contest.[CR]Baku Baku Animal is a variation on the very often copied Tetris type of game. The game has three different play modes: practice, normal and hard. It also can be played by two players against each other (except for the Master System version).[CR]The objective is to pair animal heads with their respective food. If a rabbit head comes falling, you must make it fall on a pile of carrot tiles, dog heads with bones, panda heads with bamboos and monkey heads with bananas. There is a bonus item, the "BB coin", which will appear from times to times, and remove piled tiles from the playfield. Removed tiles will be sent to the opponent's playfield all at once, increasing the difficulty of the task. Polly will face several contestants, and she'll win when her opponents get their playfield piled to the top.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Final Level Passwords[CR]Enter:</plot>

Loosely based on the 1995 film of the same name, up to two players team up as either Batman or his sidekick Robin as they set out to foil the plans of criminal Two-Face and puzzler The Riddler. Unlike traditional beat 'em up games, Batman Forever combines 2D platforming with fighting game controls (in similar vein to Mortal Kombat). The game features a non-linear level structure (with puzzles) and fully-digitized actors.[CR]The game was ported to the Game Gear, Game Boy, and PC by Probe. Another Acclaim-published beat 'em up based on the same movie was released for arcades in 1996 under the same name. Also sporting fully-digitized actors, it was later released for the PlayStation and Saturn as Batman Forever: The Arcade Game.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Players can choose between playing as the Caped Crusader or his sidekick, Robin or can even add a second controller for co-operative play.[CR]The fighting aspect of the game resembles the engine for the "Mortal Kombat" games, right down to the motion-captured characters and the basic fighting moves (uppercut, high and low punch, etc).[CR]Players can also choose what gadgets to bring along in each level, which each gadget having it's own pro's and cons. Arguably, the most useful gadget is the grappling hook, which gets the character to higher parts of the level that couldn't be reached before.[CR]The game includes many secrets, such as different hidden gadgets and multiple "riddles" from The Riddler himself.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Cheat Mode[CR]Enter the following code at the skill screen to access level selection, invincibility, and all weapons options.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Cheat Mode[CR]Enter this code while on the difficulty screen.</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]As the video game market slowly turned towards the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and Sega Genesis, Rare Ltd released this game which can be considered one of the best looking games on the NES. The game begins aboard the space ship &#8216;The Vulture&#8217; where Battletoads Rash, Zitz, and Pimple (all disgustingly named after skin diseases) are escorting Princess Angelica back to her home planet. Pimple and Princess Angelica go cruisin&#8217; and get intercepted by the game&#8217;s villain, the Dark Queen of Ragnarok. Both are kidnapped and taken back to Ragnarok. The Professor, captain of The Vulture, takes Rash and Zitz to &#8216;rumble&#8217; with the Dark Queen on Ragnarok and &#8216;get the Princess and Pimple back.&#8217; The remainder of the game takes place on planet Ragnarok where Rash and Zitz set off to save their friend Pimple and Princess Angelica.Gameplay[CR]While the first level is a typical 2D beat em up similar to Double Dragon, other levels have a variety of gameplay styles, including rappelling down a pit, riding speed bikes and surfboards, navigating a level on a unicycle-like vehicle that can ride up walls and on the ceiling, etc. The main objective of each level is to defeat as many enemies and overcome as many obstacles as possible and reach the endpoint. General strategy is to memorize these obstacles[CR]and rely on quick reflexes to reach the end. The entire game rounds up to two difficult levels where the Toads climb a tower and, at the end, reach the Dark Queen.[CR]The most memorable aspect of this game is the absurd difficulty. Not only did it employ a decent amount of memorization but reflexes had to be fast, even for veteran gamers. Another memorable moment for this game would be the humorous way enemies were finished off, be it by using a football helmet or sprouting horns and ramming the enemy off screen.[CR]When the game was released on the Game Boy Electronic Gaming Monthly awarded it the scores of 8,8,8,7 saying, "...one of the best Game Boy games I've ever played". The Game Boy version had the same basic theme found in the NES adventure, with the toads using all of the same fighting moves. The levels and bosses however were entirely original.[CR]</plot>

		<title_clean>Bubble Bobble</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Bubble Bobble is an arcade game created by Taito. The arcade version of the game was released in 1986, with console and computer releases coming soon after. The game is a co-op platformer starring twin dinosaurs named Bub and Bob as they travel through one hundred one-screen levels. Bubble Bobble became very popular, inspiring a number of sequels and spin-offs.[CR]It was one of the first games to feature two-player cooperative play and multiple endings.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]An early level[CR]Bubble Bobble follows Bub and Bob as they venture through 100 different levels. The dinosaurs have the ability to blow bubbles, which they capture enemies within. Once an enemy is captured inside of a bubble, Bub and Bob must pop the bubble to defeat the enemy. Once defeated, the enemy will fly off and turn into a tasty treat, which can be snagged by Bub and Bob for points. The object of each level is to eliminate every foe. When one foe remains, they will become enraged and move faster. If Bub and Bob take too long, ghost whales will come and destroy the dinosaurs. Each level consists of one screen with a complex series of blocks. Bub and Bob can jump through thin layers of blocks, as can their enemies. There are two holes on the top of the screen and two holes on the bottom. All characters can travel through these to the opposite side of the screen.[CR]There is a large number of enemies, all of which have different traits. The most basic of these enemies is a small, square robot that runs around. Others include witches that create boulders,A level shaped like a character[CR]whales that bounce around, helicopter blobs, and more. As the game progresses, more enemy types appear in all sorts of locations, and the challenge comes in figuring out how to take out each type of enemy. Some offensive items that will commonly appear are waterfalls and lightning bolts. Waterfalls will sweep up any characters they pass and dump them down the hole. Lightning bubbles will fly horizontally across the screen, shocking anything they touch. There are also powerups that create short bonus rounds, such as one that spreads large cookies over the screen, and the players must gather them before the time runs out.[CR]Powerups[CR]There are a large variety of powerups to collect in the game, and some must be used to safely complete a level. Each one arrives randomly, and many are quite rare.Yellow Sweetie: Bubble firing speed increasesPurple Sweetie: Long range bubblesBlue Sweetie: Increase bubble firing speed across screenRed Ring: Points increase per bubble firedPurple Ring: Added points every jump performedBlue Ring: Added points for every pixel travelled.Red Shoe: Faster movementClock: Timer freezesOrange Umbrella: Skip 3 levelsRed Umbrella: Skip 5 levelsPurple Umbrella: Skip 7 levelsBlue Cross: Flood screen with water killing all enemiesRed Cross: Shoot fireballs instead of bubblesYellow Cross: Lightning flash kills all enemiesBlue Lamp: Gives effect of all three ringsYellow Lamp: Gives effect of all three SweetiesRed Lamp: Gives effect off both Blue and Yellow LampsPurple Lamp: Kills all enemiesBomb: Kills all enemiesBook: Kills all enemiesDiamond Pendant: Stars flood the screen killing all enemiesLightning Potion: Fires Lightning bolts instead of bubblesRed Bracelet: Causes E.X.T.E.N.D Bubbles to appear at next available opportunityWhite Bracket: A Ball bounces around the stage killing all enemiesFlashing Heart: Enemies freeze, dinosaur becomes invincibleCrystal Ball: Causes Item spawn frequency to increaseDungeon Door With Flames: Secret room with hidden messageWooden Dungeon Door: Only Appears on Lv 50.

In Japan, the Gamest Awards gave it the Silver Award for being one of the four best games of 1986, along with Taito's own Arkanoid, Sega's Fantasy Zone and Tecmo's Rygar (Gamest, The Best Game 2: Gamest Mook Vol. 112, pages 6-26). In Europe, Bubble Bobble was the most popular arcade game on Euromax's nationwide UK charts during the period of May-July 1987, above Capcom's 1942 at second place.[CR]The arcade game also received positive reviews from European critics. In the November 1986 issue of Computer and Video Games, Clare Edgeley described it as an "addictive" game that "sounds quite easy", letting "you in gently", before "the nasties get faster, more of them appear and they're harder to catch." She stated the "continue play facility" is "a great help and allows you to see much more of the game" if "you've got the cash", and the "two player option is more fun as" both "can act as a team" to "clear the screens quickly" and "get to the harder levels." She also noted "the sense of competition is heightened as the player who grabs the fruit gets the points, regardless of who burst the bubbles", which "fast develops into a race against each other." In the April 1987 issue of Crash, Gary Penn described it as a "deceptively simple" arcade game "that proves very addictive and lots of fun to play." He concluded that it was "very compelling" and recommended readers to "Invest a few coins as soon as you can."Home Versions[CR]The home console and computer ports were also well received. Mean Machines gave the Game Boy port of the game a score of 91%, noting that while some changes had been made, the game played identical to the original arcade port and "provides much addiction and challenge". The Spectrum version was voted number 58 in the Your Sinclair Readers' Top 100 Games of All Time. GamesRadar ranked it the 24th best NES game ever made. The staff praised its advancements over other platform games of its time and its use of multiple endings.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Access All Levels[CR]Enter the password  to gain access to all 200 levels.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Access All Levels[CR]Enter the password YONGDEOK to start with 9 lives instead of 5.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Unlock The Endings[CR]The game has 3 endings, depending on the following:</plot>

		<title_clean>Captain America and the Avengers</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR] Arcade Title Screen[CR]Captain America and the Avengers is an 1991 Arcade brawler from Data East, later ported to the NES, SNES, Genesis, Game Gear and Game Boy. Data East handled the Genesis version themselves, though the SNES, Game Boy and Game Gear versions were licensed out to Mindscape who contracted Realtime Associates the develop the games. The NES game plays a little differently, more of a standard platformer game, and doesn't have as many playable characters.[CR]Taking control of one of the classic (1980s-90s) Marvel Avengers, the player battles their way through five levels in order to prevent Red Skull from carrying out his nefarious plan. The player(s), as either Captain America, Iron Man, Vision, or Hawkeye, fights their way through cities, space, and even underwater. Occasionally other Avengers show up to help the team: Quicksilver by bringing health, Wonderman with a hover craft (for the two Avengers not capable of flight), Namor with a diving suit, and The Wasp becomes an auxiliary attack.[CR]Marvel villains Whirlwind, Grim Reaper, Mandarin, The Juggernaut, Crossbones, and, of course, Red Skull all make appearances as well as quite a few others (including what looks like a Sentinel from the X-Men universe).[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Each hero has a similar set of abilities. There are two jump attacks (one if the player taps jump and attack, the other for holding jump and then pressing attack), they can dash at enemies to knock them down, a projectile (laser weapons for The Vision and Iron Man, arrows for Hawkeye, and Captain America's shield), and a series of punches and kicks followed by a throw.Iron Man is so lazy.[CR]Every couple of levels the brawling action is broken up with side-scrolling shooter sequences. There are three of these: one in space, one underwater, and one in a war-torn city.[CR]The levels are two miscellaneous cities, underwater, a secret underwater base, and the moon.[CR]</plot>

		<title_clean>Castle of Illusion Starring Mickey Mouse</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Castle of Illusion starring Mickey Mouse (known in Japan as I Love Mickey Mouse: Great Mysterious Castle Adventure) is a 2D sidescrolling platformer developed and published by Sega for the Sega Genesis on November 20, 1990. It is the first in a series of Sega-produced games starring Disney mascot Mickey Mouse (known as the "Illusion" series).[CR]As Mickey, players must embark on an adventure through the evil and mysterious Castle of Illusion to rescue Minnie Mouse from the evil witch Mizrabel, who plans to steal Minnie's youth. To do so, he must find the seven Gems of the Rainbow (guarded by the Masters of Illusion) hidden within the magical worlds (including an enchanted forest and a toy-box) scattered throughout the castle. The game's Practice difficulty changes the goal, in which Mickey must find three gems (collected by completing a particular level from the game's first three worlds) that would make Mizrabel see beauty in herself.[CR]The game was later remade for the Sega Master System and Sega Game Gear in 1990-1991, featuring redesigned levels and simplified graphics (as well as different enemies, items, and bosses), as well as completely changing one of Mickey's attacking mechanics from flinging apples (and other items previously collected) to picking up and hurling larger solid objects found throughout each level (such as indestructible barrels, which double as a puzzle mechanic).[CR]The original game was bundled with QuackShot starring Donald Duck in Japan on October 15, 1998 as part of the Sega Ages series of game collections for the Sega Saturn. It also received a full remake on September 3, 2013 (almost 23 years after the original game's release) as a downloadable title for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and PC by Sega Studios Australia (under supervision of the original game's director, Emiko Yamamoto) featuring a variety of new gameplay mechanics (such as transitioning between 2D and 3D platforming) and a spoken narrator. The original game was released for the PlayStation 3 (for owners who pre-purchased the remake after August 20, 2013).[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]As Mickey Mouse travels through these wacky and dangerous worlds, he will have to defeat a variety of enemies to advance. To attack enemies, Mickey can stomp on them, or fling apples and marbles at them, which can be collected throughout the game. Mickey Mouse can also collect icons that restore health, add extra lives, or boost your score.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Chuck Rock is a prehistoric-themed platformer starring the eponymous caveman Chuck on a quest to rescue his wife from a jealous rival. Chuck's main form of attack is a stomach bump with a limited range, but he is also able to take advantage of rocks littering the stages to attack enemies from afar. He can also use these rocks to create platforms to higher areas he cannot reach by jumping normally. While most dinosaurs are hostile some, like the wading brachiosaurs and certain pteranodons, will assist Chuck by taking him to new areas of the stage.[CR]UK developers Core Design originally created Chuck Rock for the Atari ST and Amiga computer platforms, and it was subsequently published on many home consoles of the era by Sony Imagesoft and Virgin Interactive in Europe and the US. It is perhaps best remembered for its rock n' roll theme tune. It was followed up with a direct sequel starring Chuck's son Chuck Jr., called Chuck Rock II: Son of Chuck, and BC Racers, a spin-off cart racer game.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Infinite Health Password[CR]Under Start Game, choose Password.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Infinite Health Password[CR]Enter the passwords given.</plot>

		<title_clean>Chuck Rock II - Son of Chuck</title_clean>
		<plot>The story in this Chuck Rock game takes up a little while after the end of the first game.  As you may remember, Chuck Rock had to rescue his girl, Ophelia from the bad dude Gary Gritter.  Well, he was successful in his efforts, and now Chuck and Ophelia are married.  Eventually, they have a son, named Junior. Chuck works in a factory, where he develops great skill at carving automobiles out of stone. A rival manufacturer becomes jealous of Chuck's abilities and kidnaps him.  Now it is up to Junior to rescue his dad![CR]The gameplay in this sequel is similar to the first game, but with some minor differences since you are playing as Junior, rather than Chuck. This is a side-scrolling platform game with occasional rock-moving puzzles thrown in. Unlike Chuck, Junior carries a club that gives his attacks further reach.</plot>

The Sega CD version also includes a fast-paced stage where Gabe tries to outrun an avalanche sledding down a hill, as well as cutscenes taken from the movie. The 8-bit versions (Game Boy, Game Gear, NES) are platformer action games.[CR]Cliffhanger won the award for Worst Movie-To-Game of 1994 by EGM magazine.[CR]</plot>

The length of the innings can be determined to choose from five, to seven, to the full nine innings and when batting the screen splits up to see both first and third base to keep an eye on the baserunners.</plot>

		<plot>Columns is loosely derived from Tetris, as it involves arranging falling blocks in such a way as to clear them. However, in columns they are groups of 3 same-size but varying color blocks, which must be arranged into sequences of 3 or more, either horizontally, vertically or diagonally. Sequences of 4 or 5 count for double or triple points, and diagonal sequences score the most. The real trick is to set up 'combos' - where one line causes other blocks to drop so as to create other lines.[CR]As well as the normal game mode, there is also a 'flash' mode, in which the aim is simply to remove a particular block from the base of the pre-formed pile of bricks. The difficulty of this can be determined by increasing the number of complete rows which are already in place.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alternate ending[CR]Start a new game in flash mode, a height of nine, and the level of difficulty set to normal. Quit the game after the demonstration mode to see a different ending sequence.</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]It's Spot![CR]Cool Spot is a 2D side-scrolling platformer developed and published by Virgin for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and Sega Genesis in 1993. It is the second game to star Spot, the tiny anthropomorphic red dot and then-mascot of the 7 Up brand of soft drinks. As one of the many Spots, players must guide it around the world, rescuing other Spots from their unexplained imprisonment in cages.[CR]The game was later released in 1995 for the Sega Game Gear, Game Boy, Sega Master System (Europe only), Amiga (Europe only), and PC (Europe only). It later received a sequel, titled Spot Goes To Hollywood, for Genesis, Saturn, and PlayStation.[CR]While the game was a licensed promotion with the soft drink, European versions removed the branding (since the European version of 7 Up did not have Spot as its mascot).[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Spot can jump and attack by firing soda bubbles which can be shot in all directions and while jumping. Cool Spot can also cling to and climb on various things.[CR]In each level, the player must rescue other cool spots, who look exactly alike, from cages at the end of that level. The end of the level is not necessarily the point at the far right of the level map. In order to do so, the player is required to collect a certain number of "spots" that change (usually increase) as the game progresses. "Spots" are placed across the level in large quantities, and are the game's substitute for items such as Sonic the Hedgehog's gold rings (these were often used in this style of game, mostly for points). A player's health is monitored by a humorous Cool Spot face that gradually bends forward and will eventually fall from its position as damage occurs. Damage is taken by touching enemies, their projectiles, or certain level obstacles. Each level is played with a time limit. If the clock hits zero, a life is lost regardless of the player's health.[CR]The game has no save feature but does use checkpoints in the form of flagpoles. Once passed, the flag raises and a trumpet sounds. If a player loses a life after reaching a checkpoint, the player can restart further in the game.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Cheat Menu[CR]Choose "Options" from the main menu, then put the cursor next to the "Music" option and press the following:</plot>

		<plot>Linus had crash landed on a distant planet called Earth, and made his way back home again. Trouble is, no one believes his tale of the planet he discovered! Your job is to help Linus make his way back to planet Earth so he can take some pictures to convince his friends. Gameplay consists of two parts, an adventure and arcade action. In adventure mode you can explore lands, find objects, and talk to people. Sentences can be constructed by using the pointer to select actions or objects on the screen (This is similar to the interface LucasArts used in games such as Maniac Mansion.) To reach many new locations involves the action mode, where you will need to cross treacherous landscapes and evade dangerous creatures. This portion resembles a side scrolling platform game. Once you've cleared an action sequence, you will not need to do so again if you decide to revisit a location. Whenever you wish you can receive a password allowing you to continue the game later from the same point.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Area passwords[CR]Go to the "Password" screen at the main menu to enter these passwords</plot>

		<plot>The continent of Tyramus has lived in peace for almost a century, thanks to the four elemental crystals of the kingdom of Arliel. However, peace is threatened by the invading armies of the Jyn Empire, led by Emperor Grym, who wants to use the four crystals to rule over Tyramus. Fortunately, Princess Iris can escape with one of the crystals and now the player has to protect her and the crystal and somehow find a way to drive back the hordes of Jyn.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] in Crystal Warriors is quite similar to Shining Force. The player fights in turn-based battles controlling different characters like fighters, healers, rangers and mages, all with different strengths and skills. Whenever two units engage in battle, they enter a duel mode lasting for up to two turns. In this mode the player can choose between four commands: "battle" (attack), "retreat", "spell" and "monster". While the first three commands are quite self-explanatory, the "monster" command is interesting. Whenever a non-human enemy is defeated, it can be tamed and be used in battles. While most monsters do not have many HP they can serve as good attackers for physically weak characters or take some hits in order to protect his master.[CR]In-between battles the player can visit towns to rest, buy weapons and spells or recruit new party members.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Sound Test[CR]Before turning on the system, press and hold the 1 Button, 2 Button, and the Start Button.  Turn on the Game Gear and release the buttons.  At the title screen, press and hold the Up directional key and the Start button.</plot>

		<title_clean>Double Dragon</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Originally released in 1987 in arcades, Double Dragon is an early brawler game credited, in part, for the popularity of the beat-em-up genre during the 1980s and 1990s. The game was first developed by Technos Japan Corporation and published by Taito Corporation, and has since been ported to numerous consoles, computers, handhelds, and even cellular phones. The game also spawned the popular Double Dragon franchise, which has had five games in the main franchise, as well as two Neo-Geo fighting games.[CR]After the initial arcade release, the game has been ported to a variety of systems, including the Nintendo Entertainment System, Sega Master System, ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64 (two different versions), PC, Atari ST, Amiga, Atari 2600, Atari 7800, Game Boy, Sega Genesis, Atari Lynx, Xbox Live Arcade, Zeebo, iPhone and Android. Every release differs in some aspect or another, particularly the Game Gear, NES, Game Boy, and Atari 2600 versions.[CR]The game's popularity led to several sequels (with the latest iteration released in 2003), a cartoon series (which ran for two seasons), a comic book (published by Marvel, ran for six issues), and even a movie (which was released in 1994, inspired by the television cartoon). The cartoon and its resulting movie release were both loosely based on the NES version of the game, whereas Jimmy Lee is initially a villain (having been raised by the antagonist of the franchise, the Shadow Master).[CR]The game's soundtrack was composed by Kazunaka Yamane, and was released in an album on February 21, 1988. The soundtrack, titled Original Sound of Double Dragon, features all nine tracks from the arcade version of the game. These tracks are all arranged versions of the songs found in the game.Gameplay[CR]Double Dragon follows Billy Lee and Jimmy Lee (incorrectly named Hammer and Spike in the promotional materials with the American version of the arcade game), two martial artists whose love interest, Marian, is kidnapped by a gang called the Black Warriors. Playing in cooperative mode triggers a different ending, where Billy and Jimmy must fight each other for the affection of Marian.The Black Warriors kidnapping Marian in the Arcade version[CR]A three button beat-em-up, there are three base moves in Double Dragon; punching, kicking, and jumping. Various combinations of these moves produce other moves, such as head butts, elbow smashes, jumping kicks, backwards kicks, or the signature Double Dragon hair grab (in which the character grabs the enemy by the hair, making them vulnerable to attacks and throws).[CR]In addition to moves, Double Dragon has a variety of weapons that can be carried from fight to fight (this was altered in the NES version, where weapons could only be used if the enemy it was taken from is still alive). There are four weapons; baseball bats, whips (neither of which are incredibly effective), knives (which are arguably the most powerful weapons in the game), and explosives (timed explosives which can be thrown).[CR]Other Versions[CR]NES VersionOnly two enemies can be on-screen simultaneously in NES version[CR]Released in 1988 (and later on the Wii Virtual Console in 2008), the NES version of Double Dragon was among the better received ports of the game. Published by Tradewest, Double Dragon on the NES has many differences from the arcade game on which it is based, beyond the obvious decrease in graphical and sound quality. The plot was altered, due to the exclusion of a two-player cooperative mode. Rather than fighting the leader of the Shadow Warriors, Billy Lee faces off against his brother, Jimmy Lee.[CR]Other than the single player story, there are a few other modes that implement two player gameplay. Mode A allows players to do a tag-team style game, alternating who is playing after each death. Mode B is a one-on-one tournament fighting game, where players can choose to fight either computer controlled opponents or player controlled characters.The two player fighting mode in NES version[CR]The game also implemented an upgrade system, where players earn hearts for dispatching certain amounts of enemies. These hearts upgrade the character's abilities, allowing for more complicated moves such as backwards elbowing and face punching. In addition to moves, there are a variety of weapons available, ranging from baseball bats to whips (as well as ranging in damage dealt, and subsequently usefulness).[CR]There are many other differences found in the NES version, some due to general technical limitations. For example, only two enemies can be onscreen simultaneously due to the NES's abilities. Naturally, the stage design deviates from what was found in the original arcade version, including new areas, expanded sections, and completely new levels.Master System VersionSega Master System home console port of Double Dragon[CR]After the NES version was released, Sega brought the game to their 8-bit platform as well. Due to the Sega Master System's more powerful hardware, the Master System version has better graphics (with more colors), more enemies on-screen, and modes and levels that are very similar to the arcade version.[CR]Unlike the NES version of Double Dragon, the Sega Master System version retains the two-player cooperative mode found in the original arcade version. Although it doesn't include the head-to-head versus mode found in the NES game, Double Dragon on the Sega Master System does have one other feature not found in the NES or arcade versions; an unlimited amount of continues (except for the final level).Mega Drive/Genesis Version[CR]In 1992, Double Dragon was ported to the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis. This game was developed by Ballistic, and is very similar to the arcade release. Double Dragon on the Sega Genesis was criticized for one key aspect; its control. The game, according to fans and critics, makes it incredibly difficult to hit enemies, with small hit boxes and sloppy movement.Handheld VersionsThe Game Gear version only features Billy Lee as a playable character[CR]The game has had three different handheld ports; Game Boy, Sega Game Gear, and Atari Lynx. The first of these three versions was released in 1990. The Game Boy version of Double Dragon is heavily influenced by the NES game, with similar level design, enemies, and overall graphical style.[CR]The Game Boy version varies on one key aspect from the NES Double Dragon; it does not include the heart system found in this game. Every move is accessible from the start. In some areas, portions of stages were removed completely for the Game Boy port, particularly some platforming segments of the final stage. Additionally, every character in the two player fighting mode was removed except for Billy Lee and Jimmy Lee.[CR]On the Game Gear, Double Dragon was significantly different from other versions of the game. Subtitled "The Revenge of Billy Lee" in Europe, this game centers around the murder of Jimmy Lee, and Billy Lee's quest of vengeance against the Dragon Clan. Other than this, the game was largely a different game, with altered stage design, different weapons (i.e. guns), and the lack of any modes beyond a single player story mode.[CR]With large sprites, the Atari Lynx version is another recreation of the original arcade game. Giving only a small view of the stage, the game was criticized due to the fact that enemy and character sprites take up nearly three fourths of the Lynx's screen size. The Atari Lynx version also includes a practice mode, which allows players to fight a varying amount of enemies to learn the controls and moves of the game.[CR]In 2003 the game received an enhanced remake for the Game Boy Advance in the form of Double Dragon Advance, which added several new features including cutscenes, additional levels, and new moves.Smartphone VersionSmartphone version[CR]In 2011 a smartphone version of Double Dragon was released on both iPhone and Android. Rather than a straight port, this version adds several features, some of which originated in the Game Boy Advance remake. In addition to the Lee brothers, players can unlock 24 playable characters for use in any mode.Other Versions[CR]Like the sequels to Double Dragon, Binary Designs worked on computer ports to create a variety of versions of the game. Additionally, a second Commodore 64 port was created by Ocean Software, and differed in many ways from the previous Commodore 64 port. While all of the games naturally differ from the arcade game on which they are based, there are several relevant details relating to the ports.[CR]The ZX Spectrum version was incredibly different when it came to graphical style. Due to an attempt at the detail of the arcade version, this version had character and enemy sprites which were transparent other than the black outlines. This, combined with an attempt at some detailed color, caused the game to run very slowly.Both of the Atari versions of the game were created by Activision[CR]Both of the Commodore 64 ports were very close in style, attempting to emulate the gameplay of the arcade release (the first even included a two player mode, almost unheard of among the computer ports). A major difference for the first version was a complete lack of sound, other than the sound effects created by punching and kicking. The second version lacked a two player mode, although it is considered by Double Dragon fans to be a slightly better port.[CR]Also released for the Atari 2600 and Atari 7800, these two ports were handled by Activision. The 2600 version of the game naturally cut much of the game's content; with redone sound and graphics to fit the platform's capabilities, removed enemy sprites, cut weapons, and a shorter story mode (although there is still a two player cooperative mode, as well as a two player versus mode). The 7800 version was improved graphically and sound-wise, although it removes the versus mode.SoundtrackOpening (Double Dragon)The City Slums (The Black Warriors Arrive)The Industrial Area (The Great Fray)After the BattleSetting Off (A New Battle)The WoodsThe Giant Abobo AppearsThe Hideout (Willy the Nemesis)Ending (Reunion With Marian)[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]Data East's Bad Dudes advertisement.Two Amstrad CPC ports of Double Dragon were created. One for the CPC 6128 hardware, which was very well-received and released almost exclusively in France, and another version created for the CPC 464 which was universally panned.The more well-received version of Double Dragon on the Amstrad CPC actually had more in common with the Atari ST and Amiga versions.An advertising campaign from Data East around the release of Bad Dudes stated that, "Bad Dudes Makes Double Dragon Pale by Comparison."Most versions of Double Dragon are infamous for their glitches and exploits, such as suicidal enemies, weapons that can be carried to future stages, frozen sprites, incorrect graphics, and even walking up walls or in the air.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Unlimited ammunition[CR]Take any weapon from level 1 and fire it. Quickly collect it again when it drops after running out of ammunition. Fire it and collect it again when it drops to have unlimited ammunition for that weapon.</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine (Dr. Eggman no Mean Bean Machine in the Japanese version of Sonic Mega Collection) is a competitive puzzle game developed by Compile and published by Sega primarily for the Sega Genesis, with ports made for the Sega Master System and Sega Game Gear. The game is also included in several compilations, such as Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection for the Playstation 3 and Xbox 360. The Genesis version was not released in Japan until 2000, where a PC port of the title was included in "Sega Archives from USA vol. 2"; the Game Gear version was first available to Japanese audiences in Sonic Adventure DX.[CR]Mean Bean Machine is, in essence, a reskinned version of the original Puyo Puyo. Though a more direct English translation of Puyo Puyo's Game Gear port titled "Puzlow Kids" was developed, the decision was ultimately made to change the game's aesthetics; allegedly, this was due to the belief that Westerners wouldn't accept a game featuring a little girl as the protagonist. The characters from Compile's Madou Monogatari series were replaced with characters from The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog, a cartoon series based on the Sonic franchise.[CR]More than a year later, Puyo Puyo's Super Famicom port was reskinned with a Kirby theme and released as Kirby's Avalanche.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Colored beans fall from the top of the screen and must be cleared by connecting four or more beans of the same color. By doing so, the player generates Refugee beans that are sent to the opponent. Refugee beans, once they fall onto the opponent's field, cannot be matched with any other beans; instead, they are removed by clearing an adjacent set of colored beans. The first player that cannot bring more beans into their field loses.[CR]In the game's Scenario mode, the player competes in one-on-one duels with Dr. Robotnik's robot underlings in order to save the bean creatures from being turned into robots. They are faced in the following order:ArmsFranklyHumptyCoconutsDavy SprocketSkweelDynamightGrounderSpikeSir F-Fuzzy LogikDragon BreathScratchDr. Robotnik[CR]Exercise Mode lets players to match beans until they lose, while Vs. Mode allows two players to go head-to-head. The Game Gear version includes Puzzle Mode, which presents the player with several challenges.[CR]Changes from Puyo Puyo[CR]Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine's gameplay is nearly identical to Puyo Puyo, right down to the AI behavior of each opponent. However, Mean Bean Machine removes the Beginner course that was present in Puyo Puyo. A new password feature is included that allows players to continue their progress.[CR]Mean Bean Machine uses several audio and visual assets from Puyo Puyo. Carbuncle remains in the game; he is renamed "Has Bean" and given an all-new backstory. The battleground is taken from the backdrop of Puyo Puyo's early matches. Several of Mean Bean Machine's music tracks, including the Exercise, Vs, Password, and Ending themes, were either directly taken from Puyo Puyo or remixed from songs featured in the game.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Puzzle Mode Passwords[CR]At the Puzzle Mode screen, select continue and use the following key to input the passwords:[CR]Key:[CR]R = Red[CR]G = Green[CR]B = Blue[CR]Y = Yellow[CR]P = Purple/Pink[CR]W = White (Refugee Beans)[CR]H = Has Bean[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Puzzle Mode Passwords[CR]Enter these passwords after selecting &amp;quot;Continue&amp;quot; to skip ahead to the desired level.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Puzzle Mode Passwords[CR]R = Red Bean[CR]Y = Yellow Bean[CR]G = Green Bean[CR]B = Blue Bean[CR]P = Purple Bean[CR]C = Clear (Garbage) Bean[CR]H = Has Bean (the little orange fellow)[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Sound Test[CR]Go to Scenario Mode go to continue and put in Yellow Bean, Red Bean, Blue Bean, Has Bean</plot>

The game revolves around fights from the film's scenes and allows up to 3-player simultaneous cooperative multiplayer.[CR]One unique feature of the game is the method in which it handles continues. Upon losing all three lives, the player is given the opportunity to regain them if they can defeat the final boss with limited health. If the boss defeats the player, the game ends.[CR]The game saw releases for the Sega Genesis and Atari Jaguar in 1994, and the Super Nintendo in 1995. There was also a Sega Master System and Game Gear version of the game that had brawler gameplay rather than being a fighter game. All versions were developed by Virgin Interactive.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>Dragon Crystal is a dungeon crawler with RPG elements, along the lines of classics such as Rogue or Nethack. Without relying on a story, the game throws you into a randomly generated world which you should explore carefully - and most importantly, where you must survive! The complex, maze-like levels reveal their structure only after you cover the corresponding map areas. Your goal in each level is to reach a teleporter which will take you to the next one. There are also a lot of random items scattered around - weapons, armor, money, and food. Money allows you to continue the game if you die, food prevents you from starving. The enemies are visible on screen, and you fight them in a fast-paced turn-based combat, moving around and pressing direction arrows to strike with the equipped weapon. You are always accompanied by an egg which will eventually grow up to be a dragon if you have leveled up enough.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Secret Room.[CR]As soon as you turn on your Game Gear keep pressing Start as fast as you can and when the game starts to load you should start in a secret room filled with weapons and food.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Turbo Speed[CR]To speed up the game at any time, hold down the Start button.

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Earthworm Jim is a side-scroller shooter from Shiny Entertainment and the first game in their Earthworm Jim series. The player assumes the role of the eponymous annelid who is able to shoot in multiple directions with his space blaster, with the ultimate goal of saving the galaxy from Queen Slug-for-a-Butt. The game is best known for its surreal sense of humor and fluid animations.[CR]Earthworm Jim premiered in the October of 1994 for multiple platforms. It saw a sequel the subsequent year: Earthworm Jim 2. In 2010, Earthworm Jim received HD rereleases for modern consoles.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Jim was just an ordinary earthworm who, early one morning, was running from some crows when an indestructible, high-tech super suit (created by the evil genius Professor Monkey-for-a-Head) fell onto him from the sky and, by some wonderful coincidence, the opening of the suit landed on him, and in he went, transforming him into the amazing annelid we've all come to love. Then he took out his gun and exploded the crows who had been chasing him.[CR]The suit had been dropped by a space ship that was being attacked by Psy-Crow, an evil henchman for the Evil Queen Pulsating, Bloated, Festering, Sweaty, Pus-Filled, Malformed Slug-for-a-Butt (or Queen Slug-for-a-Butt in short). The suit was originally designed for her to help her take over the galaxy (...though she probably could never fit in it). Psy-Crow comes to earth to look for the suit but only finds the scorch marks made by the impact of the suit and the exploded crows. He radios Queen Slug-for-a-Butt and they talk about their evil plans for her sister, Princess What's-Her-Name (this game likes its hyphens). Unbeknownst to Psy-Crow, Earthworm Jim was hiding and heard everything. Mustering up some new-found courage, Jim decides to embark on a quest to rescue the beautiful princess.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Jim begins his quest to rescue Princess What's-Her-Name in the game's first level, "New Junk City". There, Jim is introduced to concepts that will be seen throughout most of the course of the game. This includes the use of chains, rope, moss, etc. to climb horizontally, attempting to avoid the peril of landing on spikes, and swinging from hook to hook via Jim's head (using his worminess as a whip). Each level has its own unique gameplay elements to cope with as well. This level in particular includes obstacles such as bouncy piles of tires and zip-lines the player has to use to get Jim to his destination.Jim firing his blaster[CR]Jim will almost immediately encounter baddies at the start of the game. His weapons include a little red blaster and his own earthworm body. Either weapon can be used almost at any time, though on occasion one can be more effective than the other (the gun can stun a crow, but it takes a little longer to kill than by just using the whip, which only takes a single lash. However, the crow must be at the right distance or it's ineffective). Jim's blaster has a full automatic fire rate although it's ammo is capped at 5000. Additional ammo can be picked up throughout the level (the little blaster symbols floating around). Should Jim run out of ammo, the blaster will recharge up to one hundred bullets by itself. There are also Mega Blaster bullets that can be found in a few places in every level. Each Mega Blaster upgrade is good for one shot, delivering a large, devastating beam that destroys any lower enemy with one touch.[CR]Though a platforming game at heart, each level has its own special twists to the formula, breaking up the run-and-gun-and-jump model to deliver on such things as riding hamsters or bungee jumping.[CR]Planets[CR]New Junk CIty[CR]Jim starts off his adventure in this junk yard which he must get through to defeat both Billy the Bin and New Junk City's owner, Chuck.Andy Asteroids?[CR]Jim jumps on his Pocket Rocket and races with Psy-Crow to the end of the level, avoiding asteroids along the way.Psy-Crow[CR]A level that the player only has to complete if Jim loses against Psy-Crow in the Andy Asteroids? level, Jim must have a one on one battle with the mad crow himself to continue.What The Heck?[CR]Planet heck is a strange hell-type planet. This is where Evil the Cat lives and where the player must defeat the likes of lawyers and an un-meltable snowman. The player must complete the level while listening to horrifying elevator music.Down the Tubes[CR]Down the Tubes is an underwater level in which Jim must ride giant hamsters, knock over Bob the Killer GoldFish and complete the infamous tube race.Snot a problem[CR]Major Mucus is out to get Jim! Compete with him in a 3 round battle in which Jim and him both bungee jump down to infested waters and fight by swinging into each other and seeing which cord breaks first.Level 5[CR]The 5th level takes place in Professor Monkey for a head's lab. Watch out though, Jim may just lose his suit, make sure to get it back.Who Turned Out The Lights?[CR]A hidden area found in Level 5 which is completely blacked out besides spotlights, the enemies' eyes and doors.For Pete's Sake[CR]Jim has to escort a cute, tiny puppy named Peter through a level that consists of holes, tentacles and meteor showers. Peter is a small cute timid little dog, but when very frightened he becomes a raging monstrous Hulkish beast.Intestinal Distress[CR]The level takes place in the intestines of a strange creature and at the end of the tunnel Jim must face off against Doc Duodenum. The level is missing from the SNES and PC versions of the game.Buttville[CR]It's all come down to this, Jim is nearing the end of his journey! At the end of stage, prepare to face off against the appropriately named The Evil Queen Pulsating, Bloated, Festering, Sweaty, Stinky, Pus-filled, Malformed, Slug-for-a-Butt.[CR]Avatar Awards[CR]The XBLA version has 2 avatar awards to be earned.Earthworm Jim Suit - Complete a bonus level.Earthworm Jim T-Shirt - (Achievement: Bin Collector) Beat Billy the Bin in New Junk City.[CR][B]Soundtrack:[/B][CR]Earthworm Jim has an awesome soundtrack which consists of -Banjo RaceSnot a ProblemParty TimeFallingWhat the HeckButtsvilleBass MixJunkitBos AnneildPsy-crowDarkworm RagSubmergedYou're the bestEnd theme[CR]</plot>

		<title_clean>Ecco - The Tides of Time</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Ecco: The Tides of Time is a direct follow-up to the 1993 game, Ecco the Dolphin and developed by Novotrade International (now Appaloosa Interactive). The controls of the first game are identical to the second one, as with the difficulty. It includes all new puzzles such as a Scavenger hunt. There are also new powers, one of them includes Ecco changing into different animals such as a jellyfish, a seagull, a shark and a school of fish. With these new additions, many things from the original game came back. The health and air meter are back along with the Glyphs.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The story starts off where the last leaves off: The Vortex Queen is back and follows Ecco back to earth to begin a new hive. Ecco lost his powers from the Ast erite and after he encountered a dolphin with long fins named, Trellia, who was his descendant. She took Ecco to her present which was his future.[CR]In Ecco&#8217;s future, Dolphins evolved with telekinetic powers and the power to fly with helium sacks that were on them. The ocean had a mind of its own with &#8216;skyways&#8217; or waterways that floated trough the skies, which connected other parts of water on the earth. Ecco, who was exploring the future, then found the Asterite.[CR]When talking to the Asterite, it told Ecco that something was wrong. When Ecco used the time machine the world split into two. One which was a joyful future with flying dolphins, the other was a lifeless wasteland which was dried up by the vortex. Even though the Asterite was killed by the Vortex Queen not until later it was explained how it was talking to Ecco. It then sent him back to the present.[CR]Ecco pieced the Asterite together by bringing the globes that made up the creature. The last of the globes had been taken by the Vortex to the future; Ecco had to retrieve them before both he and Asterite could defeat the vortex. They both went to the vortex future that was full of bizarre machines and was much like the last levels of Ecco the Dolphin. Eventually Ecco found the Astrite&#8217;s last two globes and went back to the present.[CR]The Asterite was complete again and Ecco got all of his powers back again.[CR]Ecco then fought the Vortex Queen using the song to destroy her. Though she escaped to the Atlantean time machine, the Asterite told Ecco to destroy it; instead he uses it to and disappears in to the Tides of Time.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level Passwords[CR]At the start of the game, swim left to enter the password screen.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Access the Cheat Menu[CR]To bring up the map screen, use Ecco the dolphin's sonar.

		<title_clean>Ecco the Dolphin</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Ecco the Dolphin (also known as Ecco) is an aquatic side-scrolling action-adventure game developed by Novotrade and published by Sega for the Genesis in Europe (on July 31, 1992), North America (on December 29, 1992), and Japan (on July 30, 1993).Players control a bottlenose dolphin named Ecco (unique to other dolphins for the six star markings on his forehead) as he embarks on a journey through the oceans, trying to figure out the whereabouts of his group (who were sucked up in a mysterious waterspout) while helping fellow dolphins along the way.Along with its unconventional gameplay mechanics (including a dedicated "sing" button for interaction and echolocation), the game is known for its extreme level of difficulty (which would be a staple for the main games of the series) and bizarre plot development (including time travel and alien abductions). It would later spawn a sequel (Ecco: The Tides of Time), a kid-friendly spin-off (Ecco Jr.), and a 3D reboot (Ecco the Dolphin: Defender of the Future).Along with downscaled ports to the Sega Master System and Game Gear, the game was ported to the Sega CD less than a year later. This version (known in Japan as Ecco the Dolphin CD) features a bonus set of levels and new soundtrack (using Redbook audio), and was later ported to the PC in Japan and North America (both in 1996, featuring new high-resolution sprites). The original game was digitally re-released for the Wii (via Virtual Console on November 27, 2006), Xbox 360 (via Xbox Live Arcade on August 15, 2007), PC (via Steam on June 1, 2010), and most iOS devices (on July 22, 2010), and was included in two compilations: Sega Genesis Collection (for the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable), and Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection (for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3).An enhanced port was made for the Nintendo 3DS (as 3D Ecco the Dolphin, part of Sega's 3D Classics remake series) and digitally released on the 3DS eShop on December 12, 2013 (June 26, 2013 in Japan). This version features stereoscopic 3D and a significantly-easier difficulty setting (adding invulnerability and unlimited air).[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Secret Options[CR]During gameplay hold down the START button to bring up the sonar screen.

		<plot>Evander Holyfield's "Real Deal" Boxing is a boxing simulation.  Holyfield is the only licensed boxer, the rest are fictitious. Rather than a fanciful approach like Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!!, the developers went for a more strategic sim. Differently from its Genesis counterpart, the game is played from a first or third person point of view, with the fighters facing each other directly. The player can choose to see the fight from his or from the opponent's point of view ("through his eyes").[CR]Players can either play a quick exhibition match or fight their way through the Career mode, using a created boxer to work their way up the 15-boxer ranking list until they fight Holyfield himself. During character creation, players can choose the fighter's head, color of skin, trunks and hair, physical and mental attributes. The physical attributes are dominant hand, power, speed, recovery and stamina. The mental attributes are style (brawler, dancer, boxer and dodger), killer instinct (low, medium or high) and favorite punches (jabs, straights or hooks aimed at head or torso, one for each hand). Between matches, career mode offers various exercises to assign the boxer to improve his stats.[CR]The players can choose the view mode (normal or reverse), three kinds of control schemes, round length (up to four minutes) and fight length (up to 12 rounds).[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] 18 Wins, 18 Losses[CR]From the Main Menu, choose either Exhibition or Tournament and enter the following.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] 18 Wins, 18 Losses[CR]Enter the password to start with a perfect boxer.</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]F-15 Strike Eagle is an F-15 flight simulator released in 1985 based on real life missions in which the F-15 flew. In the 70&#8217;s and early 80&#8217;s the plane was used during missions in the Middle East and Asia, where it was used to destroy both ground and air targets.[CR]The game was designed by Sid Meier with input from Air Force pilot John W. "Bill" Stealy in a custom language called SidTran. The game was developed by MicroProse and published by Amstrad CPC.[CR]The game was the first part of a trilogy consisting of: F-15 Strike Eagle II  F-15 Strike Eagle III[CR]It was later released again by[CR] ZX Spectrum in 1987 and again, in 1993, on the Game Boy and Game Gear. The game sold more than 1.5 million copies and was awarded Action game of the the Year in the same year it was first published.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game consists of 7 missions which have you fighting against the Libyan air force. The player starts each mission taking off from the[CR] U.S. Navy [CR]Carrier, the USS. Nimitz and flying against Libya and their Russian-built air force.[CR]The game has an arcade mode and 3 difficulty levels and features 3 types of both enemy aircrafts and SAMs. While playing, the pilot will have access to many tools available to modern pilots of the time including:Heads-Up DisplayComputer-assisted targetingAirborne radarGround tracking display mapsChaff and flares[CR]Game Features[CR]The PC version of the game included a method of DRM that required the player to use a decoder wheel to start the game. In later versions, players were able to use "Mission Codes" in order to continue from where they last left off.[CR]The later versions of the game also included a system that allowed the player to earn special rewards, promotions, and various medals for their action in combat.[CR]This was one of the first games to give a player access to chaff and flares. This game was also one of the first games to experiment with wire frame rotation.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>F1 is an Official Formula One Racing Game. There are two modes of play available: "Arcade", "Grand Prix". In both of these modes you complete a certain number of laps (4, 8, or 12) and select which circuit that you want to race on. The circuits include San Marino, France, Britain, Germany, Italy, Portugal, Japan, and Australia. Some circuits are easy, while some are difficult.[CR]There are slight differences between the two modes. For instance, "Arcade" allows you to select the circuit in any order that you like, whereas "Grand Prix" only allows you to fine-tune your car before starting a race. You also need to race a circuit in the order that they appear on the circuit selection screen, but you can skip a track if you want.[CR]https://www.mobygames.com/game/game-gear/formula-one_[CR]</plot>

		<title_clean>Faceball 2000</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The November 1991 issue of Nintendo Power where Faceball 2000 was reviewed.[CR]Faceball 2000 is a first-person shooter developed by Xanth Software and published by Bullet Proof Software for the Game Boy on December 10, 1991 and the Super Nintendo Entertainment System on September 1992. Based on MIDI Maze for the Atari ST, Bullet Proof Software acquired the console publishing rights to the game and released the game in America, Europe and Japan. Players move around a mazed arena as giant floating happy faces, shooting large orbs at enemies to "tag them out". The game was also published for the Game Gear in Japan on December 17, 1993 by Riverhill Software. The Game Boy and Game Gear versions featured local multiplayer via the use of link cables (up to sixteen players on the Game Boy version and two players on the Game Gear version), while the SNES version featured two-player split-screen multiplayer. The four player link cable, which was only packed in with Nintendo&#8217;s F1-race, was necessary for playing the multiplayer.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]An early level of Cyberzone mode.[CR]The game is a first-person shooter, where the player controls a floating head inside of a giant maze. The goal is to eliminate enemy heads by shooting large orbs.[CR]The game features two normal modes and one hidden mode. The first mode is called Cyberzone, in which players must eliminate a set number of opponents before an exit opens up and they can progress to the next level of increasing difficulties. The second mode is called Arena, in which players can choose from a variety of enemies and stages to play on, with the goal of defeating all the enemies. The final, and hardest mode, is called Cyperscape. Instead of having to eliminate a set number of enemies, Cyberscape is much more maze-focused, not having a map for players like other modes. This mode can only be unlocked by entering a code in the player select screen. All modes can be played with two players.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Cheat Menu[CR]Enter the options menu and change the name of the player to [B]CONFIG_SYS[/B] to enter a hidden menu containing a level select, as well as settings for armor, auto-mag count, speed, and lives.</plot>

		<title_clean>Factory Panic</title_clean>
		<plot>Mister Greede, a corrupt tycoon and factory owner, deprives the local citizens of the goods they need and deserve. Thats why you have infiltrated his factory. Now you must manipulate the conveyor belts skillfully to deliver the correct product to the right person waiting outside, but you have only a limited amount of time. Unfortunately, thugs with bats or even guns patrol the factory. Your only weapon against these security guards is a battle cry that temporarily stuns them, but not for too long.[CR]Factory Panic consists of four rounds, and each round consists of eight stages. Before a stage starts, the game tells you how many people are waiting in line and what product they are waiting for. Rounds one and three are played in Switch Mode: step on different switches to rotate associated sections of the conveyor belt. If you get off the switch, the section rotates back to its initial position. One switch may affect more than one section. Since you can only step on one switch at a time, you have to bustle quite a bit in later stages. Rounds two and four are played in Bridge Mode: remove and install small bridges between the belts to control the flow of products.[CR]If a person gets an unwanted product, the time remaining on the timer will decrease. Sometimes, the belt carries special items, e.g. a megaphone that makes your scream attack more powerful, or a weight that can be placed on a switch.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level Passwords[CR]Enter the password for the corresponding level.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Extra Lives[CR]Wait 'till the time reaches 100 to gain extra lives.</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The ship Opa-Opa.[CR]In contrast to the many dark fantasy and sci-fi shooters of its time, Fantasy Zone had bright and colorful pastel environments and enemies that were strange and often abstract looking.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B]-wise it is pretty standard for the genre, but with some twists such as being able to walk on the ground. Upgrades are bought from shops appearing in the world as red balloons with the word shop on them. All the power-ups are temporary, but are powerful enough to be of considerable help when clearing the larger enemies needed to progress to the stage's boss.[CR]Fantasy Zone was originally an Arcade game but was ported to several consoles, not just those made by Sega. The gameplay was mostly the same in all versions, but the graphic quality varied depending on the platform.[CR]The 1986 Sega Master System version is the first SMS game to be released in the standard cartridge format, rather than the Super Card format the system had used up until that point. The cartridge allowed for a lot more memory, and Fantasy Zone was able to exploit this feature. The Famicom version is an official port by Sunsoft but the US NES version is an unlicensed Tengen release. The game was also released on the TurboGrafx-16 as well as appearing in multiple Sega compilations for more powerful systems.Virtual Console[CR]The Master System port of Fantasy Zone was released on the Wii Virtual Console on March 11th 2008 in Japan, April 11th in Europe and April 14th in the US.3D Classics[CR]In March 2014, Sega released a 3D Classics version on the Nintendo 3DS eShop as part of the second run of Sega 3D Classics remastered to be displayed in stereoscopic 3D for the platform.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Cheat Menu[CR]At the title screen, please do the following:[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Cheat Menu[CR]Access the cheat menu (by press Up, Right, Down Left, 1, 2, 1, 2, Start when the words 'push the start button' come onto the title screen) and highlight the Mode option.

		<title_clean>FIFA International Soccer</title_clean>
		<plot>The game that started the best-selling series licensed by football's world governing body, this first installment in the long running series used a dimetric (colloquially known as "isometric") viewpoint, previously unusual in football games but quickly imitated by several titles. The televisual presentation, one of the unique points of the early EA Sports titles, with hosts introducing the matches, was another thing making the game stand out from a market dominated by Sensible Soccer and Kick Off games.[CR]Based on international teams (with fictional player names), their abilities in each skill area rated out of 10 to give the player an overall impression of how good they are. The options available follow the standard set: fouls and offsides can be toggled on and off, the match length can be set, and if the timer operates  continuously, or only while the ball is in play. Gameplay privileges quick runs, short passes and blistering shots outside the penalty box, and set pieces are controlled by moving a box into the target area for the ball, and then passed, lobbed or kicked directly. On the tactical side, formations can be selected, with 5 different strategies also available (although not all of these combinations make sense) as can the team Coverage - the areas which defenders, midfielders and strikers cover.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Crazy Ball[CR]To make the ball's behavior more random, enter the following password.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Crazy Ball[CR]To have the ball bounce off the lines, enter the following password.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Crazy Ball[CR]To play the game with no penalties, enter the following password.</plot>

		<plot>"Aiming to be the first football simulation that is realistic in the true sense of the word, FIFA Soccer 96 was extremely popular at the time of release. It was hailed as the first really successful FIFA release, and opened the way for yearly revisions of the concept.[CR]There were a number of factors that made FIFA96 stand out from the crowd of other football sims. Firstly, the game's commentary was revolutionary at the time -- the renowned British commentator John Motson comments all the incidents and happenings on the pitch in real-time. The ambient commentary is varied, and systems with more than the minimum memory level get extra commentary phrases.[CR]The Virtual Stadium technology has numerous pre-defined camera angles. The game even has a SVGA mode for better-than-minimum system[CR]FIFA96 boasts eleven leagues from all around the world, ranging from the unknown players of the Malaysian league to the celebrated stars of the English and Italian leagues. 59 International teams are also featured, and it's possible to match the teams you want to against each other through friendlies, or you can also choose to play domestic tournaments or International ones such as the World Cup. If you're not satisfied with the composition of the various teams, you can create your own dream team through the custom team creator.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Cheat Codes[CR]Go to the passwords screen and enter:</plot>

		<plot>Baseball player Frank Thomas licensed one of the first baseball games to use motion-captured 3D graphics and multiple camera angles. 28 stadia have been rendered in 3D, and each has its own visible and significant differences. [CR]There are 6 distinct game modes, allowing for single exhibition matches as well as full seasons on the playoffs. There is also a Home Run Derby mode, allowing the player to pelt the ball out of the ground for points. [CR]You can choose pitchers and batters, based on their statistics and form. Bowling options are set to define the delivery, with fastballs and curveballs as well as more precise setting of pace and height. Fielding is optional - it's best to leave this to the computer at first You can always alter the infield and outfield depth and shift.</plot>

They can change their name and as well as their shirt color and select from four different difficulty levels.  Stroke Play can support up to four-players using Gear-to-Gear links.  Fred Couples himself is not a selectable character, instead the player competes against him.[CR]Before hitting the player is show an overhead view of the course and using the d-pad to plot the course of the ball, after this they can then choose which club they wish to hit with as well as the stance of their player.  After choosing their location they are then presented with an image of a golf ball and a power meter.  After pressing the "B" button to start the power meter and pressing again to stop, a dot will start to move left to right on the golf ball.  The player then presses the "B" button again when the dot is in the desired location to hit the ball.</plot>

		<title_clean>Frogger</title_clean>
		<plot>This unreleased Game Gear game was discovered by me when I worked at Sega, about three years ago. It was one of my better finds while I was at Sega, and honestly, one of the better games for the Game Gear! For those classic fans, it isnt "original" in its concept, but for those who like good games, this beats most other classic conversions hands down![CR]The concept of the game is to move your frog through various obstacles (cars/trucks that speed up and slow down at random, lilly pads, turtles that fall into the water and come back up, logs, water areas you can only cross in specific places, etc.) in each level and pick up the stranded frogs located throughout the level, then bring them back to the beginning, where they hop into your home. Rescue all the frogs in a level and you move onto the next level.[CR]The levels are much more challenging and more varied in their design in this version. Youll have to cross a log portion first, then therell be a car level, then therell be a lilly pad level, then another car level, etc. The varied obstacles really add a lot that was missing in the original Frogger. In addition, Frogger can now use his tongue to reach out and grab bugs or items for additional points, which adds yet another level of variety to this title![CR]Graphics have also been improved, in spite of the small screen they are displayed on. Everything is so crystal clear and the animation/graphics are so well drawn that it looks like youre playing a cartoon instead of a video game. Just about the only thing missing that would make this game perfect is animation sequences between the levels. Other than that, there arent many faults with this game![CR]Sounds are great in the game. They took the original Frogger music, which, at best was annoying, beefed it up and made different music titles and it turned out wonderfully! Sound effects are average for the Game Gear, which in itself isnt a bad thing, but could be a bit better. Its not enough to take away from the gameplay and with the music playing, its hardly noticeable.[CR]The game, despite needing a few bug fixes, seems complete and Im not really sure why this game wasnt released, perhaps because of licensing problems, perhaps because SOA didnt see any specific reason to release it (SOA has a tendency to not look back, or at least had until they released Sega Ages). It plays well, despite the pesky bugs, looks good and is, as I said before, one of the best games for the Game Gear. Whatever the reason for it not being released, its a shame that everyone cant buy a copy of this game![CR]https://www.digitpress.com/reviews/frogger_gg.htm[CR]</plot>

		<title_clean>G-LOC - Air Battle</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Designed by Yu Suzuki as a spiritual successor to the After Burner games, G-LOC: Air Battle was released in arcades and on the Sega Mega Drive / Genesis in 1990. In arcades, the game was released in three cabinet variants; a standard standup version, a sit-down version and the custom sitdown R-360 cabinet. The R-360 was able to rotate freely on two axes, allowing the cabinet to mimic in-game action, including turning the cabinet completely upside down. Due to the impressiveness of the R-360 cabinet the home computer versions (Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC, ZX Spectrum and Amiga) were named G-LOC R360.[CR]Some ports of the game included features not present in the arcade version. For instance the Mega Drive / Genesis version alternates between first and third-person perspectives, the Master System port features bosses and the Game Gear port allows the player to spend points earned while playing to upgrade the jet.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The player controls an experimental aircraft in timed missions - the player earns more time and advances stages by achieving goals that are set in each stage. During the course of the game the player is attacked from both the front and the back by enemy aircraft. The player controls the aircraft with a joystick and has two weapons: a cannon and missiles. The player can either try to gun down enemy planes or attempt to gain missile lock by moving the crosshair over them. The game is played mostly from a first person perspective, however once locked on to by an enemy the perspective changes to third person (behind the player's aircraft) to allow for evasive manoeuvers.[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]Michael Jackson owned an R-360 deluxe cabinet of this game. It was sold at the official Michael Jackson Auction on April 24, 2009.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] View the ending[CR]At the Title Screen press Right, Left, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1 and then Start to view the ending.</plot>

Your task on each level is to use a number of gears of one of 3 different sizes to ensure that all the pegs are linked together. All this has to be completed before the engine overheats.[CR]Making life harder are two creatures with the peculiar name Poffins. One of these goes around removing pegs, and the other causes the engine to overheat further. They can be shot out of the way, or have gears placed over them to stop them.[CR]Theres also a bonus round, which is a fruit machine, only with cogs and other things from the game rather than fruit.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Infinite Lives, Time and Items.[CR]Start a new game with the passcode 1203.

		<title_clean>George Foreman's KO Boxing</title_clean>
		<plot>The Master System and Game Gear versions of George Foreman's KO Boxing are fairly identical to the other versions in concept, but there are a few notable changes. The game is a reworking of the Master System title James 'Buster' Douglas Knockout Boxing, not to be confused with the Genesis title with the same name, which is entirely different.[CR]Just like the other versions players are cast as George Foreman to go through a series of boxing matches against different opponents to win the championship title belt. Compared to the other titles, these versions have new opponents and show the boxers from the side. Players can move left or right in the ring to avoid punches. Other moves including blocking, and left and right punches that can be varied into jabs and crosses. Matches can last up to ten rounds and when no regular or technical knock-out occurs, the winner is based on the jury's points, provided between the rounds. During knock-out phases, no buttons need to be pressed to get the boxer back to his feet. At the start of the game, a slow or fast speed for the gameplay can be selected.[CR]Each match the player's boxer can use three super punches. These need to be charged and then unleashed when near an opponent. It sends them straight to the back of the ring, a dangerous area as it is easy to keep punching them into the ropes. Health is slightly restored during the intermission and after each won match the player is awarded skill points to be distributed over three characteristics. Matches for two players are supported.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Cheat Mode[CR]At the Speed Select screen, hold down the 2 button and press Left, Right, Left. During a match, pause the game and use:Up for nine super punchesDown to recover lifeLeft to finish the roundRight to win the match2 end the match with a draw</plot>

The usual Aleste powerup systems remains fairly intact. You still have powerup pods which release P capsules for upgrading your main weapon.

Both primary and secondary weapons are in constant use, since only button 2 is used for firing both weapons at once.

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Greendog the Beached Surfer Dude! was released in the U.S. for the Sega Genesis on December 7, 1992. It was developed by Interactive Designs and published by Sega. A Game Gear version of the title was released subsequently.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Greendog, a surfer dude, was surfing in the Caribbean islands when an unusually large wave wipes him out. He emerges from the water with a mysterious golden pendant wrapped around his neck, one that cannot be removed. Greendog's bikini clad surfer girlfriend Bambi observes the scene from nearby, and explains to our hero that he must now traverse six different islands in order to obtain six lost pieces of an Aztec treasure if he intended on lifting the curse. Unfortunately, the curse turns everyone he comes in contact with against him in his quest. Greendog is also unable to surf until he removes the necklace.[CR]After his grueling journey across the islands comes to a close, Greendog lifts his curse using the surfboard of the Ancients. He then surfs the night sky, while Bambi watches from ashore. She is happy yet aware that the treasure's true power has yet to be unleashed, and Greendog's story has only just begun. No followup to Greendog was ever produced.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]A surfer dude that has seen better days[CR]The game plays much like other 16-bit side scrolling platformers and is remembered more fondly for it's setting and character than it's control. His main weapon is a frisbee, which is used for both long and short range attacks. Levels contain an area of location based side scrolling, followed by Aztec temples that hold dangerous terrain and puzzles. Greendog will then ride his cart copter in order to travel between islands. O some levels, such as Grenada or Jamaica, Greendog gets to travel by either skateboarding or rollerblading.[CR]Health items drop frequently in the form of fast food items and desserts. Special items such as the ability to temporarily stop time or equip Greendog with an umbrella hat are often found as well. Collecting both increases the overall score for the player, which is constantly displayed in the game's HUD along with damage, lives remaining, and up to four queued special items.[CR]Greendog's soundtrack features a dynamic mix of Calypso and Caribbean themes.[CR]The six islands in the game include:Grenada (Jungle)Mustique (Beach)Curacao (Underwater)Jamaica (City)Saba (Native Village)St. Vincent (Cave)[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Cheat Codes[CR]At any time during gameplay, press the START button to the pause, then enter any of the following codes:</plot>

		<title_clean>Gunstar Heroes</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The title screen[CR]Gunstar Heroes is a side-scrolling shooter where two brothers, Red and Blue, must defend their home planet Gunstar 9. The game was released in North America on September 9th, 1993, and Japan on September 10th, 1993. Gunstar Heroes was the first game to be developed by  Treasure. The game was published by  Sega, so it was originally released for the Sega Genesis, but can currently also be found on Game Gear, PlayStation 2 (as a Sega Ages game), and Virtual Console. The sequel,  Gunstar Super Heroes, is on the Game Boy Advance.[CR]Gunstar Heroes was released as a part of the Sega Vintage Collection on the Xbox Live Marketplace and PlayStation Network on June 10, 2009 and June 11, 2009 respectively. It differed from the original version in a couple ways. First, it includes the ability to "quick save" one's game, as the game is being run off an emulator (all other Sega Vintage games have this capability as well). Second, sprites can now be smoothed. Online cooperative play has also been added, as well as the obvious achievements for the Xbox Live Marketplace release and trophies for the PlayStation Network release.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The robot Golden Silver is used to suck dry a planet of all its resources. Professor White was able to defeat this robot in the past by removing its four gems and hiding it on one of planet Gunstar 9's moons. When the Empire found out about this, they sent Smash Daisaku to Gunstar 9. Here he brainwashed Gunstar Green and used him to find the four gems in order to resurrect Golden Silver and continue its resource sucking madness. Red and Blue set out to retrieve the gems and save their planet.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Similar to  Contra, the gameplay is 2D side scrolling run-and-gun shooter style and can be played in free form (the player can move while shooting) or fixed form (the player stops to shoot). The game also has melee combat, the player can slide, jump kick, and throw enemies. The weapon system uses four element types that the player can mix and match to yield different types of shots. These types are a lightning laser, flame thrower, homing missile, and a rapid machine gun. Gunstar Heroes is most famous for its boss encounters which have become a trademark of Treasure games. The bosses are usually the size of the entire screen and composed of several sprites against a scrolling background. The transforming  Seven Force boss is particularly memorable.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]RedRed/Blue: The playable characters who set out to collect the mystical gems and save their planet.Yellow: Red and Blue's sister. She gives gives brief descriptions on the level select screen. Green: Red and Blue's brother and the pilot of the Seven Force. He has been brainwashed by the evil Empire to work for them.Professor White: Helps Red and Blue with equipment.Minion Soldiers: Countless identical robotic soldiers of low intelligence, these are barely a threat. Orange: The boss of the flying warship level. This roid rager focuses on hand to hand combat attacks and can use a blue flame. Pink: A bounty hunter in a giant mining machine that appears as the boss of the Ancient Ruins. Black: A gambling-obsessed lieutenant to Daisaku, Black built a dice maze fortress that requires Red and Blue to engage in a game of chance to reach him. Smash Daisaku: An  M. Bison lookalike, and the leader of the Empire. He brainwashed Green to help him retrieve the gems. He is fought several times throughout the game and uses bombs and a jetpack to attack Red/Blue. Golden Silver: The Ultimate Destroyer, Golden Silver is a robot powered by the gems that is used to suck planets dry of all their resources. His body is completely invulnerable, requiring Red and Blue to get creative.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]Electronic Gaming Monthly gave Gunstar Heroes the review scores of 9,9,9, and 9 in addition to a "Editor's Choice Platinum" and Game of the Month awards.[CR]Martin Alessi wrote:[CR]This is one of the best looking carts I've seen from Sega in a while. The animation is slick as can be and the use of multiple sprites to form bosses is extremely well done... Definitely one of the most intense games I've seen on the home video game scene. Great gameplay, two player simultaneous action and nonstop intensity from beginning to end.[CR]</plot>

The final battle is about to commence![CR]Halley Wars is a vertical scrolling shooter. The game has 6 stages set in locations in space such as, above planets or in asteroid fields. There are end of levels bosses at the end of each stage each with their own weaknesses. There are power-ups, which can be picked up along the way when you shoot particular asteroids or satellites. These upgrade your weapon strength, speed, add explosive pods and shields.[CR]Where the game stood out was, there are comets that need to be destroyed on your journey. Each comet and ship that you dont shoot makes it to earth and does some damage there. Comets do more damage than the enemy ships do. If Earths damage level reaches 100% the game is over. For every 2000 points you score, 1% of Earths damage is repaired.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Special Options Menu[CR]At the Title Screen press Left, Left, Left, Left, Right, Right, Right, Right.</plot>

		<title_clean>Head Buster</title_clean>
		<plot>Head Buster is a so-called future sports game about robots. On a top-down, horizontally scrolling playfield, armed robots are moved around in a manner similar to Super Robot Taisen strategy games, albeit without many of the refinements of that series.[CR]Each game starts at the shop, where robots on your team are bought and equipped according to your tastes and finances. After that, the game begins in the robot arena, blue team against red team in one corner each. The goal is not explicitly to destroy the robots of the opposing team, but to destroy their base. In order to reach their base, and to prevent them from reaching yours, a certain amount of fighting is required. Each turn is split into a movement phase and a combat phase, and since actions of both sides are only executed when a phase is over, you cannot know when moving how close you will get to your opponents.[CR]Robots are available in three basic classes, from light to heavy, but can be modified with new movement units (different terrain squares have different movement properties), better armour and new weapons. Different weapons have both different strength and different ranges, as well as a limited supply of bullets. Reloading is done during the combat phase, but requires that your robot stays out of combat during that turn. Different sensors and command units can also be added, giving the robots better aim or particular abilities such as dodging, shielding and healing.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] 10,000 Gold[CR]From the Main Menu, choose Password, then choose Long.

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B]The blueprints screen allows you to booby trap the house in several different ways.[CR]In Home Alone the player takes on the role of Kevin McCallister, the protagonist of the movie. The goal of the game is to prevent the games villians, Harry and Marv, known collectively as The Wet Bandits, from looting the houses in the neighborhood. The player accomplishes this by causing &#8220;pain&#8221; to the burglars. This can be accomplished in one of two ways: booby traps and weapons. The first time Kevin enters each house he is given the chance to place traps. Kevin starts the game with a BB gun and can craft additional weapons, made from items found throughout the houses and the surrounding neighborhood. Weapons are made of three components: Platform; Operator; and Ammo.Kevin's just hanging out.[CR]There are several meters in the game. When outdoors, you are always provided with the Charge meter. As long as Kevin has &#8220;Charge&#8221;, he can boost the movement speed of his sled. This is especially useful when smashing through snowmen to reveal items or outrunning the bandit&#8217;s van to the next house. The Charge meter can be refilled by finding batteries. Indoors, you have three meters: Ammo; Loot; and Pain. Ammo depletes as Kevin uses his equipped weapon, and will automatically refill if he finds additional ammo for the equipped weapon. The Loot meter will fill as Harry and Marv empty the safes located around the house they currently occupy. Once the meter is filled, the house becomes &#8220;flooded&#8221;, in reference to the Wet Bandits calling card of clogging sinks and letting the water run. Pain will fill as the bandits encounter the traps that were previously laid out or as they are hit by Kevin&#8217;s weapons.[CR]If the bandits catch Kevin, they will hang him on a hook, but he can escape by wiggling in all directions. Some of the houses have a guard character that will attack any intruder, including Kevin.[CR]The game will end in a Game Over if the player in unsuccessful in stopping the Wet Bandits from &#8220;flooding&#8221; all of the houses. If the player is able to fend the Bandits off for the twenty minute time limit they will win the game.[CR]The game does have a higher difficulty that will unlock new items and weapons to be crafted.ItemsHome Alone features a weapon crafting system that lets you combine items you find around the neighborhood .Tire &#8211; Can be dropped indoors to help reach higher areasPepperBlow DryerBallBalloonsCoalsSnowballsRubber BandWireCanGlueMagnetCrossbowScoopTrapsTorchIceTarToysMarbles[CR]</plot>

		<plot>In this video game adaption of the Steven Spielberg film Hook, the player takes the role of a grown-up Peter Pan, whose kids have been kidnapped by Captain Hook. Tinker Bell takes Peter back to Neverland where he must again become Pan and reclaim his children.[CR]This particular interpretation is a side-scrolling action game, in which players must hack their way past Hook's denizens through 11 levels.  These include forests, icy regions, and towns which Peter will have to jump, climb, and swim through. Magic items such as apples and pixie dust can be collected for special powers. When enemies are attacked, they simply put their hands up in surrender rather than dying, so as to make the game more child-friendly.</plot>

		<title_clean>Incredible Crash Dummies, The</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The Incredible Crash Dummies (known as "The Incredible Crash Dummies: Slick Bouya no Daichousen" in Japan. The subtitle roughly translates as "Slick's Great Challenge") is an action platformer game based on the Incredible Crash Dummies license, a toy series that became an animated TV show. The player controls Slick, one of the titular Incredible Crash Dummies, and must rescue Dr Zub from the evil Junkman before he can use the good Doctor's knowledge to create an army of robots.[CR]The game was released on many home systems of the era, some of which varied slightly in their presentation and gameplay. [CR]Game Boy Version[CR]The Game Boy version of The Incredible Crash Dummies featured many different forms of gameplay, resembling more of a mini-game collection than its Super Nintendo counterpart. Players must either successfully crash the playable dummy, or successfully pass the Dummy through various levels.Levels (Dummy Stunts)[CR]Five separate stunts await the Dummy for testing. The Roof Jump comprises of a vertical drop off the edge of a burning building. Players receive more points for each awning they are able to break, and for each fire hazard they are able to avoid. A target is painted on the sidewalk, which the Dummy must hit in order to progress to the next stage of testing.[CR]The Air Bumper stage puts the Dummy behind the wheel of a new car model, with improved air bumper safety features. The player must steer the car over air cans in order to inflate the bumper, while avoiding large pits on the test track, along with oil slicks that cause the Dummy's vehicle to spin out.[CR]The Ski Slope tests the Dummy's agility and reflexes, as trees must be avoided, and points are awarded for any jumps completed.[CR]The Dummy proceeds to enter the Bomb Factory, where the player must ensure the quality of bombs created by blowing out any lit fuses. Failing to do so on any three bombs will result in the stunt starting over. Conveyor belts move the bombs from the top of the screen to the bottom, with other various items. The Dummy is instructed to smash all of the other items with a mallet, ensuring that only quality tested bombs make it through the factory.[CR]The Cruise Missle stunt is an arcade style level, where the player navigates a space ship in an extremely low gravity environment. Changing the ship's trajectory requires rotating the vehicle and igniting the engine, creating a delicate balance between speed and maneuverability as the player is timed. The Dummy must crash the ship on yet another bulls eye, ending the stunt.[CR]After the end of each stunt, the Dummy's boss will critique the player's work. The Dummy receives cash if the stunt went as planned, and a small bonus if the boss was impressed. Three levels of difficulty are presented, with easy, normal, and hard, encouraging the player to revisit each stunt for more cash.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the SNES version a review score of 4 out of 10. Mike Weigand wrote, "...This side-scrolling, survive the levels-type game is cute at times, but the poor control and mandatory cheap hits by enemies ruin things".[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level Select, Difficulty Select and Sound Test[CR]Wait for the title screen to change to text and press Up, Down, Left, Right. Enter the numerical passwords below.</plot>

The game stars Itchy and Scratchy from Fox's The Simpsons and retains the comical violence from the TV show. You play as Itchy in the Super Nintendo version, and Scratchy in the Game Gear version.  [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR] The Itchy and Scratchy Game is a platforming game, with weapons, and dangerous detours within the levels. You play as Itchy and start out with a mallet, and various weapons are usable later through the game, by matching the theme of the level you are on. There are seven stages in total, and all levels have blocked paths, or in need of key items to then unlock the path and continue on. You can kill enemies by hitting them with your weapon, and taking to much hits can result in the players death as well, as there is a health bar. There will also be a boss battle at the end of each stage, utilizing some sort of puzzle within the fight.[CR]</plot>

		<title_clean>James Pond II - Codename RoboCod</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]James Pond 2: Codename RoboCod is the second game in the James Pond series, which is also known as Super James Pond. It features the piscine special agent in a new mission at the North Pole. Unlike its free-form predecessor, James Pond 2 is a far more traditional side-scrolling platformer.[CR]The game was originally released on the Commodore Amiga, Atari ST and the Sega Genesis in 1991. They were followed with ports to the Amiga CD32, C64, Game Boy, Game Gear, Sega Master System and the Super Nintendo. It has recently received additional graphically enhanced ports for the Nintendo DS, PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Network.[CR]There have been multiple publishers for the game. The SNES port alone has three: Victor Interactive Software published the game in Japan, American Softworks in the US and Ocean Software in Europe. EA, US Gold and others have published the game on other systems.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]James Pond 2: Codename Robocod is a side-scrolling platformer which is very similar in feel and gameplay to the early Super Mario Bros. games. The player takes on the role of James Pond; a walking fish with body armor who must free all of the Penguins and Toys that the evil Dr. Maybe has captured. In addition to the more traditional elements of platforming, the player has the ability to extend James' body vertically in order to reach platforms and items. He also has access to a number of vehicles throughout the game, such as cars, biplanes and a flying bath.[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]The UK version of the game contains one of the earliest known forms of in-game product placements with the Penguins in the game advertising the "Penguin" chocolate bar by McVities.The SNES version of the game was called Super James Pond in North America, whereas in other regions it was called Super James Pond 2.The Playstation, Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS versions of the game are re-makes rather than ports, with changes to music, level design and art, they are generally considered to be inferior games.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]Electronic Gaming Monthly's Mike Weigand revealed little in his short review of the SNES version of the game other than his review score of 5 out of ten. He wrote, "...James's ability to make himself tall is quite interesting, but that is really the only special thing about him". He suggested that fans of the franchise may prefer Aquatic Games.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Invincibility[CR]Collect the following objects in order at the first jump up point: cupcake, hammer, globe, apple, and faucet. James Pond may now enter any door and is invincible. Note: Falling off the screen will still harm your character.  [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Invincibility[CR]Collect the following items in order to refill your power batteries - Penguin, Oil Can, Wine Glass, Earth and Racket - spelling POWER.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Invincibility[CR]Collect the following items in order to gain an Unlimited Lives Combo - Lips, Ice Cream, Violin, Earth, Snowman - spelling LIVES.</plot>

It does feature sports-related questions as the main bulk of the game where the player answers questions in three rounds using the D-Pad to spell out answers.  However, it does not feature digitized contestants, studio or the host Alex Trebek, though it does feature a photo likeness of him for intros.  Instead it features a more cartoonish look without sports-themed contestants and less questions than the console versions.  It does feature a two-player option utilizing the link cable allowing friends to compete head-to-head, but only allows the player to compete against one computer opponent as opposed to two as in other versions.</plot>

		<plot>Strider has been called into action to save the people of the planet Magenta, armed with a Gyro laser and matter converter. He must fight his way through a forest, a ruined city, underground colonies, a roof-top battle, and finally the prison ship in which the Megantan leader is held.[CR]The gameplay is similar to the original, consisting of running, jumping and attacking, with a very dynamic central character. The laser gun can be used while standing still; moving attacks with the sword are still possible, with the two weapons combining similarly to the Switchblade games. Tokens can be collected, which will turn you into a robot to face the end-of-level enemies if enough are collected.[CR]https://www.mobygames.com/game/game-gear/strider-2_[CR]</plot>

		<title_clean>Judge Dredd</title_clean>
		<plot>Judge Dredd is a platform action game based on the British comic book character of the same name and the 1995 movie that tarnished that name.  The game was a multi system release so it fits the standard console jump/shoot/duck formula although it does add some unique twists such as wounding enemies so that they surrender and can be arrested.[CR]The initial levels follow the plot of the movie with futuristic lawman Judge Dredd framed and sent to the Aspen penal colony from which he must escape and prove his innocence.  Following the fight at the top of the Statue of Liberty that ended the film, the game continues on with levels and characters inspired by the comic book culminating with a battle against the Dark Judges on Deadworld.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Stage Select[CR]In the main menu, put the cursor on START GAME and press 2, Left, Right, Left, Right, 1.

		<plot>This 8-bit adaptation of Disney's 1967 animated film Jungle Book is slightly different from the other versions. Although most of the main elements remain the same, the most noticeable differences are in level design and some missing items.[CR]The player controls Mowgli in his journey to the human village. Mowgli will swing on and climb vines, run and jump while facing enemies such as coconut-throwing monkeys, snakes and vampire bats. To fight them, Mowgli can throw bananas in eight directions. He'll also find upgrades and weapons such as boomerangs inside banana bunches. There are some boss fights with main characters of the movie, such as the snake Kaa.[CR]The objective of each of the 10 time-limited levels (or "scenes") is to collect gems scattered around them. Collecting certain amounts of gems grant access to bonus levels. The player starts the game with 4 lives and 1 continue.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Stage Select[CR]After the Walt Disney logo appears, rotate the D-pad in either direction until a sound plays. Begin a game and a screen with the words ''CHEAT MODE'' will appear. Use Left and Right to change the stage, then press Start to begin at the stage you selected.</plot>

		<title_clean>Jurassic Park</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Jurassic Park is an action game released on multiple systems to tie-in with the movie of the same name. In each version of the game the player takes on the role of Dr Alan Grant and follows the events of the movie (and the book it is based on).[CR]There are numerous differences between the various versions. The titles on Nintendo's platforms were handled by Ocean Software while Sega's titles were developed by BlueSky Software.[CR]The 1993 Sega CD version, which is an a point and click adventure game rather than an action game, has a separate page here.[CR]Genesis Version[CR]A Tyrannosaurus breaks through the wall of the power plant.[CR]BlueSky's Genesis title is a 2D platformer which allowed the player to play as either Dr. Grant or a Velociraptor while they attempted to escape Isla Nublar. Since the game began development before the film had been completed the designers had to borrow heavily from the novel for stages. With additions like the pump station and river levels being ripped directly from the novel.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] when selecting Dr. Grant is a standard side-scrolling action platformer. As he attempts to escape the island he amasses an arsenal of non-lethal weapons such as darts, smoke grenades, and tasers. This character's series of levels leads him through locales such as a power plant, a river (where he pilots a motorboat), and the interior of an active volcano. Grant's finale sees him reaching the visitor's center and escaping the island via helicopter.The hunt continues.[CR]Opting to play as the Velociraptor gives the player access to a completely different arsenal, namely the raptor's claws. The raptor's main goals are to eventually defeat Dr. Grant and reach the mainland. Playing through each level will require the raptor to defeat armed guards still stationed on the island as well as other hostile dinosaurs. The raptor's campaign is noticeably shorter than Grant's, completely skipping levels such as the volcano and river. Completing the game as the raptor shows that it successfully escaped the island by concealing itself in a crate that is loaded into a cargo ship.[CR]After the successful sales of the Genesis version BlueSky released a sequel to Jurassic Park, Jurassic Park: Rampage Edition. The Master System and Game Gear versions of the game were similar to the Genesis version, but developed by Sega separately in Japan and didn't feature the raptor protagonist.[CR]SNES Version[CR]The SNES version of Jurassic Park is incredibly different from its Genesis counterpart. In the game the player controls Grant from a top down perspective and is given the task of collecting a number of velociraptor eggs before they hatch. Along with a much more cartoony and brighter look, it also has first-person indoor sections in the same vein as Doom where Grant has to collect key cards and codes for use outside.[CR]For the most part, the game is very open-ended, not unlike some earlier Zelda games. The game requires Grant to do a lot of backtracking and hunting for items which helps progress the player through the story. Unfortunately the game has no save or password function so the player would have to collect all of the eggs in one sitting, a very daunting task with lots of trial-and-error gameplay involved.[CR]Game Gear Version[CR]The Game Gear version has more in common with the Genesis version, being a side-scrolling shooter. With the only weapon being a pistol, the player once again assumes the role of Dr. Grant. Progression from level to level is non-linear, giving the player the option to choose which area of the island they want to tackle first. Before the actual side-scrolling segments of each zone the player would play through a vehicle segment. In these segments the player would shoot down dinosaurs pursuing the jeep, successfully clearing these levels granted bonuses. Each level is unique in its design, showcasing a different area of the island, complete with a boss fight at the end. Clearing all the selectable levels opened the Visitor Center finale, where Grant would be confronted by the park's Tyrannosaurus.[CR]Game Boy &amp; NES Versions[CR]The NES and Game Boy versions were basically the same game.[CR]Like the SNES Jurassic Park, the Game Boy and NES versions were also developed by Ocean Software. Also similar to the SNES version, the main goal of each stage is to simply collect a certain number of dinosaur eggs, opening access to the next area. Blocking progress through these stages is an assortment of dinosaurs, including main enemies like velociraptors, procompsognathus, and dilophosaurus. To deal with these threats, the player is given one primary weapon, bearing a strong resemblance to a rocket launcher. As Grant kills dinosaurs they drop ammunition for his armament. Interspersed between levels are boss encounters, including a sequence where the player is required to dodge stampeding triceratops, as well as a fight where Grant does battle with a Tyrannosaurus.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Sound Test[CR]Hold down the Start button while turning on the system for a Sound Test.Note: This only works in the Japanese release of the game.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Health Restore[CR]Continuously shoot in front of the windshield at the start of any level with a jeep. Health will be restored when the jeep goes over a bump.  [CR]</plot>

		<title_clean>Kenyuu Densetsu Yaiba</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Kenyuu Densetsu Yaiba ("Legend of the Swordmaster Yaiba") is a video game adaptation of the anime and manga of the same name about the samurai youth Yaiba who is the latest incarnation of the Thunder God. The lighthearted manga/anime takes its inspiration from Japanese folklore, but transplants it into a modern setting.[CR]The game is an action RPG, where the protagonist fights monsters in real-time without transitioning to a separate battle screen. The game loosely follows the first arc of its source material, in which Yaiba must defeat his rival Onimaru and the various demons he summons (many of whom end up joining Yaiba's party after being defeated, becoming support characters). Yaiba has a number of AI support characters, including his faithful vulture companion Shonosuke, who will fly Yaiba back to the nearest safehouse for healing/saving. Others include Yaiba's love interest Sayaka, who can use cure magic to heal Yaiba, and Kagetora, Yaiba's tiger companion who fights alongside him. The game also has a two-player mode where the second player controls Rai; a character created for the game.[CR]Banpresto published Kenyuu Densetsu Yaiba for the Super Famicom, Game Boy and Sega Game Gear in 1994. The portable versions are side-scrolling action games, whereas the Super Famicom action RPG uses a top-down perspective.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Debug Menu[CR]At the Title Screen, press 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1+2.</plot>

		<title_clean>Kinetic Connection</title_clean>
		<plot>The Game Gear version of Kinetic Connection has been rearranged a lot from the original version released 5 years earlier to cope with a smaller screen and Sega's taste in motifs.[CR]As the original version, Kinetic Connection is a jigsaw puzzle game, where the pieces are animated. This makes putting the pieces together to form the overall picture both more interesting and more difficult, since the player can not analyse each piece at his own pace when the entire puzzle is moving about. Pieces also need to be flipped around both on the X and Y axis in order to fit together.[CR]The game has 7 puzzles, some of which are carried over from the earlier versions but mostly new ones designed with Sega characters. Due to the small screen, the pieces are not kept in a box at the bottom of the screen as in the original Kinetic; instead they are all placed out on the grid already, in a random order. Each puzzle can be played in three different modes:[CR]Mode 1 lets the player swap pieces around as he likes. Mode 2 lacks one piece and lets the player slide pieces around as in a sliding puzzle. Mode 3 lets the player slide entire rows and columns around in the puzzle. The two second modes call for much more thought when solving the moving puzzles.</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The game objective is to line up colored blocks into rows of similar colors to make them disappear. Atari Games originally released it as a coin-op follow up to Tetris, which they were tangled in a legal dispute about at the time. Klax features a conveyor belt at the top of the screen which rolls toward the playing area, delivering a steady supply of colored blocks. The player controls a small device which sits at the interface between the conveyor belt and the playing area. By moving this left and right, the player can catch the blocks and deposit them in the playing area. Failure to catch any block results in it falling down the gap between the conveyor belt and playing area and one drop being used. Once all of the drops are used, the player is given a chance to continue. Otherwise, the game ends. (In the original coin-op, the game ends when all drops are used.)[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Stage Select[CR]At the Title Screen, press 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2.</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Krusty's Fun House (or Krusty's Super Fun House) is a puzzle game in which Krusty the Clown, of The Simpsons fame, is trying to eradicate all the rodents in his titular fun house. The goal is to convince the rats to march towards the machines that will eliminate them (staffed by Bart and Homer Simpson, as well as Krusty Show characters Sideshow Mel and Corporal Punishment) by using objects found in the vicinity. Like the Lemmings from the series of the same name, the rats will simply follow a set of rules defined by their programming and the player can use this to anticipate their actions and plan accordingly in order to trap them.[CR]The game was based on Audiogenic's earlier Amiga game Rat-Trap, which was licensed out to Acclaim so they could turn it into a The Simpsons licensed game. Acclaim published the game on almost every platform imaginable at the time, sub-licensing the home computer versions to Virgin Games.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level Passwords[CR]Enter the following passwords.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level Passwords[CR]Enter the following password.</plot>

		<title_clean>Last Action Hero</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Last Action Hero is a brawler that follows the plot of  Arnold Schwarzenegger's movie, released in the summer of 1993. The player controls Jack Slater, an LA police detective that must beat up hordes of thugs in order to progress through each of six stages. Most of the gameplay consists of repetitive fights against a few different types of enemies, using a very limited number of attacks. The game presents an extreme challenge to even experienced players, mirroring the difficulty of some earlier NES games.[CR]The game was released on multiple home systems. There are three discrete versions from different developers:The Bits Studios release, which is a brawler that lacks a depth of field (similar to early games in the genre, like Vigilante) and features a couple of action stages where Slater must chase down enemies via his convertible. It was released on the SNES and Genesis, and both versions are largely identical save for a few graphical and gameplay tweaks. There's also a much more compact variant for the Game Boy and Game Gear.The Teeny Weeny Games release for the NES. This is a much more standard brawler, like Double Dragon. The stages have entirely different layouts, and even includes a stage based on a dream sequence in the movie where the main character re-imagines Hamlet as an explosive blockbuster.The Psygnosis release for MS-DOS and the Amiga. This is, again, a brawler with driving sequences, though the game looks and plays completely differently to the Bits Studios release. This version originally appeared on DOS several months after the home console versions, and was ported to the Amiga by The Dome Software.[CR]Last Action Hero received overwhelmingly negative reviews from critics due to poor graphics, repetitive fighting, and a lackluster set of controls. In fact, Last Action Hero has frequently been cited as "one of the worst SNES games ever made." A rundown of all the different versions of this game can be found on Hardcore Gaming 101.[CR] [CR]</plot>

The king's adviser said the only way to stop the shadow would be for the king himself to travel out and to seek the cure. But the cowardly king Pete preferred to stay in the castle, and sent a simple laundry boy named Mickey instead! [CR]As Mickey Mouse, you will travel through various levels in this platform game. Mickey shoots an unlimited amount of little balls on the enemies, can jump, climb on stairs, hang on ropes, and perform other tricks.

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The first level - 'Just Dig'.Originally an Amiga exclusive, developed by DMA design (later becoming Rockstar North) was met with an exceptional reception and was quickly ported to many different platforms. A puzzle game that requires players to direct a group of green haired, blue-shirted, lemmings from point A to point B. The game is based on the myth that lemmings migrate in large groups and follow a single leader, who would often lead them off a cliff to their demise. In the game, lemmings constantly march in one direction unless they run into an obstacle, at which point they turn around and walk the other way. Being fearless and unaware of their own mortality, the lemmings will blindly run into fire, jump off cliffs, become crushed and fall victim to numerous other pitfalls.The player must command the lemmings to do certain tasks in order to complete each stage and get a certain percentage of lemmings to safety. These actions include digging, using a pick axe to dig diagonally, using their arms (windmill style) to punch horizontally through terrain and building staircases to traverse large gaps.[CR][B]Levels:[/B][CR]All levels in Lemmings consist of at least one entrance, and at least one exit. The aim in each level is to safely get an allocated amount of lemmings towards an exit.

Remember to use the line of scrimmage glitch to your advantage and move him down a little bit.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Easily block punts[CR]When the ball is snapped, you'll easily be able to use your superior speed to charge in and block the punt due to the running back in the punt formation never moving over to assist in the blocking scheme.

If done correctly, you will not be called offsides when the play begins. The line of scrimmage in Madden 95 is parallel to the feet of the offensive lineman as opposed to the ball, which is why you're able to line up so close to the offense in the first place.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Easily block punts[CR]When the ball is snapped, you'll have plenty of time to blast your defender through the line untouched, and you'll be able to stop virtually every play in the game.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Easily block punts[CR]After scoring a touchdown, you can use a very simple glitch to guarantee yourself an extra two points.

		<plot>This game is based on the anime and manga by manga artist CLAMP.[CR]In the land of Cephiro, the world was kept in peace and harmony by the wishes of Princess Emauraude, the Pillar of Balance. But the evil priest, Lord Zagato, has kidnapped Emauraude, and Cephiro is being invaded by deadly beasts. If this continues, Zagato will gain complete control of Cephiro! The only ones who can stop him are the legendary Magic Knights...[CR]And those Magic Knights are three young girls from Earth. Hikaru Shidou, Umi Ryuuzaki, and Fuu Hououjii have been plucked from modern-day Tokyo and brought to Cephiro by Emauraude, and they're the only ones who can defeat Zagato...as the Magic Knights![CR]This interpretation of the manga story is a traditional Japanese-style RPG. The player controls the three main heroines as a party; each one uses different weapons and learns various skills. Typically for the genre, the party roams the top-down world, visits towns, descends into dungeons, chats with non-playable characters, and fights randomly appearing enemies in turn-based style.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Play the Rayearth Picture Slot Mini-Game[CR]In order to play a special mini-game, you must enter these command on the title screen (Do not push start):Press button 2 five times, push button 1 twice, push button 2 five times, push button 1 ONCE. Then, push and hold button 1 and while still holding button 1, push and hold button 2. If done correctly, you will leave the title screen and play a little game with Mokona.</plot>

To do so, he'll have to avoid Nyamco and his kitty flunkies, the Mewkies. Mappy can slow them down by shoving a door in their face, ringing a bell to stun them, or even get rid of them for good by putting them in the microwave. [CR]Scoring features a multiplier if Mappy gathers items in pairs. The items are:RadioTelevisionComputerMona LisaSafe[CR]With the radio being worth 100 points, increasing in 100 point increments with the safe being 500.[CR]If Mappy takes too long gathering up the stolen goods, a warning will issue, and then an indestructible enemy will appear and chase Mappy throughout the level. Unlike with the cats, should the enemy meet Mappy in midair he will get hit. There is also a limiter for how many times a player can use a trampoline in a row. Should Mappy bounce too often on one it'll break, causing him to fall and die if there isn't another trampoline below to break his fall.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Mappy: Mappy is the lovable mouse cop hero of the game. He can jump on trampolines, stun Mewkies and Nyamcos with doors, and confiscate stolen items. He also has a billy club that he doesn't use.[CR]Mewky: Mewkies (also known as Meowkies in the US version), are the little pink kitty flunkies of the bigger cat mastermind, Nyamco. They will chase after Mappy if they see him. Mappy can knock them silly by opening doors on them, or temporarily get rid of them with the flashing microwave door.[CR]Nyamco: Nyamco (also known as Goro in the US version), is the big head honcho cat crime boss. He will also chase after Mappy if he sees him. Sometimes, he'll hide behind a random electronic item and if Mappy takes the item he's hiding behind, he'll score a sweet score bonus for catching Nyamco red-handed.

		<title_clean>Marble Madness</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Originally released as a trackball arcade game from Atari Games, Marble Madness was created, designed and programmed by developer Mark Cerny. The object is to guide a marble through a maze, avoiding obstacles along the way. Marble Madness is well known for it's soundtrack and was the first arcade cabinet to include stereo sound. This was the first game to be released on Atari's System 1 hardware, which allowed arcade owners to convert a machine into another game with the changing of just a few different parts. The success of the game has led it to being ported to many systems such as the NES, Master System and the Commodore 64.Marble Madness, along with Archon and Deluxe Paint, were some of the first "killer apps" for the Amiga and greatly contributed to the system's initial appeal and sales.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]You think you can get the marble through this course? Madness!Marble Madness is played from an isometric third-person perspective. The object of the game is to maneuver a colored marble through several different courses in the constraints of a time limit. Each ends when the marble reaches an end goal (helpfully marked "GOAL"). The player's marble carried momentum and a rudimentary physics model provided most of the challenge, as it was easy to fall off the side of the narrow courses.Finishing a course adds the remaining time to the limit placed on the next course. In the original arcade release, the player used a trackball to control the movement of the marble. Later home versions changed the controls to a directional pad or other control mechanism.The marble can be destroyed by falling off the course or by simply dropping too far onto another platform. In the event that the marble is shattered in a fall, a cartoon broom will appear and sweep the broken pieces away before respawning the player's marble near by. While there was no "lives remaining" counter, each fall or death wasted valuable time. Courses were designed in a manner that made it extremely difficult to finish within the time limit if the player lost more than one or two marbles.As the game goes on, enemies and obstacles are introduced to the player to make course completion more difficult. The player will run into challenges like moving platforms, catapults, a black "enemy" marble that would attempt to ram the player off the course, and even a course that must be run uphill instead of downhill. An option is also included which allows two players to race each other down any of the courses at the same time.Races:Practice Race: The first course, shorter than the others.Beginner Race: Longer, but relatively less complicated than the later courses.Intermediate Race: Featuring moving green hills and moving pools of acid that will swallow the marble.Aeriel Race: Featuring narrower platforms.Silly Race: This is the course which must be run uphill instead of downhill.Ultimate Race: Featuring many of the obstacles from earlier in the game, making it the most difficult race of all.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level Select[CR]Before starting the game, at the main menu, set the sound test options to the following:</plot>

		<plot>Master of Darkness is a Platformer very similar to Castlevania.[CR]You play as a psychologist trying to defeat Dracula. This requires you to fight your way through several spooky locations such as cemeteries, laboratories, castles or a house of wax dolls. To defeat your enemies, you can use several primary and secondary weapons. Primary weapons are close combat weapons ranging from knifes to rapiers and axes, that differ in range and efficiency. Secondary weapons are long-range weapons (pistols, bombs etc.) with limited ammunition. The game features 5 Rounds divided into 3 stages. At the end of each stage, a boss must be defeated.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Cheat Mode[CR]At the Title Screen, while the text Press Start Button is flashing, press Start then quickly hold the following three buttons: 1+2+Up.</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Released in 1995, Mega Man for the Game Gear was published by U.S. Gold, Ltd. and developed by Capcom. The game is based largely on Mega Man 4 and Mega Man 5, although it borrows aspects from other games in the franchise such as Mega Man 2. A few notable differences from other Mega Man games include the fact that there is one Robot Master who does not have a weakness (Wave Man, whose weakness is Charge Man's Charge Kick, which does not appear in this game). Additionally, the small screen size of the Game Gear increases the game's difficulty and also causes an increase in vertical scrolling; an effect that was noted by some critics.[CR]The plot of Mega Man is borrowed from Mega Man 4, although the player never fights Dr. Cossack. Rather, the player goes through Wave Man and Toad Man's stages respectively, also fighting the two bosses. After going through those stages, the player goes through Dr. Wily's castle; a single stage which is identical to Quick Man's stage from Mega Man 2.[CR]Robot Masters[CR]Bright ManBright ManModel No.: DWN-025Weapon: Flash StopperWeakness: Star CrashNapalm ManNapalm ManModel No.: DWN-039Weapon: Napalm BombWeakness: Flash StopperStar ManStar ManModel No.: DWN-037Weapon: Star CrashWeakness: Power StoneStone ManStone ManModel No.: DWN-035Weapon: Power StoneWeakness: Napalm BombWave ManWave Man[CR](One of two bosses in Dr. Cossack's fortress)Model No.: DWN-034Weapon: Water WaveWeakness: NoneToad ManToad Man[CR](One of two bosses in Dr. Cossack's fortress)Model No.: DWN-026Weapon: Rain FlushWeakness: Water Wave[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Final level passwords[CR]Please enter the following at the password screen:[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Final level passwords[CR]Enter the following at the password screen:</plot>

		<plot>One night, as Mickey (or Minnie) lay in bed reading a book of fairy tales, he started to wonder how it would be to live in a far off land, in a magic castle. As he fell asleep, he woke up in the Kingdom of Beanwick, which is constantly tormented by earthquakes. Then, he offers his help to solve the mystery behind those earthquakes.[CR]Mickey's Ultimate Challenge is a puzzle game in which the player chooses either Mickey or Minnie to play with. They'll find five characters from the Disney's universe in the kingdom, and will be prompted to help them in several tasks.[CR]Each task is a different puzzle, given by a specific character. Daisy, for instance, will ask help to clean the castle's paintings hanging on a wall. The task is in fact a memory game, where Mickey or Minnie must clean the pictures matching pairs. After completing one task, they'll receive a gift.[CR]After completing all tasks, Mickey or Minnie must trade the gifts they won with the right characters. For instance, after finishing Goofy's task, they will receive his hammer. The player must then guess who among the other characters would like to receive that hammer.[CR]Giving the right items to the right characters will allow Mickey or Minnie access to the last puzzle and character.</plot>

		<title_clean>Micro Machines</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Micro Machines is a circuit-type racing game with top-down graphics. Players select a character from a vast roster and race against CPU or human opponents; neither the races nor the cars the player finds himself in are related to the character. Each character has a CPU strength rating but there are zero differences between them when played by human players.[CR]Micro Machines is based on the toy line of the same name of very small collectible car models. To suit their miniature form, each course in the game is set in a region of a regular home: the kitchen table, a games room with a pool table, a garden, etc.[CR]Micro Machines was released on almost every console and home computer system available in 1994. It also saw a sequel: Micro Machines 2: Turbo Tournament.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]One Player Mode[CR] Head-to-Head[CR]In this mode there are only two vehicles are in play: one player controlled and one AI. The objective is to gain enough distance between the opponent as to make him stay out of the screen, when this happens the car on screen is awarded a point from the opponent's pool (each player starts with 4 each). These points go back and forth until someone has all eight points or the race ends naturally after three laps.Challenge[CR]This mode places the player in 25 races against three other AI controlled vehicles. The player starts with a set number of lives, and loses them for each race where they don't place in the top two places. Once they run out of lives, they are eliminated. The AI characters are also eliminated and replaced by stronger opponents as they place badly through the races.[CR] Two Player ModeHead-to-Head[CR]This mode is the same as described in the "One Player" section, only both vehicles are human-controlled.[CR] Tournament[CR]In Tournament two players are pitted against each other in the same fashion as Head-to-Head for a series of five races and whoever wins most races out of the five is declared winner.[CR]Vehicles and Environments[CR]The type of vehicles change, and are fixed for each environment:[CR] Bathtub - Powerboats[CR]These are standard powerboats with standard handling. The Bathtub stages are relatively free of course hazards.[CR] [CR] [CR] Breakfast Table - Four by Four[CR]A four-by-four jeep like off-roader that controls well over rough terrain. The breakfast table is filled with food spills that the four-by-four has little trouble with.[CR] [CR] [CR] Desktop - Sportcars[CR]These convertible cars may be small but they do put out a fight with a high top speed and finicky handling. The Desktop environment has a lot of ramps and barricades.[CR] [CR] [CR] Worktop - Warriors[CR]A group of mean looking cars that look like they come right out of Mad Max. Decent handling and speed but are best suited for bumping each other off the course. The worktop is filled with tools and other impassable objects.Billiards Table - Formula One[CR]Formula One (or open-wheel) racecars, like in real life, sport extremely high top speeds on straights and high acceleration without a compromise on the corners. The billiards table naturally has a lot of pool balls and cues to get in the players' way.Sandbox - Turbo Wheels[CR]Dune buggy vehicles designed for the sandy terrain of the sandbox. Obstacles include buckets and spades.Garden - Choppers[CR]The helicopters have tricky turning cycles but are able to fly over all but the tallest obstacles in the garden course. [CR] Bedroom floor - Tanks[CR]Tanks are slow vehicles with poor turning but have the advantage of shooting one's opponent, forcing them to respawn behind the player's location. The goal of these stages is to stay ahead and elude the shots of those behind them. The bedroom floor stage is filled with toys and other obstacles to use as cover.Backyard - Rufftrux[CR]Huge monster trucks in a special time trial race. Fit through the obstacles to earn a 1up on this stage.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Although the player's character doesn't determine the racing characteristics of their vehicle, the computer A.I. of each character is different. Spider is notably a very fast opponent.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Hard Modes[CR]At the title screen, press Up, Down, Left, Right, Left, 2, Up to activate Hard mode. Or press Up, Down, Left, Right, Left, 2, Up, Up, 2, Up to activate Rock hard mode.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Hard Modes[CR]Please do the following at the title screen:[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Infinite Lives[CR]By falling off the first breakfast table on the bottom right hand corner you will gain infinite lives[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Infinite Lives[CR]While on a breakfast table, stop on a puddle of milk and press Up+1+2</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Micro Machines 2: Turbo Tournament added a variety of things to the Micro Machines series. It was the first Micro Machines game in which cars handles differently on each course and the first title in which helicopters and hovercraft featured. The idea behind this was to add variety to the gameplay but the differences in handling where minimal except for the case of the hovercraft which was very tricky to handle.[CR]J-Cart[CR]The famous J-Cart with extra joypad portsThe main addition Micro Machines 2 brought to the table, and the reason the game carried the Turbo Tournament tag was the J-Cart. The J-Cart was a modified game cartridge that as well as storing the game also housed 2 controller ports. This enabled the Genesis version of the game to now accept four controllers instead of the usual two. As Micro Machines 2 races featured 4 racers at a time the makers then decided that for some reason four players would still not be enough. They added the ability for 2 players to play with the same pad, with one player taking the dpad to steer and the other using the face buttons accelerate/bracke their car. In Practice this was always a very amusing way to play as you had to be certain that your fellow player would screw up at the death.[CR]Vehicles[CR] Rally CarsConstruction JeepsBuggysDragstersConvertablesHelecoptersHovercraftsSports carsThree wheeled bikes[CR]</plot>

		<title_clean>Mortal Kombat</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]GET OVER HERE!Mortal Kombat is a 2D fighting game developed and released by Midway in 1992 for arcades. After initial popularity, it was ported to most fourth-generation consoles (in a special event known as "Mortal Monday").The game was controversial due to the combination of excessive gore and violence (including post-battle execution moves known as Fatalities) and fully-digitized character graphics, two concepts that were introduced to the fighting game genre by Mortal Kombat. Originally designed as a video game starring Jean-Claude Van Damme (whose likeness can be seen in the character Johnny Cage), the game introduced a monstrous franchise that spawned a multitude of sequels, a series of comic books, music CDs, a live tour, two television shows, and two major motion pictures (Mortal Kombat and Mortal Kombat Annihilation).The game revolves around the brutal Mortal Kombat tournament held in a hidden island ruled by the evil sorceror Shang Tsung (whose half-dragon, half-human bodyguard, Goro, remains the undefeated champion of the tournament). Each of the seven playable characters enter the tournament for different reasons (some for revenge, while others for glory). The main protagonist is Liu Kang, a Shaolin Monk of the White Lotus society who wants to bring honor back to the Mortal Kombat tournament. The main storyline was expanded through comics and sequels, involving the evil forces of Outworld, who use the tournament in order to take over Earth (known as Earthrealm).[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Arcade button layout in the classic "X" formation.Mortal Kombat plays like a traditional 2D fighting game. The 5-button layout was laid out in an "X" pattern and featured High Punch and Low Punch on the left, High Kick and Low Kick on the right, and a dedicated Block button (a first for 2D fighting games) in the middle. Depending on the distance and joystick position, players can perform uppercuts, roundhouse kicks, backhand punches, and leg sweeps. The game introduced special moves that do not require circular joystick movement or holding the joystick in a certain direction. Scorpion's trademark Spear Throw for instance is performed by tapping away from the opponent on the joystick twice, then pressing the low punch button. The game also introduced special moves that do not require any button presses, such as Raiden's Flying Torpedo, performed by tapping away from the opponent on the joystick twice, then tapping towards the opponent on the joystick once.This is the only fighting game in the franchise to include a scoring system (using points) for its high score table. Players earn points by damaging other players, winning a round, and winning the Test Your Might mini-game. The amount of points for winning the round is based on time, amount of damage taken (taking no damage in a round results in a Flawless Victory bonus, while taking no damage in the second round results in a Double Flawless bonus of 500,000 points), and whether or not the player performs a Fatality (which earns the player 100,000 points).FatalitiesFATALITY!One key feature of the fighting game genre made possible (and famous) by Mortal Kombat is the Fatality, which serves as a glorified finishing move that can only be performed upon a losing player at the end of the final round. Fatalities are special button and joystick combinations that are time-restricted. Failing to perform one usually results in the opponent falling unceremoniously to the ground, with the only penalty being a loss of the Fatality bonus. Goro, Shang Tsung, and Reptile do not perform Fatalities, and likewise players can not perform a Fatality on Goro or Shang Tsung. Other than The Pit Stage Fatality, performing a Fatality earns the player 100,000 points. In some home versions, Fatalities are referred to as "Finishing Moves".Simply performing an uppercut (or performing Liu Kang's Fatality) on The Pit will knock the opponent over the side of the bridge, who will then be impaled through the spikes below. This is not available in the Sega Genesis (without the Blood Code activated), Game Boy, Sega Game Gear, or Sega Master System versions.Test Your MightRaiden chopping a pile of wood for bonus points.Every three matches against the CPU opponent or every five matches against human opponents brings the player(s) to a mini-game called "Test Your Might", which requires each player to repeatedly tap certain buttons to build up a yellow bar (which quickly decreases). Once the bar reaches a certain point, the player presses another button to attempt to chop the object placed in front of them. The required point of breakage and points awarded for a successful chop is increased for each level. (100,000 points for Wood, 200,000 points for Stone, 500,000 points for Steel, 750,000 points for Ruby, and 1,000,000 points for Diamond)[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Character Selection Screen with player one as Kano and player two as Sub-Zero.The game includes seven playable characters and two bosses. After choosing a character, the player progresses through the game by defeating all seven combatants (including a mirror match), then progress through three "endurance matches" (in which players must defeat two opponents consecutively to win a round), and then battle the two bosses: Goro and Shang Tsung.Introduced in later versions of the arcade (and the home console ports) is the unplayable Reptile, the third ninja palette swap with moves of both Scorpion and Sub-Zero. He randomly appears before matches to provide clues on how to reach him. If the player can decipher these hints, they will know that Reptile can be fought by performing a Fatality on The Pit stage without taking damage or blocking in the final round, and even then he will only show himself if a shadow appears over the moon in the background at some point during the match. Defeating him earns the player 10,000,000 points.[CR]Johnny Cage[CR](not available in the Game Boy version)Actor: Daniel PesinaSpecial Moves[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Access the Arcade Mode[CR]To access the arcade mode, please do the following:</plot>

The game introduced special moves that do not require circular joystick movement or holding the joystick in a certain direction. Scorpion's trademark Spear Throw for instance is performed by tapping away from the opponent on the joystick twice, then pressing the low punch button. The game also introduced special moves that do not require any button presses, such as Raiden's Flying Torpedo, performed by tapping away from the opponent on the joystick twice, then tapping towards the opponent on the joystick once.This is the only fighting game in the franchise to include a scoring system (using points) for its high score table. Players earn points by damaging other players, winning a round, and winning the Test Your Might mini-game. The amount of points for winning the round is based on time, amount of damage taken (taking no damage in a round results in a Flawless Victory bonus, while taking no damage in the second round results in a Double Flawless bonus of 500,000 points), and whether or not the player performs a Fatality (which earns the player 100,000 points).FatalitiesFATALITY!One key feature of the fighting game genre made possible (and famous) by Mortal Kombat is the Fatality, which serves as a glorified finishing move that can only be performed upon a losing player at the end of the final round. Fatalities are special button and joystick combinations that are time-restricted. Failing to perform one usually results in the opponent falling unceremoniously to the ground, with the only penalty being a loss of the Fatality bonus. Goro, Shang Tsung, and Reptile do not perform Fatalities, and likewise players can not perform a Fatality on Goro or Shang Tsung. Other than The Pit Stage Fatality, performing a Fatality earns the player 100,000 points. In some home versions, Fatalities are referred to as "Finishing Moves".Simply performing an uppercut (or performing Liu Kang's Fatality) on The Pit will knock the opponent over the side of the bridge, who will then be impaled through the spikes below. This is not available in the Sega Genesis (without the Blood Code activated), Game Boy, Sega Game Gear, or Sega Master System versions.Test Your MightRaiden chopping a pile of wood for bonus points.Every three matches against the CPU opponent or every five matches against human opponents brings the player(s) to a mini-game called "Test Your Might", which requires each player to repeatedly tap certain buttons to build up a yellow bar (which quickly decreases). Once the bar reaches a certain point, the player presses another button to attempt to chop the object placed in front of them. The required point of breakage and points awarded for a successful chop is increased for each level. (100,000 points for Wood, 200,000 points for Stone, 500,000 points for Steel, 750,000 points for Ruby, and 1,000,000 points for Diamond)[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Character Selection Screen with player one as Kano and player two as Sub-Zero.The game includes seven playable characters and two bosses. After choosing a character, the player progresses through the game by defeating all seven combatants (including a mirror match), then progress through three "endurance matches" (in which players must defeat two opponents consecutively to win a round), and then battle the two bosses: Goro and Shang Tsung.Introduced in later versions of the arcade (and the home console ports) is the unplayable Reptile, the third ninja palette swap with moves of both Scorpion and Sub-Zero. He randomly appears before matches to provide clues on how to reach him. If the player can decipher these hints, they will know that Reptile can be fought by performing a Fatality on The Pit stage without taking damage or blocking in the final round, and even then he will only show himself if a shadow appears over the moon in the background at some point during the match. Defeating him earns the player 10,000,000 points.[CR]Johnny Cage[CR](not available in the Game Boy version)Actor: Daniel PesinaSpecial Moves[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Access the Arcade Mode[CR]To access the arcade mode, please do the following:</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR] Raiden decides to take a vacation.[CR]Mortal Kombat 3 (known in some promotional material simply as MK3) is a 2D fighting game developed and released by  Midway on April 1995 for arcades.[CR]Although not as popular as the previous  Mortal Kombat games (and was criticized by fans due to the change of scenery and bland character roster), the game was a commercial success, adding new gameplay innovations to the franchise such as the Run button, different difficulty ladders, pre-programmed combos,  Animalities, mid-fight stage transitions, a new type of Fatality (the Animality) and special pre-match codes known as "Kombat Kodes". The game was later overshadowed by its upgrade:  Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3.[CR]Taking place sometime after  Mortal Kombat II, the plot of Mortal Kombat 3 revolves around the  Outworld Emperor  Shao Kahn's invasion of  Earthrealm through the resurrection of his wife,  Sindel. Other sub-plots include the creation of the ninja clan  Lin Kuei's "cyber-assassin" program (in which  Sub-Zero refuses to join and becomes marked for death) and  Jax and  Sonya's hunt for the elusive  Kano.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR] Mortal Kombat "X" Control Panel with the new run button[CR]The gameplay in Mortal Kombat 3 builds upon the gameplay from the first two Mortal Kombat games. Along with four attack buttons (High Punch, High Kick, Low Punch, Low Kick) and a Block button, the game adds a Run button, which builds upon the offensive game by allowing the player to quickly dash forward. Along with this new button comes a "Run Meter", which limits the use of running.[CR]Mortal Kombat 3 introduces a "chain combo" system in which players can perform pre-programmed combos by linking normal attacks together. These combos cannot be escaped and usually end with either an attack that sends the opponent flying forward, or a launcher that allows the player to further juggle the opponent. Choose Your Destiny![CR]The game also introduces the concept of "Choose Your Destiny", a difficulty selection screen shown before the single player campaign where players can choose between different "towers", each increasing in difficulty. The difficulties included in Mortal Kombat 3 are Novice (in which the player fights six opponents), Warrior (in which the player fights eight opponents), and Master (in which the player fights ten opponents).[CR]In the versus screen before two-player matches, players can cooperatively enter a six-digit code (known as a "Kombat Kode") to modify key gameplay mechanics, fight hidden characters, and read hidden text messages. Gameplay mechanics that could be changed include disabling blocking, disabling throwing, disabling the Run Meter, changing the vitality of a player's life bar, making the screen pitch black, and forcing both players' characters to randomly change every few seconds.[CR]When the  Game Over screen appears after the sole player chooses not to continue, the player the option to enter a ten-digit secret code (known as an "Ultimate Kombat Kode"). Players have little time to input the code (either randomly or figured out through alternate sources). Only one working "Ultimate Kombat Kode" exists in Mortal Kombat 3: the ability to permanently unlock (for that arcade machine) Smoke as a playable character.Finishing MovesANIMALITY![CR] Fatalities,  Friendships, and  Babalities return from Mortal Kombat II. The requirements for performing Friendships and Babalities are now less restrictive (and can only be performed when the player does not press Block during that player's winning round).[CR]Introduced in Mortal Kombat 3 are Mercies and  Animalities. When a player has won a match that went to three rounds, the player has the option to prolong the fight with a special Mercy button combination. (Holding the Run button and pressing Down on the joystick four times when the character is at least a half a screen away) If the player defeats the opponent after showing Mercy, that player has the option to perform an Animality, in which the player transforms into a different animal and kills the opponent. (In a similar fashion to Liu Kang's Dragon Fatality from Mortal Kombat II).[CR]Characters and Actors[CR] The fifteen playable characters (including the space reserved for Smoke)[CR]The game includes fourteen playable starter characters, two unplayable bosses, one playable secret character, and one unplayable secret opponent. Jax, Kung Lao, Liu Kang, Sub-Zero, and Shang Tsung return from Mortal Kombat II alongside Kano and Sonya from the original Mortal Kombat as starting playable characters. Each character from the previous games have a different appearance, such as Jax's metal arms and an un-masked Sub-Zero. Shao Kahn returns from Mortal Kombat II as the game's final boss.[CR]The other playable starter characters include the  palette swaps Cyrax and Sektor (Lin Kuei cyber-assassins sent to kill Sub-Zero), Kabal (a former warrior of Kano's clan), Nightwolf (a North American  shaman), Stryker (a  riot control officer), Sheeva (a female  Shokan warrior), and the resurrected Sindel. Motaro replaces  Kintaro as Shao Kahn's bodyguard and penultimate boss.[CR]The game includes two secret characters, one of which (Smoke from Mortal Kombat II as an indoctrinated cyber-assassin palette swap) is unlocked as a playable character via an "Ultimate Kombat Kode". The other, Noob Saibot (also from Mortal Kombat II), can only be fought through a special "Kombat Kode". Although we're given the impression that Noob Saibot is a ninja (similar to Mortal Kombat II), he is simply a palette swap of Kano in this game. Shang Tsung - John Turk Sindel - Lia Montelongo Jax - John Parrish Kano - Richard Divizio Liu Kang - Eddie Wong Sonya - Kerri Hoskins Stryker - Michael O'Brien Smoke - Sal Divita (secret character) Sub-Zero - John Turk Cyrax - Sal Divita Sektor - Sal Divita Nightwolf - Sal Divita Sheeva - Stop-motion miniature Kung Lao - Anthony Marquez Kabal - Richard Divizio Motaro - Stop-motion miniature (boss, unplayable) Shao Kahn - Brian Glynn (final boss, unplayable) Noob Saibot - Richard Divizio (secret opponent, unplayable)Arenas[CR]There are eleven playable stages (thirteen if Noob Saibot's Dorfen is counted, where the player fights Noob Saibot, and Hidden Portal, where they fight Smoke), which is built into a simple, looping rotation. However, The Balcony is always the stage in Motaro matches and The Pit 3 is always the stage in Shao Kahn matches. The stages that include Stage Fatalities are The Subway (in which the player uppercuts the opponent into the adjacent tracks, who gets run over by a subway car), The Bell Tower (in which the player uppercuts the opponent down the Bell Tower through many floors, who then gets impaled by spikes), and The Pit 3 (in which the player uppercuts the opponent over the side of the bridge and into rotating blades below).[CR]A new addition to Mortal Kombat stages is mid-match stage transitions, where a simple uppercut can knock the opponent up into another stage. The Subway transitions to The Street, The Bank transitions to The Rooftop, and The Soul Chamber transitions to The Balcony. The Subway  The Bank The Street The Graveyard  The Rooftop The Balcony The Bridge The Soul Chamber The Bell Tower The Church The Graveyard The Pit 3[CR]Versions and Ports[CR]16-bit conversions for the Sega Genesis and Super Nintendo were released on September 8, 1995, along with a Game Boy version as well. A rare Game Gear version of MK3 was made but only saw a release in Japan and Europe. MK3 was an early member of the Sony PlayStation library, as a 32-bit conversion was released on October 7, 1995, less than a month after the PlayStation launched in North America. As part of its battle with Sega Saturn over the 32-bit market, Sony bought exclusive rights from Midway to release the game on 32-bit consoles. As a response, Sega purchased exclusive 32-bit rights to Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3. Two versions of MK3 were released for PC. One version was strictly made for DOS. The other version was the PlayStation version ported over for Windows. An emulated version of the game was included on Midway Arcade Teasures 2 for the Xbox, PlayStation 2, and GameCube in 2004. It also was featured on Midway Arcade Treasures: Extended Play for the PSP in 2005 and Midway Arcade Teasures Deluxe Edition for the PC in 2006. Deluxe featured a 1995 10-minute documentary about the making of the game.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Kombat Codes[CR]At the Kombat Code screen, enter the following for the desired effect.</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Advertisement featuring four of the new playable charactersMortal Kombat II is a 2D fighting game developed and released by Midway in 1993 for arcades. Like the previous game, it was ported to numerous fourth-generation consoles (and some fifth-generation ones).It is the direct sequel to the original Mortal Kombat, adding new characters and content while revamping the fighting system for a smoother, faster experience. The game introduced multiple Fatalities (gruesome finishing moves) per character, Babalities (finishing moves that humiliates the opponent by turning their character into a baby), and Friendships (finishing moves that trade brutal punishment for a friendly gesture). The game introduces more easter eggs, including a playable version of Pong and the iconic "Toasty!" sound clip. The score system from the original (as well as the Test Your Might! minigame and endurance matches) has been removed in favor of a tally system that tracks the number of consecutive matches won.Taking place sometime after the events of the last Mortal Kombat tournament, the story shifts the location to an alternate realm called Outworld, where it's emperor, Shao Kahn, plans to take over Earthrealm by defeating the warriors of Earth in a tournament (with the help of his half-tiger, half-human bodyguard, Kintaro, and the restored Shang Tsung). Other sub-plots involve Liu Kang's plan for revenge for the assault of his Shaolin monastery (with the help of his close friend, Kung Lao), Jax's mission to rescue the captured Sonya and Kano, and the tensions between female ninja assassins Kitana and Mileena.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Mortal Kombat II builds upon the original Mortal Kombat's gameplay. The five-button layout (in an "X" formation) returns, with four attack buttons (High Punch, High Kick, Low Punch, and Low Kick) and a dedicated Block button. Some normal attacks have different attributes (for example, roundhouse kicks now launch opponents into the air, whether they are on the ground or not), and crouching punches have been added (in the original game, crouching and pressing either punch causes the character to throw an uppercut).Finishing MovesBaraka performing a gruesome new Fatality: the Blade Lift.One significant addition to Mortal Kombat II is the expansion of each character's arsenal of finishing moves. Each of the twelve playable characters now has two Fatalities (glorified execution moves) instead of one (with the exception of Shang Tsung, who has three). Three stages have special Stage Fatalities: The Dead Pool, The Kombat Tomb, and The Pit II. Unlike the original Mortal Kombat (where the Stage Fatality is done with a simple uppercut), Stage Fatalities must be performed with a unique button combination. The button combination for both The Kombat Tomb and The Pit II are unique for each character, with the button combination for The Dead Pool being universal for all characters.Mortal Kombat II introduces two alternate types of finishing moves: Babalities and Friendships. Babalities humiliate the opponent by turning their character into a baby, while Friendships makes the character show a friendly gesture (from autographing a picture to giving a gift). Both can only be performed if the winning player does not press any of the punch buttons during the winning round.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]The game includes twelve playable characters, two unplayable bosses, and three unplayable secret characters. All of the previous cast returns except Goro, Kano, and Sonya (though Kano and Sonya are seen as chained prisoners in Shao Kahn's Arena). Most of the cast have received new appearances, special moves, and Fatalities. This is the first game where Reptile and Shang Tsung are playable.After choosing a character, the player progresses through the game by defeating all twelve playable characters (with Shang Tsung always being the last opponent), and then battle the two new bosses: Kintaro and Shao Kahn. Unlike the previous game, there are no "endurance matches" or special mini-games.The new playable characters include Kung Lao (a Shaolin Monk and friend of Liu Kang), Jax (a U.S. Special Forces major who is sent to rescue Sonya), the Tarkatan creature Baraka, and the female ninjas Kitana and Mileena. The two boss characters include Shao Kahn (the evil emperor of Outworld) and his bodyguard, Kintaro. Much like the original Mortal Kombat, the game includes three secret opponents that are palette swaps of either the male or female ninjas: Jade (who can only be fought by winning a round using only the Low Kick button in the match before the "?" symbol), Smoke (who can only be fought by waiting for the "Toasty!" indicator on The Portal stage and pressing down on the joystick and the Start button), and Noob Saibot (who can only be fought by winning 50 rounds in a row).

The victim falls to his or her knees before splitting apart down the center in two opposing directions.Fatality 2: Kung Lao throws his hat from a distance with a slight upward arc, catching the victim just under the neck and decapitating him or her.[CR]         Johnny Cage [CR] (not available in the Game Boy, Game Gear, and Sega Master System versions) Actor:  Daniel Pesina Fatality 1: Cage rips the torso off of his victim and tosses it away, leaving only a pair of standing legs.Fatality 2: Cage revisits his fatality from the original game, using an uppercut to decapitate his victim. A special button combination can be executed during the fatality to guarantee that two more heads are punched off (out of thin air, natch).[CR]         Reptile [CR]Actor: Daniel PesinaFatality 1: Reptile removes his mask, revealing his true reptilian face. He then opens wide, snaring the opponent's head with his long tongue, rips it clean off, and eats it.Fatality 2: While invisible, Reptile pops his victim's torso up into the air and away from the legs.[CR]         Sub-Zero[CR]Actor: Daniel Pesina Fatality 1: Sub-Zero freezes his victim in showers of ice. He then executes a powerful uppercut which causes his victim to explode in a shower of guts, legs and arms. Note: This requires two separate inputs: one for the ice shower, and one for the uppercut. The ice shower can be executed and followed up by any other move, including Sub-Zero's other fatality, if so desired.Fatality 2: Sub-Zero generates an "ice grenade" in his hands, hurls it towards his victim, and waits as the grenade blows his victim's torso into pieces--leaving nothing but a pair of standing legs.[CR]         Shang Tsung [CR] (sub-boss) Actor: Philip Ahn M.D. Fatality 1: Shang Tsung enters his victim's body via the ear canal. Shortly thereafter, he "bursts out" of his victim, causing the body to explode.Fatality 2: Shang Tsung lifts his victim into the air with one hand, sucking out the victim's soul into the other hand. What remains of the victim is a shriveled, desiccated body.Hidden Fatality: Shang Tsung morphs into Kintaro and, with one powerful punch, knocks his victim's torso clean off of his/her legs.[CR]         Kitana [CR]Actor:  Katalin Zamiar Fatality 1: Kitana whips out her razor-sharp fan and decapitates her victim.Fatality 2: Kitana plants a lovely kiss on her victim which in fact causes the victim's body to expand to the point of explosion.[CR]      Jax [CR]Actor:  John Parrish Fatality 1: Jax claps both of his hands on the victim's head, causing it to shatter into pieces.Fatality 2: Jax grabs ahold of both of his victim's arms and rips them off with one yank. The victim then stands in shock as showers of blood gush through his/her arm sockets. The victim doesn't immediately die (of blood loss).[CR]         Mileena [CR]Actor: Katalin Zamiar Fatality 1: Mileena pulls out both of her sai and, in rapid-fire style, repeatedly stabs her victim in the torso, leaving behind a massive spray of blood.Fatality 2: Mileena removes her mask, revealing Tarkatan teeth. She then inhales her victim, then turns around and spits out a plethora of shiny bones.[CR]         Baraka [CR] (not available in the Game Boy, Game Gear, and Sega Master System versions) Actor:  Richard Divizio Fatality 1: Baraka decapitates his victim with one swipe of his arm blades.Fatality 2: Baraka unleashes both of his arm blades and impales his victim through the chest. As the victim struggles and slowly dies, his/her body slides down the blades before stopping and hanging in the air.[CR]         Scorpion [CR]Actor: Daniel PesinaFatality 1: Reprising his original Fatality, Scorpion removes his mask, revealing only a ghastly skull. He then breaths a ball of fire at his victim, who then bursts into flame--flesh burning away instantly--before exploding into a shower of flaming bones.Fatality 2: Scorpion takes the blade of his spear and slashes open his victim's jugular. As a long river of blood spurts through the neck, Scorpion then follows it up by slicing and separating his victim's torso from the legs.[CR]         Raiden [CR] (known as Rayden in some home versions, not available in the Game Boy, Game Gear, and Sega Master System versions) Actor:  Carlos Pesina Fatality 1: Raiden unleashes a powerful uppercut which shatters his victim's body into pieces.Fatality 2: Raiden grabs ahold of and shocks his victim until the body explodes.[CR]        Kintaro [CR](sub-boss, unplayable)[CR]        Shao Kahn [CR](boss, unplayable)[CR]Actor:  Brian Glynn [CR]        Jade [CR](secret opponent, unplayable)[CR]Actor: Katalin Zamiar[CR]        Smoke [CR](secret opponent, unplayable)[CR]Actor: Daniel Pesina[CR]       Noob Saibot [CR](secret opponent, unplayable, not available in the Game Boy, Game Gear, and Sega Master System versions)[CR]Actor: Daniel Pesina[CR]Arenas[CR]There are nine playable stages, which are built into a simple, looping rotation. However, Shao Kahn's Arena is always the stage in Kintaro and Shao Kahn matches. The stages that include special Stage Fatalities are The Dead Pool (where the player uppercuts the opponent into acid), The Kombat Tomb (where the player uppercuts the opponent into previously hidden ceiling spikes), and The Pit II (where the player uppercuts the opponent off the side of the bridge and into the rocky ground below). The Dead PoolThe Living Forest The Kombat Tomb The Wasteland The Tower The Living Forest  The Armory The Pit II The Portal Shao Kahn's Arena [CR]Versions and Ports[CR]The original release of Mortal Kombat II on the Midway T-Unit arcade board went through four released revisions (1.1, 1.4, 2.1, and 3.1). While revisions 1.1 and 1.4 were available to the public, they were considered unfinished, missing some Fatalities, some special moves, all endings, all Friendships, all Babalities, all secret opponents, and all Stage Fatalities. Revision 3.1 is the final version, featuring all Fatalities, special moves, endings, Friendships, Babalities, secret opponents, Stage Fatalities, and bugfixes. The arcade release was considered a smash hit, with special guards on the arcade machines to protect the arcade board from being stolen.Almost a year later, the game was ported to various consoles. Home versions hit the market on &#8220;Mortal Friday&#8221; September 10, 1993 for the Sega Genesis, Super Nintendo, Nintendo Game Boy, and Sega Game Gear. The SNES version of the original Mortal Kombat was criticized for its lack of blood, so blood was included in the SNES version of MKII. It was featured in the launch library for the Sega 32X when it launched in November 1994. Versions for the PC and Amiga were released in late-1994 as well. Rare versions of the game were released for the Sony PlayStation and Sega Saturn in 1996. The PlayStation version was released only in Japan, and featured excessive loading times. For example, if Shang Tsung morphed into another character, the game would pause mid-match to load this new character, then pause for each consecutive move that required new animations or sound to load in.The original arcade release was later included in Midway Arcade Treasures 2 for the GameCube, PlayStation 2, and Xbox, Midway Arcade Treasures Deluxe Edition for the PC, Midway Arcade Treasures: Extended Play for the PlayStation Portable, and Mortal Kombat Arcade Kollection for the Xbox 360 (via Xbox Live Arcade), PlayStation 3 (via PlayStation Network), and PC (via Steam). The game was also included as an unlockable in Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox.On April 12, 2007, the game was released on the PlayStation 3 as a downloadable title on the PlayStation Network for $4.99, featuring online play.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Fight Smoke[CR]When ''Toasty'' appears in the bottom-right, press Punch+Up.

		<title_clean>Ms. Pac-Man</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The idea of Ms. Pac-Man did not come from Namco, but from hackers. The first version of Ms. Pac-Man was created in 1981 by a handful of programmers at General Computer Corporation. The programmers took a Pac-Man cabinet and modified it, calling it Crazy Otto.[CR]The programmers showed it to Midway who were both surprised at the quality of Crazy Otto and were getting upset over the long wait between the original Pac-Man and its sequel. Midway bought the rights for Crazy Otto and added the Pac-Man sprites and iconic name Ms. Pac-Man to the previously bootlegged game.[CR]Namco quickly took note of Ms. Pac-Man's swiftly growing popularity. Midway had not received consent from Namco to publish the game and a legal battle was about to erupt. Fearing a case would be brought against them, Midway and GCC turned over the rights for Ms. Pac-Man to Namco. Afterward, Namco created numerous ports for the home consoles while benefiting from the widely popular arcade game that was quickly becoming a cultural phenomenon in its own right.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Ms. Pac-Man's gameplay does not stray much from Pac-Man's simple mechanics of eating pellets, numerous types of fruit, and power pellets to eat ghosts. However there are a few major changes that would change the gameplay experience between both games.The first such change is that the three intermissions in the game are changed to tell the story of Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man's relationship from dating all the way to a stork dropping off their baby.The second change is a minor one; the changing of the orange ghost's name from Clyde to Sue.The ghosts now have movements that are semi-random. Because of this, many players have learned to use a set of moves to avoid the ghosts.The fruit no longer appears and stays in the center of the maze. It instead enters from one tunnel of the maze, travels around, and leaves through the other tunnel if not eaten by the player.The fruit order is now cherries, strawberry, orange, pear, apple, pretzel, and banana. The score for each is also 100, 200, 500, 700, 1000, 2000, and 5000 respectively.The final change is that there are six different mazes. With each of the mazes there are four different colors or styles. Each maze also now has two warp tunnels that will transport the player to the opposite side of the maze.The walls are now filled in (Pac-Man had hollow walls).[CR]</plot>

		<plot>Nazo Puyo (Secret Puyo) takes the "Quest mode" found in many Puyo Puyo games and breaks it off into a game of its own. Whereas the usual Puyo Puyo gameplay is centred around beating an opponent by having a more skillful play technique, the puzzle mode (and all Nazo Puyo) games is a leisurly puzzle game where you have to fulfill a set goal on a screen already filled with a certain arrangement of Puyos.[CR]These goals may be to simply eliminate all Puyos on-screen, to eliminate all Puyos of a certain colour, or to eliminate a certain number of Puyos at once. You may also be asked to do a "rensa", or chain reaction, in a certain number of steps. A "rensa" is arranged by making so that if one set of four or more Puyos is eliminated, it will make neighbouring Puyos fall so that new combinations arise, and are eliminated. The fulfillment of the goals may be complicated by the fact that you are given only Puyos of a certain colour to work with.[CR]The game has also an edit mode, where you can make your own puzzles given all the options described above.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Quest Mode Passwords[CR]Enter any of the following passwords after selecting Continue in Quest Mode:[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Quest Mode Passwords[CR]Legend:[CR]R = Red Bean[CR]Y = Yellow Bean[CR]G = Green Bean[CR]B = Blue Bean[CR]P = Purple Bean[CR]C = Clear (Refugee) Bean[CR]H = Has Bean</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Nazo Puyo: Arle no Roux (sometimes romanized as "Aruru no Ruu") is the third entry in the Nazo Puyo series, a set of Puyo Puyo spinoffs that has the player completing various challenges instead of battling opponents in head-to-head gameplay. Unlike the previous entries in the series, Arle no Roux includes an adventure mode, where various Madou Monogatari characters give heroine Arle Nadja challenges to complete. The game modifies many of Nazo Puyo's game rules, and received a graphical overhaul that would later be used in the Game Gear port of Puyo Puyo Tsu.[CR]A remake of Arle no Roux is included in Super Nazo Puyo: Rulue no Roux.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]There are two modes in Arle no Roux: Nazo Puyo and Toko Puyo. Toko Puyo is the Endless mode of other Puyo Puyo games, where the player matches Puyo until their third-from-left column is filled.[CR]Nazo Puyo is the main mode. Players take control of Arle Nadja, who walks around a city and receives challenges from other characters. Each challenge consists of several pre-made boards, each with a condition to fulfill and a list of Puyo that are available to Arle. Unlike the previous Nazo Puyo games, which would endlessly give the player Puyo after all of the preset pairs were dropped, Arle no Roux will "damage" Arle once she has run out of Puyo; the challenge then restarts.[CR]As a reference to the Madou Monogatari series, the number of retries that the player has remaining is determined by Arle's facial expressions. She appears cheerful at first, but will become more distraught each time that she fails. When Arle grits her teeth, the next failure will result in a Game Over. Arle's status carries over between challenge sets, and can only be improved by leveling up. Several orbs are placed on the screen (again, a reference to Madou Monogatari) and fill whenever Arle completes a challenge. When all of them are full, Arle becomes cheerful again, replenishing the player's retries.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Quest Mode Passwords[CR]Enter any of the following passwords after selecting Continue in Quest Mode:[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Quest Mode Passwords[CR]Legend:[CR]R = Red Bean[CR]Y = Yellow Bean[CR]G = Green Bean[CR]B = Blue Bean[CR]P = Purple Bean[CR]C = Clear (Refugee) Bean[CR]H = Has Bean</plot>

		<title_clean>NBA Jam</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]NBA Jam is a basketball arcade game developed and released by Midway in 1993. It is the first entry in the NBA Jam series and became exceptionally popular in arcades, generating over $1 billion in revenue for the company. Mark Turmell is the game's main programmer and designer, and its gameplay is based on the game Arch Rivals, which Midway released in 1989.[CR]Due to the success of NBA Jam, an updated version of the game called NBA Jam Tournament Edition was released a year and a half later. Featuring updated rosters and adding a number of new features to the series. Midway also used the success of NBA Jam to apply the over-the-top nature of the game to other sports. For example, Midway went on to create NFL Blitz, an over-the-top version of American football, in 1997.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]NBA Jam is a 2-on-2 arcade-style basketball game that features over-the-top gameplay. The exaggerated nature of the gameplay means that players can perform gravity defying dunks with ease and shove opposing players down without penalty. Each game consists of four 3 minute long quarters, and the team with the most points at the end of the fourth quarter wins the game. When starting a match players have the option to enter their initials in order to keep track of their win-loss record and teams that they have beaten.[CR]The only fouls a player can commit in NBA Jam are goal tending and shot clock violations. This means that the player can shove opposing players (and even his own teammate) down in order to get the ball without commiting a foul. A shot clock is present in order to keep the game moving at a fast pace and goal tending is used to prevent players from hoarding the basket while on defense.[CR]A trademark of the NBA Jam series is the ability for players to catch on fire. This occurs when a player makes three consecutive unanswered shots. While on fire the player is nearly unstoppable; the player is granted unlimited turbo, increased accuracy, and can't be called for goal tending. A player's fire goes out when the opposing team makes a basket.[CR][B]Teams:[/B][CR]*Note: The arcade version features teams from the 92-93 NBA season, while the home version include players from the 93-94 season. Shaq only appears in the arcade version of the game, he does not appear in the home versions of the game because the cost to renew the right to license him was deemed too high.[CR] Easter EggsDra&#382;en Petrovi&#263; haunts the arcade version of NBA Jam, allegedly.Dra&#382;en Petrovi&#263; died in a car accident between the game's home version port. It is believed that he haunts the arcade version of the game by causing the announcer to call his name out at random.NBA Jam is well known for featuring many odd hidden characters that can be unlocked via the game's initial entry. The home versions of the game added "celebrity" characters, while the arcade release focused more on the team responsible for developing the game. Unlockable players include:Bill ClintonAl GoreSal DivitaMark TurmellNBA Jam also includes cheats that enhance a players stats, these include: always on fire, infinite turbo and super dunks.[CR]</plot>

		<title_clean>NBA Jam - Tournament Edition</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]NBA Jam Tournament Edition is the second game in Midway&#8217;s basketball arcade series, featuring two-on-two fast paced matches with NBA players from the 1993-94 season (1994-95 on consoles). In total, the game features over 120 NBA athletes and over 40 hidden characters. Improvements include additional power-ups, more detailed player attributes, player substitutions after each quarter, and a new soundtrack. The namesake "Tournament Mode" turns off all cheats and power-ups, and rewards players with expanded rosters for nearly all teams if the player beats all 27 teams.[CR]In addition to these features, console releases added practice and &#8220;juice&#8221; modes, optional game toggles like "hotspots" and power-up icons, and an "injury" stat that lowers a character's stats. Later console releases (Jaguar, Saturn, PlayStation) also featured larger character sprites and scaling effects to match those of the Arcade version.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The core gameplay is largely unchanged from the original NBA Jam. Players still have the ability to do all the crazy dunks from the original, and all actions (running, passing, shooting) can be enhanced by holding down the "Turbo" button. Turbo drains while active, and replenishes quickly when not in use. Players also have the series-staple ability to go on fire after making 3 unanswered scores in a row - giving the player temporary unlimited sprint and the ability to goal tend without being penalized. Small, but significant changes in the T.E. include slightly improved A.I., game speed, new dunks, and court changes matching the color of the home team. Up to four players can play at once, with the A.I. filling in any empty slots.More stats in the T.E.[CR]The most significant changes in the Tournament Edition are expanding each player's stats, and expanding each team's roster to three players (with some exceptions due to trades or retirement, such as Dallas, which only has two players). Players are graded from 0 to 9 in eight categories: Speed, Dunk, 3-Point, Block, Power, Clutch, and Pass. Stats directly affect a player's success for each particular action, and players can be substituted out at halftime to respond to the changing needs of the game. For example, the player can send in a player with high Power and Pass ratings if ahead, to minimize getting shoved or picked and secure their lead. If trailing in the 4th, send in players with a high Clutch rating. These changes bring an added level of strategy somewhat missing from the original.[CR]Every version of the game also contains the Tournament Mode, where all cheats, power-ups, and special characters are disabled. Players are challenged to beat all 27 NBA teams, with progress stored to their initials (inputted at the start of the game). If a player beats all challenging teams, they unlock new characters and challenges. In the Arcade version, this unlocked the "???" team for play, consisting of NBA All-Stars and secret characters. These characters would also populate opposing teams, and always come with the "Quick Hands" and "Max Power" power-ups (except in Tournament Mode). On consoles, beating Tournament Mode unlocks 2 new players for almost every team's roster, plus a new difficulty level.[CR]All versions of the game also include "Power-up" codes to input at the Tonight's Matchup screen. These are secret combinations of button presses and stick moves that grant abilities akin to cheats (such as infinite turbo and power dunks). Playing in Tournament Mode disables these.[CR]An owner dipswitch option in the Arcade allowed the winning team out of a game of four players to continue playing for free, adding extra incentive to beat any challengers lined up.ConsolesHotspots enabled[CR]Some additional modes were added for console releases, and could be individually toggled in the options screen off the main menu. "Hot Spots" place marked circles randomly around the court and reward the player with extra points (up to a 9-point shot) for sinking a basket while standing inside them. Each spot clearly displays its value within the circle. "Power-up" icons add randomly-appearing icons around the court that bestow an effect when touched (such as enhanced accuracy, instant "on fire," or an earthquake knocking down all other players). Finally, some releases included a "Juice" mode that increased the game's speed by a factor of four. Once again, playing in Tournament Mode disables all of these.[CR]The console releases also added an "Injury" stat for each player. This stat increases as the player is repeatedly shoved to the ground, and decrease all his other stats proportionally. Substitutions are also increased for each quarter, encouraging injured players to be swapped out for a quarter and come back refreshed. It also adds a further layer of possible tactics, as a strong player could be shut down with repeated shoving.[CR]Console releases also include an optional "Tag Mode" where the player always control the athlete holding the ball. Passing to a player switches control to that player as soon as the ball connects. This mode can be helpful for anyone not content with the A.I. teammate's handling and decisions.Computer AI Analysis[CR]The computer artificial intelligence seems to have two different modes. In one mode (mostly seen in early tournament matches) the computer adopts a more passive defensive strategy. They will rarely ever try to push the player over, and the player can often simply run the length of the court and put up a three, or go for an easy dunk without ever worrying about passing. On offense, they tend to often go for three pointers, and will almost always make them if the player doesn't steal or block the ball first (especially if the player is ahead in score). The AI will rarely ever go inside the paint for a lay up or a dunk in this mode.[CR]In the second mode (mostly seen in later tournament matches) the computer is much more aggressive. They will often try to push the player over, making it almost impossible to progress the ball up the length of the court without passing the ball to the other player frequently. Also, if the player tries to put up a three, they will almost always get shoved by the opposing computer controlled AI player if he is nearby. This makes it hard to get three pointers up, and the player can end up getting pummeled if they do not pass frequently. On offense, the AI will frequently go for dunks and attack the paint. However, if the player leaves them wide open on the perimeter they will pull up a three and make it almost all the time.[CR]In general, AI in the first mode is much easier to deal with than the aggressive second mode. The one advantage the first mode has to the second mode is on the offensive side because they will often go for three pointers and will make them almost all the time meaning they can come back quickly if the player is sloppy on the offensive end. However, because of the second modes extremely aggressive defensive, it is more often than not much harder to deal with. Though if the player can manage to get a huge lead on them, it is a lot harder for this mode to make a come back because they often don't put up three pointers.Always going for dunks is a good strategy when in the lead[CR]However, it is hard to get a big lead on either types of AI because of the Rubber Band AI effect. As the player's lead grows, the probability of making shots becomes progressively lower, while the AI's probability of success progressively increases. One strategy to deal with this is to always go for dunks after starting to get a lead bigger than two possessions (4 points), because dunks have a very high probability of going in. Likewise, never go for three pointers because the probability of a three pointer going in is very small when the player has a lead. Also increasing the defense on the perimeter is recommended because the computer's probability of making a three pointer when the player has a big lead is nearly 100%. This is why the second computer AI mode is easier to get a big lead on because they tend to not go for three pointers and have tougher defense on the perimeter than they do in the paint.[CR]It is interesting to note that if, in the last seconds before half-time or the end of the match, the computer has the ball and they throw up a full court shot it will always go in (a 100% probability) regardless of the score, but if they advance the ball to half court and shoot it from there their probability of making the shot is significantly reduced. For the player, the probability of making a full court shot is very small, giving the computer a competitive edge at the end of the game. Also in the last ten seconds before halftime or the end of the game the computer will become extremely aggressive (even more so than the second AI mode) regardless of the type of AI the player may be facing. If the player has the ball the computer will sprint full speed towards him/her and try to steal the ball and take a quick shot. So if the player is not careful, the computer can score 4 or 6 points in the final 10 seconds using quick steals and shots.[CR]Teams and Players[CR]NBA Team RostersKevin WillisAtlanta Hawks: Stacey Augmon, Mookie Blaylock, Kevin WillisBoston Celtics: Dee Brown, Dino Radja, Dominique Wilkins ( Xavier McDaniel, Eric Montross)Charlotte Hornets: Muggsy Bogues, Larry Johnson, Alonzo Mourning ( Dell Curry, Hersey Hawkins)Chicago Bulls: B.J.

Players would hear the occasional "TOUCHDOWN!" It's also key to mention that even though the game featured rosters from 1994, you had the option to start a season with the '93 and '92 rosters as well.[CR]NFL 95 also featured classic teams as well as "all star teams" based on regions of the country.[CR]The game featured Free Agency, Create-A-Player (which allowed players to create a 21-year-old rookie and adjust his vital statistic.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Random Cheats[CR]On the cheat screen enter these codes.</plot>

While this version does still feature a full NFL license and a full season mode, the number of plays that can be called have been reduced compared to it's console cousins and there are only seven players per team on the field as well as the absence of Practice mode.[CR]Additionally, there are only actual players numbers instead of their names and the QB challenge, which is a staple of the series is absent as well. There is also a password feature that allows the player to pick up and play at their leisure.</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]NHL Hockey was the first entry in a franchise that is now nearly two decades old,  EA's NHL series.  The game provided a much more realistic game than most (if not all) other ice hockey video games available until its release.   NHL Hockey was the first  NHL-licensed title on the  Genesis and  SNES, as well as the first game with an official NHL license since the 1980  Intellivision game  NHL Hockey.  The Intellivision title was merely NHL-branded for marketing and featured no official teams in the game.  EA's NHL Hockey does, however, feature licensed teams and logos. [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The gameplay in NHL Hockey is similar to the game's successors.  Players can pass, shoot, and hit, as well as fight.  Fights will occasionally break out after hits and, unlike other games like  Blades of Steel, award no real advantage to the winner of the bout.  The camera perspective is EA's characteristic vertical-scrolling view, rather than most other hockey games of the time which adopted a TV broadcast style.  [CR]EA Hockey[CR]The European release of the game was re-titled as EA Hockey and did not feature the NHL license.  As a result, the teams in the game were national teams.  However, the teams were merely cosmetic skins of the NHL teams featured in the North American product.[CR]</plot>

When Ryu learns of this, he embarks on a quest to find out who killed his father and why. This quest takes him to America to find an archaeologist with whom Ryu's father was working. From there, Ryu becomes embroiled in an evil, supernatural conspiracy involving a villain named Jaquio who has plans to use an ancient castle and some relics to unleash a terrifying evil upon the world.[CR]Ninja Gaiden is a side scrolling game where Ryu the ninja can run, jump, and slash with his ninja sword. He can also attach to any vertical surface. Powerups are littered throughout the landscape that allow Ryu to toss fireballs and ninja stars, and perform other feats.[CR]Ryu will battle through urban city settings, forests, jungles, snow covered castles, underground railroads, and ancient castles. A major feature in Ninja Gaiden are the cinematic scenes -- sometimes fullscreen -- through which the storyline unfolds.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Cheat Passwords[CR]At the Title Screen and when the text Press Start Button is displayed, press the 1 button 16 times and then press Start.

		<plot>Bruno is a baby Ottifant. It's an ordinary evening, and Bruno's dad is working late at office. Reason enough for Bruno's vivid imagination to run riot, thinking that his dad has been kidnapped by aliens! Jelly babies, that fell from his father's pocket on the way to work, blaze a trail to the office. Now it's up to Bruno to fight his way through hordes of terrorizing toys, Ottifant-eating plants, tear through gloomy caverns of doom and cut across a perilous jungle - workaday objects and boringly normal settings as seen through kids' eyes - and rescue his dad![CR]The Ottifants for the SEGA Game Gear is a 2D side-scrolling platformer where the player controls Bruno through five worlds: starting with the house and the basement, through to the building site, the office and finally the jungle, whereas each world is in turn divided into three stages. Bruno's primary weapon is his trunk, which gives him the ability to blast enemies by firing sweets at them, or suck in objects like out-of-reach platforms or boxes by holding down the Fire-button. Furthermore, yellow, green and red lollies are spread throughout the stages. Gathering three of them activate one of Bruno's special skills and can - depending on the colour combination - transform the baby Ottifant into Superfant with the ability to fly, boost his speed with Speedy Shoes, give an extra Continue and more. [CR]Picking up jelly babies, blasting enemies and collecting papers gives points and raises Bruno's score up to a fixed value of 9,999 pts. There are several entrances to secret rooms hidden in the five worlds. But, unlike the Genesis-version, the rooms are quite small and basic and there is no 1,000 point reward by completing them. On the whole there are two different tunes backing your journey through the game: one for the stages and one for the boss enemies. The varied background music and sound effects of the Genesis-game are completely missing, as is one entire world: The Garden.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Enables Level Skip.[CR]Pause the game, hold down both buttons 1 and 2 and unpause the game to skip a level.</plot>

		<title_clean>Out Run</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR]Development[CR]The inspiration behind the development of OutRun was born out of two things. The first was to overturn Namco, the developer (at the time) of the hugely successful Pole Position and a company synonymous with racing titles, to make Sega Japan's leading manufacturer of racing games. The second, surprisingly, was Yu Suzuki's love of the Burt Reynolds movie Cannonball Run. Suzuki states "The main impetus behind OutRun's creation was my love of a film called Cannonball Run. I thought it would be good to make a game like that."[CR]Suzuki took the development process very seriously and wanted to visit the locations where the courses and levels of his game would pass through. The film Cannonball Run is a pan-American road-race and Suzuki made plans to follow the same course and collect photographic, video and audio data along the way. However, he quickly realized there was a problem:[CR]"The film crosses America, so I made a plan to follow the same course and collect data as I went. But I realized, once I'd arranged everything, that the scenery along the course actually doesn't change very much so I revised my plan and decided to collect data in Europe instead..."[CR]Innovations[CR]OutRun departed significantly from Namco's popular Pole Position formula. This is most significant in how OutRun moved the setting away from the racing circuits towards the streets, with oncoming traffic, making it the first true street racing game, paving the way for modern street racers such as Need For Speed and Burnout.Force Feedback[CR]There were four versions of the OutRun arcade cabinet, Deluxe and Standard moving models, an upright with a force-feedback wheel and a cockpit version without any movement.[CR]The early classic Arcade machine for OutRun, featured force-feedback. If the side of a wall was hit the player would get a slight jolt, but completely wipe out and reveal the mistake to everyone else present. The rumble brought a sense of immersion that most other arcade games lacked at the time.Multiple Paths[CR]OutRun also featured a unique way to play through the game. At the end of each area (or checkpoint) the road would fork left and right. The way the player chose to go would decide if the next track is more difficult or less difficult. Some areas and paths were much more difficult than others, so it is best to choose wisely. Each path features different endings, most of which are often humorous.Gradient[CR]Out Run was the first racing game to introduce the use of gradients, with the car climbing uphill and downhill along the course. The camera angle through which the player views the car was also significantly lower than other racing games, with a more over-the-shoulder viewpoint directly behind the car, giving it the feel of being in a car where the driver cannot see what is above or below a certain gradient, thus keeping the players always on their toes and bringing more excitement to the gameplay. The game was praised for these innovations.[CR]Success[CR]The game's main competitor in 1986 was rival Konami's more traditional WEC Le Mans, which was initially the favourite at the time for its more sophisticated hydraulic cabinet. It was OutRun, however, which went on to become the much more popular game, selling more than 20,000 arcade cabinets worldwide, for hundreds of millions of dollars, along with ports to numerous home platforms.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Have Unlimited Time[CR]During the Title Screen press: </plot>

		<title_clean>Pac-Attack</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Pac-Attack is a  Pac-Man spin-off, in the same vein as  Tetris and/or  Dr Mario. It is based somewhat on Namco's earlier game Cosmo Gang: The Puzzle, an Arcade and Super Famicom game released the previous year.[CR]Pac-Attack has been released on many different systems. The original version was released on the Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis in late 1993, closely followed by the Game Boy and Game Gear versions. An enhanced port was released on the Philips CD-i with the name Pac-Panic. It has also been released in many Namco and Pac-Man compilations, and the SNES version was rereleased on the Wii's Virtual Console.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR] Pac-Attack Screen[CR]The object of the game is to clear rows of blocks by getting them into straight lines; however, most of the falling puzzle pieces also have ghosts attached which take up valuable space where blocks could be stored. The solution to this problem is Pac-Man himself. Every once in a while a Pac-Man piece will fall, and all the ghosts on the board will turn blue. If the Pac-Man piece is situated in an area where he can easily catch any ghosts he will remove them from the grid.[CR]The game offers a standard "Normal Mode" in which the game plays out as described above, as well as a "Puzzle" mode in which the player is given a limited number of Pac-Man to eat the various ghosts.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]When the SNES version was released Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the review scores of 8,7,7,8 and 8 out of ten. Mike Weigand wrote, "No, don't laugh, just try it! This game looks like nothing but once you start playing you will not be able to stop! The three games are addictive, and the two-player competition will have you and a friend playing until you drop!".[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level Passwords[CR]On the password screen, enter the following passwords to start at the desired level:</plot>

		<title_clean>Pac-Man</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]An important icon of arcade gamingOriginally titled Puck Man, Pac-Man hit the arcade scene first in Japan when Namco released it on May 22, 1980. Shortly after receiving a lukewarm response, the game was released in the U.S. by Midway. Compared to other arcade hits in the early '80s, such as Space Invaders, Galaxian, Defender, and Asteroids, Pac-Man put a friendlier face on its bizarre action and thus had the ability to appeal to a much broader audience. Toru Iwatani has said that he was looking for a way to attract women into arcades, which at the time were almost exclusively male locations. Having discarded ideas for a fashion based game and a love simulator, he had a eureka moment after a meal with his girlfriend. He noticed she ate a lot of dessert. Iwatani realized then that eating was a universal concept which he could exploit in a game.The game was considered a smash hit in the U.S. and spawned many sequels and spin-offs, including an animated television show (known as Pac-Man: The Animated Series), a breakfast cereal, and the song Pac-Man Fever by Buckner &amp; Garcia. Not to mention NFL star, Adam "Pac-Man" Jones, and eight-weight boxing champion, Manny "Pac-Man" Pacquaio.The original Pac-Man game was ported to various systems, including the Atari 2600, Atari 5200, NES, PC, Apple II, Game Boy, Game Boy Color, Game Boy Advance, Game Gear, Commodore 64, Atari 8-bit, Intellivision, MSX, NEC PC-6001, NEC PC-8801, FM-7, Sharp X1, Commodore VIC-20, ZX Spectrum, Neo Geo Pocket Color, mobile phones, iPhone, and iPod. The game was also released as an Xbox Live Arcade game under the Xbox Live Marketplace. That version was also included in the compilation disc Namco Museum: Virtual Arcade. The NES version was also re-released for the Game Boy Advance under its Classic NES Series program and for the Nintendo Wii in its Wii Virtual Console platform. The arcade version was re-released as a secret game under the Ms. Pac-Man and Galaga 20 Year Reunion cabinet (in the game selection screen, move the joystick up, up, up, down, down, down, left, right, left, right, left, and press both start buttons before inserting tokens). In celebration of the 25th anniversary of Pac-Man the cabinet was re-released with Pac-Man freely playable. The arcade version was also bundled with compilation discs such as Microsoft Return of Arcade, Microsoft Return of Arcade Anniversary Edition, Namco Museum Vol. 1 for the PlayStation, Namco Museum 64 for the Nintendo 64, Namco Museum for the Dreamcast, PlayStation 2, Xbox, and GameCube, Namco Museum: 50th Anniversary for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, and GameCube, Namco Museum DS for the Nintendo DS, Namco Museum Battle Collection for the PSP, and Namco Museum Essentials for the PlayStation Network (PS3).The infamous 2600 port of Pac-ManThe Atari 2600 port is infamous for being considered one of the worst video games ever created. Having a very short development time frame and a very small staff, Pac-Man for 2600 wound up being a failed attempt at bringing an arcade classic home. Alongside E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial, it can be considered a major factor in the collapse of Atari, Inc. as well as the Video Game Crash of 1983. [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Toru Iwatani, creator of Pac-ManThe basic premise of the game involves the character, Pac-Man, a yellow circle with a slice cut out for a mouth. It's said by developer Toru Iwatani to represent a pizza with one missing slice as well as the general idea of a mouth eating. The player controls Pac-Man through a seemingly-endless amount of mazes, collecting pellets (or "dots") for points while avoiding the four ghosts (Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Clyde, each with their own unique movement patterns). If the player runs into any of the ghosts, the player loses a life. However, the player can run into a power pellet, which make the ghosts temporarily edible for points. This ability, which most players would consider fundamental to Pac-Man, was absent from the game until mid-way through development as Toru Iwatani and his team were fed up being constantly chased and decided to turn the tables on the ghosts.Players can also get bonus fruit pieces which show up at random intervals in each level. The primary goal is to maneuver around the level and eat up all the pellets without losing lives.Veterans of this game noticed patterns about the four ghosts and have developed movement patterns for each level that guarantee success. While hypothetically there is no ending to this game, level 256 is considered a kill screen. A bug in the routine on level 256 eliminates most of the pellets on the right side of the screen, replacing them and the maze with garbled text and graphics. It is impossible to clear that level legitimately. Because this level marks an end-point, the game can have a "perfect play" where the player achieves the maximum possible score on the first 255 levels without losing a single life and then scoring as many points as possible on the kill screen before losing all his lives. The maximum score possible in this game is 3,333,360 points. The first person to achieve this score was Billy Mitchell on July 3, 1999.[CR]Development[CR]The game was developed primarily by a young Namco employee named T&#333;ru Iwatani over the course of a year, beginning in April 1979, employing a nine-man team. It was based on the concept of eating, and the original Japanese title was Pakkuman (&#12497;&#12483;&#12463;&#12510;&#12531;), inspired by the Japanese onomatopoeic slang phrase paku-paku taberu (&#12497;&#12463;&#12497;&#12463;&#39135;&#12409;&#12427;), where paku-paku describes (the sound of) the mouth movement when widely opened and then closed in succession.Although Iwatani has repeatedly stated that the character's shape was inspired by a pizza missing a slice, he admitted in a 1986 interview that this was a half-truth and the character design also came from simplifying and rounding out the Japanese character for mouth, kuchi (&#21475;). Iwatani attempted to appeal to a wider audience&#8212;beyond the typical demographics of young boys and teenagers. His intention was to attract girls to arcades because he found there were very few games that were played by women at the time. This led him to add elements of a maze, as well as cute monster enemy characters. Eating to gain power, Iwatani has said, was a concept he borrowed from Popeye. The result was a game he named Puck Man as a reference to the main character's hockey puck shape.Later in 1980, the game was picked up for manufacture in the United States by Bally division Midway, which changed the game's name from Puck Man to Pac-Man in an effort to avoid vandalism. The cabinet artwork was also changed and the pace and level of difficulty increased to appeal to Western audiences.[CR]Impact and Legacy[CR]Immensely popular from its original release to the present day, Pac-Man is considered one of the classics of the medium, virtually synonymous with video games, and an icon of 1980s popular culture. Upon its release, the game &#8211; and subsequent Pac-Man derivatives &#8211; became a social phenomenon that sold a large amount of merchandise and also inspired, among other things, an animated television series and a top-ten hit single.When Pac-Man was released, the most popular arcade video games were space shooters, Space Invaders being the most popular. The most visible minority were sports games that were mostly derivatives of Pong. Pac-Man succeeded by creating a new genre and appealing to both genders. Pac-Man is often credited with being a landmark in video game history, and is among the most famous arcade games of all time. It is also one of the highest-grossing video games of all time, having generated more than $2.5 billion in quarters by the 1990s.When first launched in Japan by Namco in 1980, the game received a lukewarm response, as Space Invaders and other similar games were more popular at the time. However, the game found far more success in North America. Pac-Man&#8202;'&#8203;s success in North America took competitors and distributors completely by surprise in 1980. Marketing executives who saw Pac-Man at a trade show prior to release completely overlooked the game (along with the now classic Defender), while they looked to a racing car game called Rally-X as the game to outdo that year. The appeal of Pac-Man was such that the game caught on immediately with the public; it quickly became far more popular than anything seen in the game industry up to that point. Pac-Man outstripped Asteroids as the best-selling arcade game in North America, grossing over $1 billion in quarters in its first year, surpassing the revenues grossed by the highest-grossing filmStar Wars.It sold more than 350,000 arcade cabinets (retailing at around $2400 each) for $1 billion within 18 months (inflation adjusted: $2.86 billion in 2014). By 1982, the game had sold 400,000 arcade machines worldwide and an estimated 7 billion coins had been inserted into Pac-Man machines. In addition, United States revenues from Pac-Man licensed products (games, T-shirts, pop songs, wastepaper baskets, etc.) exceeded $1 billion (inflation adjusted: $2.86 billion in 2014). The game was also estimated to have had 30 million active players across the United States in 1982.Towards the end of the 20th century, the game's total gross in quarters had been estimated by Twin Galaxies at more than 10 billion quarters ($2.5 billion), making it the highest-grossing video game of all time (inflation adjusted: $7.16 billion in 2014). In January 1982, the game won the overall Best Commercial Arcade Game award at the 1981 Arcade Awards. In 2001, it was voted the greatest video game of all time by a Dixons poll in the UK.The game is regarded as one of the most influential video games of all time, for a number of reasons: its titular character was the first original gaming mascot, the game established the maze chase game genre, it demonstrated the potential of characters in video games, it opened gaming to female audiences, and it was gaming's first licensing success. In addition, it was the first video game to feature power-ups, and it is frequently credited as the first game to feature cut scenes, in the form of brief comical interludes about Pac-Man and the monsters chasing each other around during those interludes, though Space Invaders Part II employed a similar technique slightly earlier. Pac-Man is also credited for laying the foundations for the stealth game genre, as it emphasized avoiding enemies rather than fighting them, and had an influence on the early stealth game Metal Gear, where guards chase Solid Snake in a similar manner to Pac-Man when he is spotted.Pac-Man has also influenced many other games, ranging from the open-world sandbox game Grand Theft Auto (where the player runs over pedestrians and gets chased by police in a similar manner) to early first-person shooters such as MIDI Maze (which had similar maze-based gameplay and character designs). Game designer John Romero credited Pac-Man as the game that had the biggest influence on his career; Wolfenstein 3D was similar in level design and featured a Pac-Man level from a first-person perspective, while Doom had a similar emphasis on mazes, power-ups, killing monsters, and reaching the next level.

		<title_clean>Paperboy</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR]The Game[CR]Paperboy Arcade[CR]Paperboy was released to arcades in 1984 by Atari Games. It featured a custom bicycle handle controller that the player would use to accelerate, brake, and turn the titular Paperboy's bicycle on screen. A button would cause him to throw his paper to the left, to either deliver the paper perfectly in a mailbox or doorstep, or for more destructive purposes.[CR]There are three different courses on which you can deliver papers: Easy Street, Middle Road, and Hard Way. You score points for each paper successfully delivered to a subscriber, but also for breaking the windows or other household features of non-subscribers. Each run through the course would be a single day, with an entire game consisting of delivering Monday through Sunday. At the end of each day any subscribers that had a paper successfully delivered would give a bonus. Any subscribers missed on that day would unsubscribe for the following day. If you delivered perfectly to each house you would receive double points for each subscriber, and, unless at the max, get a formerly lost subscriber back.[CR]Each day would get progressively harder, with even Easy Street being quite challenging by Thursday or Friday. The difficulty was ramped up by adding more obstacles, making the doorsteps and mailboxes harder to get at, and increasing the speed of cross traffic on the one intersection. Each run through a particular day is the same, however, so eventually the player can memorize the various patterns.[CR]At the end of the street is the "Training Course", which is an obstacle course with targets, jumps, and static obstacles suitable for running up more points. At then end, a grandstand is filled with your cheering fans.EnemiesDanger Lurks[CR]Static obstacles, such as low brick walls, mailboxes, bushes, garbage cans, push-mowers, fences, and the houses themselves cause you to immediately fall off your bicycle, losing a life. The player is forced to be moving forward at all times, and can only turn so quickly left or right, so it is easy to get in situations where the player just cannot move to the side quickly enough to avoid them.[CR]Mobile obstacles, such as dogs, cars, drunks, men fighting, uni-cyclists, skeletons, RC cars, those evil, evil skateboarding kids, and more are a constant threat, popping up without much warning, crashing into you or forcing you into something else.Incarnations[CR]There have been many console and handheld versions of Paperboy, from the Commodore 64 and TRS-80 all the way to Xbox Live Arcade.[CR]StrategyAmazing Paperboy Delivers![CR]If you're playing to complete a full week, focus on not dying at all until at least Thursday. Get as many points as you can to build up extra lives. Don't be afraid to ride on the lawns, although if you run over any of the flowers of your subscribers, they will promptly unsubscribe.[CR]A good technique for crossing the busy intersection on Easy Street is to go forward, pause for the car rushing by, then go forward quickly.[CR]The individual days don't vary, so memorization of enemy locations is key. It gets tricky, because you're on the same course and can find yourself on Monday avoiding an enemy that doesn't show up until Friday or forgetting to avoid something on Wednesday because you thought they weren't until later in the week. Memorization and twitch reflexes are the name of the game.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Paperboy 2 is the follow up to Atari's minor Arcade hit Paperboy and features identical gameplay. The goal is to deliver papers to all the houses specified by the player's route, while occasionally scoring bonuses by "shooting" excess papers at various targets along the way. The player must also avoid all the obstacles along the street, which range from traffic to dogs to RC cars to the Grim Reaper. The game was developed specifically for early 1990s computers and consoles; unlike the first, it never began life as an Arcade game.[CR]Unlike the original Paperboy, Paperboy 2 also features a girl who delivers papers. The player must also deliver papers to houses on either side of the street, whereas in the first the player simply had the one side to consider. Achieving certain objectives during the run, like foiling a criminal mid-robbery, will put the Paperboy on the front page of the newspaper that appears at the end of the stage.[CR]</plot>

		<title_clean>Pengo</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The player controls Pengo the penguin attempting to navigate an ice world full of enemies called Sno-Bees. Pressing the lone action button while facing an ice block will cause Pengo to push forward the block, which will slide until it hits a wall or another ice block. The ice block will also crush any Sno-Bees in the line of trajectory. Crushing multiple Sno-Bees at once will increase the number of points awarded.[CR]There are a total of sixteen levels, which repeat in order after completing the sixteenth level.[CR]As the player dispatches enemies, new Sno-Bees hatch from eggs located within other ice blocks within the level. Eggs can be eliminated by crushing the ice blocks that contain them. At the beginning of each new level, the ice blocks with eggs within them will momentarily flash a color showing the level of Sno-Bee inside. Pengo can briefly stun Sno-Bees by pushing a side wall, causing the water to ripple. This stun will only effect adjacent Sno-Bees to the player character. When stunned the Sno-Bees can be run over by Pengo. Each level ends when all Sno-Bees have been eliminated.[CR]Diamond blocks located within the level are unbreakable. When diamond blocks are oriented into a vertical or horizontal line the player is awarded 5,000 to 10,000 bonus points depending on whether the line is against a wall or not. The alignment of the diamond blocks will also temporarily stun all Sno-Bees within the level.[CR]When 60 seconds have elapsed in a round without the player dying, the game enters into a sudden death mode; the music speeds up and the movement speed of the Sno-Bees increases.ScoringThe points award for crushing Sno-Bees is dependant on the number crushed in one push of an ice block:[CR]400 points for 1 Sno-Bee[CR]1,600 points for 2 Sno-Bees[CR]3,200 points for 3 Sno-Bees[CR]6,400 points for 4 Sno-Bees[CR]100 points for walking over a stunned Sno-Bee[CR]10,000 points for aligning the three diamond blocks together if at least one is not touching a wall, but only 5,000 if all are against the walls.[CR]30 pointe for crushing an ice block or 500 points if the ice block contains a Sno-Bee egg.A bonus is awarded for time left after completion of a round:[CR]5,000 points for under 20 seconds[CR]2,000 points for between 20&#8211;29 seconds[CR]1,000 points for between 30&#8211;39 seconds[CR]500 points for between 40&#8211;49 seconds[CR]10 points for between 50&#8211;59 seconds[CR]0 points for 60 seconds or more[CR]An extra life is awarded at 30,000 pointsWorld Record High Score[CR]According to Twin Galaxies the world record score for Pengo is held by Rodney Day from Canberra, Australia. His score of 1,110,370 points was set on August 13, 1983.Easter Egg[CR]The credits can be displayed by holding both joysticks up, pressing both action buttons and pressing one start game button at the same time while the game is in "Attract Mode"[CR]</plot>

		<plot>PGA Tour Golf introduced many of the conventions commonly seen in the genre since. The three-click control method (the first to start the swing, the second setting power and over-swing, the third setting draw or fade) allowed for a multitude of different shots, and required a sense of timing. [CR]Four courses are included, one of them a fantasy 'links' course designed by the programmers. Some of the holes are fiendish, with bunkers, water hazards and trees, and the need to plan strategies to get the best approach to the green.[CR]When playing a tournament there are 60 opponents, each representing top US golfers - ten of these appear with tactical advice for each hole.</plot>

		<plot>A follow-up to PGA Tour Golf and a reduced version of it's Genesis counterpart where the player can choose play as a generic pro golfer or as an amateur and compete against four real-life pros including Fred Couples, Paul Azinger, Craig Stadler &amp; Fuzzy Zoeller with six different locations to choose from.  Players can choose to either play in Tournament mode, Skins Play or learn the basics of the game in Practice mode.  [CR]Players use a cursor on a top-down view of a map to determine the location as well as another view from behind the golfer to avoid various obstacles such as trees.  After selecting their location they can then use a meter to the bottom left to determine how much draw or fade will be put into the shot.  To hit the ball, the players presses the "B" button to start the power meter and hitting it again to stop.[CR]Players must also adjust to changing wind and weather conditions during game play which will drastically change the outcome of their shot.  It features four-player capabilities using Gear-to-Gear links as well as a password feature.</plot>

		<title_clean>Phantasy Star Gaiden</title_clean>
		<plot>Long ago, the evil Cablon ravaged the Copto planet, a light year away of the Algol system. When he was defeated, he was sealed on a planet discovered by Alis, the heroine of the first "Phantasy Star", a planet that was also known as Alisland. In this gaiden (side-story) set in Phantasy Star universe, you play the role of two young people from the village Tedo - Alec and Mina. One day, Mina finds an old artifact. While wondering what that could be, the young people learn that Alec' father was attacked and kidnapped by bandits. Determined to find him, the two heroes embark on a dangerous journey that will eventually lead them much further than they suspect. [CR]Phantasy Star Gaiden plays pretty much like any other Phantasy Star starting with the second game: both towns and dungeons are in top-down view, the turn-based battles are viewed from first-person perspective. The gameplay is standard console-style RPG: you should fight random enemies, gain experience and gold, buy better equipment, visit many towns and dungeons, etc.</plot>

		<title_clean>Primal Rage</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Primal Rage is a 2D fighting game developed and released by Atari for arcades in 1994. Players control one of seven giant beasts (who are rendered in stop-motion animation) who must battle each other to conquer a post-apocalyptic neo-Stone Age Earth (known in the game as "Urth"). Although not as popular as the also-violent Mortal Kombat franchise, the game spawned toys, comic books, and a novel, as well as many ports.[CR]A sequel (simply named Primal Rage II) was in development, but was canceled (though some early prototypes have been found).[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Primal Rage plays like a traditional 2D fighting game. Along with a joystick, each player has four buttons arranged in a square (horizontally from Quick to Fierce and vertically from High to Low). Pressing both High Quick and High Fierce simultaneously executes a powerful High Power attack, while pressing both Low Quick and Low Fierce simultaneously executes a powerful Low Power attack.[CR] Unlike traditional fighting games, where special moves are executed by first moving the joystick in a combination and then pressing one or more buttons, Primal Rage includes a system where special moves are executed by holding down certain buttons and then moving the joystick. Fatalities (glorified execution moves that can only be performed at the end of the winner's winning round) are also performed in this way. However, later arcade versions and most ports also include the traditional special move/fatality execution alongside this way.[CR]During the fight, human worshipers from the tribes of both fighters are scattered in the background. All characters have a special move (with unique combinations) which allows them to devour humans that enter the foreground (giving back some of the player's health). Devouring enemy worshipers also grant the player bonus points, while devouring friendly worshipers take away from the player's score.[CR]After defeating all seven opponents In the single-player campaign, the player has dominated Urth. But the beast still needs to prepare for one giant final battle to keep its place as "king of the hill". A bonus round occurs where the player has a limited amount of time to devour friendly worshipers (with no point loss) and flying pterodactyls for bonus health (that is used after the player's health has depleted in the final battle). During the final battle in the hellish "dinosaur graveyard", the player must survive against all seven opponents consecutively in one giant round. If the player loses both the initial health and the bonus health, he can immediately restore his initial health by continuing. The player is granted more points at the end of the campaign by using less continues.[CR]Characters [CR] The character select screen with the seven playable characters.[CR]The game includes seven playable characters. (Six in the Game Boy and Game Gear versions) A final boss character was planned for the final stage, but was scrapped. Sauron and Diablo are palette swaps of each other, while Blizzard and Chaos are also palette swaps. (However, Diablo and Chaos are smaller than Sauron and Blizzard in terms of size) Sauron Talon Vertigo (not available in the Game Boy and Game Gear versions) Blizzard Chaos Armadon Diablo[CR]</plot>

		<title_clean>Prince of Persia</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Prince of Persia 1989[CR]Prince of Persia was originally released in 1989 for the  Apple II by  Jordan Mechner. Mechner used film of his younger brother David running, jumping, and performing many of the Prince's actions. Mechner then  rotoscoped the film to create the animations that give the  Prince his fluid movement.[CR]Part of the game's appeal was its then unique focus on  environmental puzzle-solving, as well as its one-on-one  sword duels. Mechner has stated that the game was inspired by the first ten minutes of Raiders of the Lost Ark, for the character's  acrobatics in a  dangerous environment.[CR]Prince of Persia has since been ported to a number of different platforms, including the  Amiga,  Apple Macintosh, DOS,  NES,  Game Boy,  Sega Genesis,  Game Gear,  SNES,  Sharp X68000,  Atari ST, and SAM Coup&#233;.[CR]The music was written by Jordan Mechner's father,  Francis Mechner.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Prince of Persia is a platformer with heavy emphasis on careful jumping and environmental puzzle solving. The player controls the Prince as he attempts to  rescue his princess before she  weds  Jaffar, the evil Grand Vizier. Jaffar has trapped the  Princess, and given her an hour to decide whether she wishes to marry him or die. This hour unfolds in  real time, and the only way to lose the game is to fail to reach the Princess within sixty minutes.[CR]The player is given only an hour to navigate the game's thirteen levels and rescue her. Scattered throughout each level are hidden  switches, secret  pitfalls and a variety of other hazards standing in the Prince's way of rescuing his beloved. There are also hidden  potions that have a variety of effects on the Prince.[CR]The player will have to explore and pay attention to their environment in order to solve the puzzles and make it to the end. The Prince will also have to fight his way past  guards to reach the Princess. Combat exists as a series of sword fights, which were unusual for its time when  projectile weapons were the norm.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]The Sultan of Persia, one day, leaves to wage war in a foreign land. His Grand Vizier, Jaffar, steps in to take his  throne while he is away. Shortly thereafter, a street urchin decides to climb the Royal Tower to see the Princess, whom people have claimed to be as beautiful as a new moon. When the young  orphan finally sees the Princess,  they fall in love. The couple intend to marry.[CR]The Vizier discovers this and decides that he wants to marry the Princess. He throws the street urchin into the lowest  dungeon and locks the Princess in the highest tower. He then gives the Princess one hour, counted on a magical  hourglass, in which she has to decide to marry the Vizier or die.[CR]The street urchin's main goal is to defeat Jaffar and reach the Princess.[CR][B]Legacy:[/B][CR]The SNES version[CR]Aside from being ported to several different platforms, Prince of Persia has received  two  proper  sequels and a  3D remake.  Ubisoft re-imagined the series with its  Sands of Time  trilogy, and the French publisher again rebooted the series with a new game, titled simply  Prince of Persia. A motion picture based on  Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time is also being developed, Mike Newell directing, and is being produced by  Jerry Bruckheimer. The movie was released in 2010 starring Jake Gyllenhaal, Gemma Arterton, and  Ben Kingsley and was received with average reviews.[CR]The game was  ported many times, and version such as the  SNES one which improved on the original. In the SNES game, the graphics were updated, and the game was given 20 levels, and an extra hour to complete the game.[CR]The original Prince of Persia has sold over 2 million copies.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]When the Game Gear version was released Electronic Gaming Monthly issued the scores of 8,8,7,5 adding, "...very impressed with this version of the game. Not only were all the characters and pitfalls very easy to see on the small screen, but even the very fluid animation found on the other versions of the game was duplicated almost perfectly".[CR]</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]"Wild and Wacky!"[CR]"It's the best of pinball and golfing, the craziest miniature golf game anywhere! Fast action pinball-style bumpers and bars, bank shots, treadmills and water hazards scary enough to frighten a sailor! Get your "sea legs" in the Practice Mode, then accept the challenge of the 1 Player game. Or do battle with a friend and see who can get through the course in the fewest strokes. A real test of patience and eye-hand coordination, and loads of fun!"[CR][B]Game Modes:[/B][CR]The game features three different modes:ScorecardPractice Mode: The practice modes gives players the opportunity to develop a feel for the game. Here the player can learn how to use the power gauge, how to make bank shots and learn strategies for especially difficult courses.1 Player: This mode is more like a regular game of golf. The player has to play through three stages which consist of six holes each. The goal is to finish each hole under par, so that there are still balls remaining at the end of the stage. After each hole the scorecard is displayed.The information shown on the scorecard is:The current stageThe hole numbersThe number of balls remainingThe par rating for each hole in the stageThe number of strokes made on each previous holeThe score on each holeThe total scoreAfter the first two stages there is a bonus stage in which the supply of balls can be replenished. The player has five chances to either hit the bounds three times to make them disappear or to get the ball into the hole.2 Players: The 2 player mode has the players compete on one of the three courses. The winner is whoever finishes the course with the fewer strokes. The little twist to the golf formula is that it is also possible to knock the opponent's ball off the course by either hitting it directly or by activating one of the traps which are found on the course.[CR]Rules and Regulations[CR]The scoring for Putt &amp; Putter is as follows:Albatross: -3 (3 strokes under par)Eagle: -2Birdie: -1Par: /-0 (Score matches par rating)Bogey: 1Double Bogey: 2Triple Bogey: 3 (3 strokes over par)[CR]A play on a hole ends automatically when the strokes exceed Par 5 and Par 10 for a Single Player and a Two Player game respectively.[CR]Hazards and Obstacles[CR]There are several obstacles and hazards in Putt &amp; Putter which are not usually present on a regular golf course.Water: Golf balls don't float! If your ball goes into the water, you lose a shot.Bound: Hitting one of these bumper-like objects sends your ball way off course. Try to avoid them if possible. Hit the same bound three times, though, and it disappears!Stationary Bar: This doesn't give your ball any extra momentum, and can be used to make bank shots.Control Bar: This is a springy bar which you can move. Use it to propel your ball up steep, long inclines.Treadmill: On some holes, you'll find treadmills that move continously. Many of the treadmills can be turned on and off by using the appropriate switch. Watch out, because more often than not, getting caught on a moving treadmill guarantees you a wet ball and a high score for the hole.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Cheat Mode[CR]When the Sega logo appears on the screen, press down-left on the directional pad to go to a secret level select screen.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Cheat Mode[CR]To access the Secret Options screen, press 2 + START when you turn on the game.

		<title_clean>Puyo Puyo</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Puyo Puyo is an arcade puzzle game featuring characters from Compile's Madou Monogatari RPG franchise. It is often referred to as first game of the Puyo Puyo series, despite the fact that an earlier Puyo Puyo title exists. The game was developed by Compile and published by Sega on their Mega Drive-based System C2 hardware. As opposed to its predecessor, the arcade Puyo Puyo places a heavy emphasis on competitive play; the game's single player mode consist of a 13-match gauntlet against various Madou Monogatari enemies, while the multiplayer mode pits two players against each other in a 2-out-of-3 Puyo match.[CR]The arcade version was ported to a variety of platforms. Three of these home ports would be extensively modified for worldwide release: the Genesis and Game Gear ports became Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine, while the SNES port (Super Puyo Puyo) became Kirby's Avalanche.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The player fighting Draco[CR]Puyo Puyo is a puzzle game with two players, although one may be controlled by the computer. Pieces come down in pairs, sometimes of different colors. When players connect at least four pieces, they "pop" those pieces, making them disappear. Two pieces are "connected" when they touch horizontally or vertically but not diagonally. Pieces that were above the popped pieces then fall down to fill the void created. The falling pieces can then create a connection of four similar colored pieces, thus causing a chain.[CR]When the player successfully pops pieces, they send "garbage" pieces are the opposing player, falling from random columns. The more pieces in a pop and the longer the chain, the more pieces are sent. These garbage pieces are uncolored and do not chain but if they are adjacent (again, vertically or horizontally but not diagonally) to a popped colored piece, then they also disappear.[CR]The player that hits the top of the well loses.Game Modes[CR]Puyo Puyo is split into two modes:Single Puyo Puyo[CR]In the game's single player mode, the player assumes the role of Arle Nadja, a sorceress who takes pleasure in ruining Satan's plans. There are three difficulty levels: "Beginner" gives the player three easy opponents unrelated to the main game, "Normal" starts the player at Stage 1 (vs. Draco Centauros), while "Difficult" starts the player at Stage 4 (vs. Harpy). There are 13 stages in the normal game, the last of which is a battle against Satan himself.Double Puyo Puyo[CR]This is basically multiplayer mode. In it two players play against each other. By out-chaining the other player, the player fills out his grid and that leads to victory.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]ProtagonistsArle Nadja: The protagonist. She sets it as her goal to defeat Satan, after he tries to steal her beloved pet Carbuncle, which she loves more than anything. She is a sorceress that can cast Ice, Lightning and Fire.Carbuncle: Arle's beloved pet, the one Satan attempts to steal.Beginner OpponentsSkeleton T: A skeleton that loves drinking herbal tea.Nasu Grave: An eggplant that wears square glasses. He jumps up and down most of the time, as he is too slow to runMummy: An Egyptian mummy who walks around wrapped in bandagesNormal / Difficult OpponentsDraco Centauros: A half-human, half-dragon girl who can manipulate fire.Suketoudara: A fish with muscular human arms and legs.Sukiyapodes: A one-legged, baby-faced monster.Harpy: An angel-like girl that sings out-of-tune, high-pitched songs.Sasoriman: A guard disguised as a scorpion.Panotty: A flute-playing sprite who becomes enraged when Arle doesn't dance to his song.Zombie: A zombie put together by spare parts.Witch: A witch who is prone to random giggles.Zoh Daimaoh: A raging Indian elephant whose Puyo causes the screen to shake.Schezo Wegey: A dark wizard whose desire for Arle's power is comically misconstrued.Minotauros: A minotaur who serves Rulue.Rulue: A female martial artist who is madly in love with Satan. As she was not faced in combat in the original versions of Madou Monogatari, she does not have a voice clip to introduce herself with.Satan: The final boss; a horned demon man who wants to be Arle's fiance.[CR]English Localizations[CR]"Silvana" vs. "Goby Captain" in the English version of unknown origin.[CR]An English-translated version of the arcade release was released in Europe, but the authenticity of this version is disputed; it is not known whether the game was officially localized by Compile/Sega or if it is an unlicensed bootleg. In addition to adding English voice work (and removing the wings from Harpy's sprites), this version changes almost all of the character names. One specific name change, Satan to "Dark Prince," is also used in the English versions of the Neo Geo Pocket Color Puyo Pop and GBA Puyo Pop.[CR]Though the Game Gear port was not released outside of Japan, playing the game in a non-Japanese system will reveal an English version named "Puzlow Kids." Notably, the ending text of Puzlow Kids's scenario mode is identical to the script of the English arcade release; this includes a mention of "the Dark Prince." However, Puyo were renamed to "P-Kids" in this version, while they are known as "PuyoPuyo" in the English arcade game.[CR]Sega and Nintendo published their own localized versions of Puyo Puyo, though they both stripped the Madou Madogatari characters from the game and used their well-known franchises instead. Sega used characters from The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog cartoon to create Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine, while Nintendo and HAL Laboratory used Kirby characters to make Kirby's Avalanche. Mean Bean Machine drops the difficulty level system (and the beginner characters with it), but includes a password feature; the game also reuses several Puyo Puyo BGM tracks, such as Satan's theme becoming the Verses Mode and Danger themes. Kirby's Avalanche does not make any gameplay changes but replaces every song except the Danger theme with Kirby-series BGM.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Puyo Puyo Tsu, also known as Puyo Puyo 2, is the second game in the Puyo Puyo series. The original arcade version was developed by Compile for Sega's Mega Drive-based System C2 hardware, and was published by the latter company in September 1994. Mega Drive and Game Gear ports, also published by Sega, were released in December 1994; other Compile-published ports would be released in the following years.[CR]Puyo Puyo Tsu makes subtle changes to the original Puyo Puyo's ruleset. It introduces "offsetting", which allows players to erase garbage pieces ("Nuisance Puyo") that are waiting for them, and "margin time", which attempts to speed up play by periodically increasing the amount of garbage that is sent per chain.[CR]The Neo Geo Pocket Color port is the first unmodified version of Puyo Puyo to be released outside of Japan. The Virtual Console release of the Mega Drive version is offered worldwide (under the name "Puyo Puyo 2") as an import title; the game remains untranslated and costs slightly more than a localized title on the service.[CR]While not a port or remake of Puyo Puyo Tsu, the GBA Puyo Pop (Minna de Puyo Puyo) uses this game's ruleset.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Like other games in the Puyo Puyo franchise, Puyo Puyo 2 is a competitive tile-matching puzzle game where falling pieces must be placed alongside one another to form color combinations. If four or more pieces of the same color are placed next to each other, the chain of pieces disappears, freeing up space on one player's screen while introducing extra garbage pieces to the other player's screen.[CR]As in the original Puyo Puyo, both single and multiplayer modes are included, with the single player mode featuring the return of protagonist Arle Nadja. New in this release is a tiered progression system, where players must amass a certain number of points within each tier of levels before moving on. Also new is the introduction of "offsetting", which allows a player to remove garbage pieces sent to them (and even send them back to their opponent) by quickly performing a combo before the garbage falls.[CR]Single Player Opponents[CR]As mentioned before, the single player mode consists of several "tiers." The player chooses an opponent via roulette to battle and continues until either enough points have been amassed to "Level Up" or they have fought all of the opponents; if the latter happens, the player fights an extra opponent. If the player still hasn't gained enough points, they will receive a Game Over.[CR]The "extra" opponent is noted in parenthesis:Level 1: Skeleton T, Will-o-Wisp, Sukiyapodes, Trio the Banshee, Nomi, Momomo, Baromett, Mini Zombie (Extra: Masked Satan)Level 2: Panotty, Uroko Sakana Bito, Nohoho, Cait Sith, Fufufu, Mummy (Extra: Owl Bear)Level 3: Sasoriman, Samurai Mole, Harpy, Parara, Nasu Grave (Extra: Zombie)Level 4: Suketoudara, Mamono, Witch, Pakista (Extra: Dragon)Level 5: Minotauros, Draco Centauros (Extra: Zoh Daimaoh)Level 6 (faced sequentially): Schezo Wegey, Rulue, either Satan (Dark Prince) or Masked Satan (Masked Prince) depending on certain conditions[CR]Puyo Pop[CR]As previously mentioned, the Neo Geo Pocket/Color port of Puyo Puyo Tsu was released outside of Japan as Puyo Pop. The game is graphically similar to the Game Boy version; both versions of the game use stripes and various shapes as a means of differentiating Puyo in their respective monochrome modes. Due to the limitations of the Neo Geo Pocket's sound hardware, the player must choose between in-battle BGM or Arle's voice samples.[CR]Puyo Pop contains many of the features present in other home versions of Puyo Puyo Tsu. The 1P vs. COM mode now features three difficulty levels: Easy contains three sets of easier opponents, Normal is the single player mode of the arcade game, and Hard is a gauntlet against all 33 opponents. The Self Dev. mode contains 1P (Endless Mode) and Exam, which assigns the player a rank after he or she clears three rows of Nuisance Puyo.[CR]Unlike previous Western-released Puyo Puyo titles, the game retains most of the Japanese version's Madou Monogatari-based characters and names. The sole exception is Satan; his name is changed to "Dark Prince", the same name that he used in the unreleased "Puzlow Kids" translation of the first game.[CR]</plot>

		<title_clean>Puzzle and Action Tanto-R</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Puzzle &amp; Action: Tant-R is a mini-game collection of puzzles and the first of three spin-offs of Sega's Bonanza Bros., a co-op crime caper stealth action game based somewhat on The Blues Brothers. Like Bonanza Bros., the game is designed for two players to compete with one another, though it can be played single-player as well.[CR]The goal of Tant-R is to chase after escaped convicts by solving mini-games. These mini-games are selected at random, though the player can stop on the desired mini-game with a roulette function similarly to how mini-games are decided in the Mario Party series. Some of these roulette options instead provide bonuses (such as additional lives) and lead to a random game. Most of these mini-games involve solving common puzzles such as sliding blocks around to form a picture or solving shell games involving ninjas and top hats.[CR]The game was released in the Arcades initially in 1992, and then ported to the Mega Drive and Game Gear in Japan only. It was followed with two sequels: 1994's Puzzle &amp; Action: Ichidant-R, also for the Arcade, Mega Drive and Game Gear; and 1997's Puzzle &amp; Action: Treasure Hunt, for the Arcade and Saturn.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The player must complete several mini-games, chosen from a roulette of four at a time, in order to re-capture the game's antagonist. At the end, they must then solve one unique boss mini-game to complete the capture. The single-player mode is split up into four chapters: each chapter adds an extra four games to the required total to win, as well as making all the mini-games harder, either by speeding them up, making them more complex or reducing the timer (or a combination thereof).[CR]The featured mini-games include:Robot Factory: The player must assemble the robot shown in the picture, choosing from an array of body parts. The finished robot requires a head, a body, two arms and two legs.Photoshock: The goal of this game is to take a picture just as a fast-moving subject enters the frame in the middle of the screen. A simple timing mini-game that requires the player be precise.Which Digit Is It?: The player is shown a four digit code but only one number at a time, which is rapidly changing. The player must select the right four digit code from a list based on what they can see.Pathmaker Flip-Flop Frog: The player must guide a frog around a pond, stopping on every available square without repeating or doubling-back. The player can reverse a mistake, but has a strict time limit.Pay Hattention to the Flower: A variant of the classic shell game. The player must keep track of a rose under one of four top hats as they quickly switch positions.Zig-Zag Labyrinth: The player must find the right course through a maze. The angled top-down view makes the maze visually confusing.Certain Death! Unstopwatchable: The player must simply pause a stopwatch between the times indicated. They usually have less than a decisecond margin of error.A Change of Art: The player must unscramble a picture. Each picture is much longer than tall, and some images are harder to assemble than others (such as a pile of identical coins).Stanley How-Many-Cubericks?: The player is shown an isometric pile of blocks and must determine how many are in the picture. They must count those concealed by blocks lying on top. The title refers to legendary film director Stanley Kubrick.Cock-A-Doodle Do Your Worst: A button-mashing game that requires the player pump up balloons until they burst, scaring a nearby rooster.Make It a Slot Boogie: The player must find a series of five symbols in a large grid. This series can be horizontal or vertical, but must be in a row. The symbols are all icons usually found on slot machines (bar, cherry, seven, etc.).Billy Jewel: The player must shift gems around a four-by-four grid to ensure all the gems of a certain color are in the right position. The title refers to singer Billy Joel.Block n' Roll: Using the equation provided, the player must determine the correct shape from a grid of options.Where's the Ninja?: A pair of ninjas rapidly flash around the screen before vanishing. The player must select the location where the golden ninja was last seen.Animal Sound Shower: A variant on the classic puzzle game Simon. The player must recreate a series of animal noises by tapping on the correct animal heads, using only their memory.Three-Hint Panel Pick: The player is given a grid of shapes and colors and is given three hints as to the right panel. These include directional hints ("under a circle") as well as information on the shape/color of the desired panel.Boss Showdown!: The final mini-game, played exactly once at the end of the single-player mode. The boss has hidden himself somewhere, and the player is given a set of coordinates. They must quickly find the location on a large map filled with possibilities.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Sound Test[CR]At the main menu, hold 1+2 and press Start for a Sound Test.</plot>

		<plot>Ren and Stimpy just found a pair of hooves which belong to the great Shaven Yak, who lost them in the last Yak shaving day. Now they must find the Shaven Yak and return him his hooves, or there won't be any more Yak shaving days![CR]In this platform game the player is prompted to choose playing either as Ren or Stimpy at the start of new life or some stages. Both can jump and shoot (Ren shoots toothbrushes, Stimpy spits), but each one has his own special ability: Ren can perform high jumps, Stimpy can smash things jumping over them. Each character starts the game with three lives.[CR]Throughout levels such as "The Blacker Than Black Forest", "The Stinking Dry Desert" or "The Stinking Wet Bayou", Ren and Stimpy will face most animal enemies, such as birds, frogs, vultures, woodpeckers, snakes, etc. The levels are divided in few or several sub-level, and at the end of each level, they'll face a boss.[CR]They'll also find some unusual weapons, as a slice of bread (which flies in circles), a remote controller (which casts electric waves) and a soap bar (which casts bubbles). If they get hit when using a weapon, they'll lose it, but won't lose health. They'll gain health by picking items like TVs, cash bags, bottles and boots.[CR]https://www.mobygames.com/game/game-gear/quest-for-the-shaven-yak-starring-ren-hok-stimpy[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Debugging Password and more...[CR]Choose Continue from the Main Menu to enter one of the following passwords.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Debugging Password and more...[CR]Please enter the following at the password screen.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Debugging Password and more...[CR]Go to Continue and type:</plot>

		<plot>This handheld version is different from it's console cousin in terms of content.  While the game still features 28 teams modeled after their real-life 1993 MLB counterparts (with the exception of the MLB license) there are fewer players in this version.  Each team also has previous hall of fame teams that range back into the 1980's.[CR]There is only one mode of play available, a single-player exhibition where the player picks a team to face off against a computer A.I. team.  However, if the player picks two teams from the same league, the game will have the player compete in a best-of-seven series, complete with passwords.  There is also a Watch option that lets the player watch two computer A.I. teams compete against each other.</plot>

That's why he has to explore deep dark forests, cross endless oceans, climb treacherous slopes, survive endless volcanoes, and even walk through clouds. But Tom-Tom will never be totally alone. You see, when he goes through the exotic locations, he has to come face to face with its inhabitants, like bees, spiders, snakes, coal-kids, frogs, bats, snails, coyotes, and octopuses, to name a few. The hatchet is Tom-Tom's only line of defense against these menaces.[CR]There are ten areas, each containing four rounds each, but the tenth area can't be accessed unless Tom-Tom collects all the dolls during his rescue mission. During his journey, he can break open different eggs that will reveal hatchets, skateboards, mushrooms, milk, and even guardian angels. You can ride the skateboard through each round, as long as you don't collide with an inhabitant. When you complete each round while still riding the skateboard, you'll start the next round still riding it. As you progress through each round, your vitality will start to get low, but it can be increased by getting milk, mushrooms, potato chips,or fruit that appear everywhere you go. As well as the normal eggs, there are also speckled eggs that must be avoided, otherwise the God of Death will be released, and once he follows you, you'll lose vitality much quickly. At the end of every fourth round, there is a king waiting to destroy you with his fireballs or lightning bolts.[CR]There are also warp-gates, but you don't find them, they find you. You see, warp-gates appear in rounds 1-4 of each area. If you happen to get one fruit, a special item will appear. These special items include handbags, wrist watches, a pair of shoes, a teddy bear, and a bottle of perfume. Another girl will appear and take you up to the clouds where the object is to collect as many hearts as you can without falling down or getting the item again. Once you have collected all the hearts, you can get the item to return to the surface, and more often than not, you'll get further in the round.[CR]https://www.mobygames.com/game/game-gear/wonder-boy[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Unlock all weapons, full money[CR]Select continue and enter this password.

		<title_clean>Rise of the Robots</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]At the time of the game's release, people were very impressed by the advanced 3D visuals.Rise of the Robots is a fighting game developed by Mirage Technologies and released on a wide variety of platforms including the SNES and Sega Master System. The game was even released in an arcade cabinet.All of the featured characters are robots, with the exception of the main player character featured on the front cover, who is in fact a cyborg; whenever he is defeated in battle, a brief cutscene is shown of his lifeless body, and as the armour around his face is destroyed, we see a human eye underneath. This style was influenced by several popular movies at the time like Blade Runner and The Terminator.The game had a lot of hype pre-release due to the highly detailed visuals and soundtrack by rock guitarist Brian May (of Queen fame). It was intended to take the gameplay of similar fighting games like Street Fighter II, and mesh it with highly advanced visuals to create a new, more technologically advanced era of fighting games. However, upon release the game failed to live up to expectations; the graphics, visuals, and soundtrack were all well made, but the controls handled terribly and movement felt sluggish. The game was almost universally panned by critics and quickly became known for it's poor controls, repetitive gameplay, and lack of any real substance. Some critics went so far as to claim that the reason the gameplay was so bad, was because so much development time had been spent on making the visuals as advanced as possible, and that the reason the movement and fighting felt so sluggish was because the graphics had to use so much memory and so many frames to even convey something as simple as a straight punch. Aside from the usual commands of punches and kicks, there were only a maximum of two special moves per character, and no real combos to speak of, leading to most battles involving players resorting to using constant flying kicks against their opponent in order to take them down, a strategy seen in much older games like Yie Ar Kung Fu. In addition one of the chief complaints was that players only had one character to chose from in single player mode (Cotton) and that even in multiplayer mode one player always had to play as Cotton.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The game is set in the year 2043, in the land of Metropolis 4. An extremely large company called Electrocorp has a large amount of control over the world thanks to their technological breakthroughs in the fields of science and medicine, they have amassed a fortune greater than that of any other company or country, and have power over all the energy distribution across the planet. In this world, robots are humans servants and perform virtually every task imaginable, leaving humans to focus on developing more important technology and try to make new scientific breakthroughs. Electrocorp, as the world's leading producer and distributor of robots, has been put under great pressure due to the high demand of the increasing global population and so decide to create a supremely advanced AI which will be able to manage the company effectively and cope with the demand of the people. Thus, the Leader Project is established at the Metropolis 4 sector of the Electrocorp company. The project culminates with the creation of The Supervisor, an incredibly intelligent robot, more advanced than anything Electrocorp has ever built before, with the capacity to learn at an incredibly fast rate, along with being able to absorb knowledge from computer terminals in a matter of seconds, The Supervisor quickly exceeds all expectations of the scientists at Metropolis 4, and seems to have become the perfect robot, easily able to cope with the high levels of demand faced by the company, along with developing new ways to increase productivity and efficiency within Electrocorp. The Supervisor is granted power to control every single robot on the planet whenever it needs to.However, things do not continue to go according to plan, while running general diagnostic checks on The Supervisor at Metropolis 4, the scientists discover some new mysterious lines of data in their results and quickly learn that The Supervisor has been infected with the most advanced computer virus ever seen, the EGO virus. Normally this virus would simply destroy a computer or robot, but the effects seen on The Supervisor are completely unexpected. The Supervisor becomes self-aware, it begins to question why it has been made and why it should continue to do as it has been programmed, The Supervisor then takes on a humanoid female form as it decides to create a gender-specific identity for itself. As the virus continues to disrupt the programming put in place by Electrocorp, The Supervisor decides to disobey all orders from the company and take control of every robot on the planet, transmitting the virus to them electronically and ordering them all to rebel against their human masters, initiating a global cybernetic mutiny. The robots begin to destroy everything around them and chaos spreads across the globe, meanwhile, some scientists and officials trapped inside the plant at Metropolis 4 try to come up with a plan to destroy The Supervisor, there is no way for any of them to access her as she is guarded by an army of destructive robots, and so they decide to contact the cyborg ECO35-2, known affectionately as Coton, a half-robot, half-human creation who has not been affected by the EGO virus thanks to his organic brain, the scientists inform Coton that he is the world's only hope for survival and he must battle his way through Metropolis 4 to The Supervisor and eliminate her. Thus the battle begins, with Coton having to take on all of The Supervisor's powerful robot minions, before eventually reaching her and defeating her humanoid form in combat, thus restoring order to the planet and saving all of it's surviving inhabitants.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]ECO35-2 (Coton) - The protagonist of the story and only playable character in the single-player campaign, Coton is a cyborg with a human mind and organs, developed in secret by Electrocorp with a budget equivalent to that of the Leader Project. Despite his enemies often carrying and utilising weapons of some kind, Coton fights using only his fists, he has a thick armour plating covering his humanoid body from head to toe, and has been genetically engineered to be as fast and simultaneously powerful as possible. As stated, he has a human central nervous system and brain, no electrical components have been inserted into his body and so the EGO virus had no effect on him, allowing him to retain autonomy and take orders from the Electrocorp scientists to go after The Supervisor. All of his human organs were cloned from the CEO of Electrocorp, who in turn raised Coton as his own son, thus, when the CEO was slaughtered by rebellious robots in the beginning's of the robot mutiny of Metropolis 4, Coton wanted revenge for the murder of what he believed to be his father, thus giving him extra incentive and motive to pursue The Supervisor and destroy her.His special attacks are as follows:Turbo Head Butt - A devastating flying head butt where Coton flies across the screen towards his enemy, doing a great amount of damage if he is able to connect with the attack.Shoulder Charge - A short range barge attack, useful for getting out of corners.Loader - This is the first of six enemies Coton encounters in his quest to destroy The Supervisor. The loader, as its name suggests, was originally simply a loading droid working in the warehouses of Metropolis 4, its primary duty being to lift and carry heavy objects and load them onto trucks to be dispatched elsewhere. When it became infected with the EGO virus however, this loader became a destructive and lethal force, despite being slow-moving and ill-suited for combat, the loader has powerful attacks thanks to its heavy forked arms. As this is the first enemy in the game, it is slow moving and has poor AI, and can easily be defeated with Coton's superior speed and jumping abilities.The special attack of the Loader:Fork Slash - A mighty horizontal blow in which the Loader swings its fork arms at its opponent, slicing anything that gets in the way.Builder - The second enemy encountered in the game, the builder has the appearance of a large blue robotic gorilla, and acts in a similar fashion, using its superior upper body strength to move along on its knuckles whilst defending its relatively small and weak legs. This enemy is also slow-moving and focuses mainly on defense, forcing Coton to gradually wear it down with a rapid succession of attacks.The special attacks of the Builder:Pile Driver - This is a grab move wherein the Builder picks up Coton, spinning him upside down before slamming him down into the ground.Bomber Jump - With this move, the Builder demonstrates its surprising acrobatic abilities by leaping high into the air and slamming down to the ground, releasing a destructive shockwave upon impact.Crusher - The first relatively fast enemy encountered in the game, the Crusher has an insect like appearance, light thin legs allow for much more rapid movement than either the Loader or the Builder, and its sharp snapping pincers have the potential to do a great deal of damage should anything be caught within their grasp.The special attack of the Crusher:Pincer-Mincer - In this attack the Crusher extends its long arms, if it manages to connect with its opponent, the pincers will slowly crush the life out of them.Military - The first enemy encountered by Coton that has true fighting experience and was genuinely designed for combat, the Military droid appears humanoid in shape, can move almost as fast as Coton, and has powerful punches and kicks. This enemy has a high level of defense and is programmed to be able to quickly adapt to any combat situation, meaning that the AI for this enemy is more advanced than those that preceded it.Special attacks of the Military droid:Catapult Spin - For this attack the Military droid extends its arms and spins towards its opponent, should Coton come into contact with the spinning arms he will incur a great amount of damage.Cyber Slash - Here the Military droid reveals a hidden weapon, an extendable sword protrudes from its arm which it then uses to slash at anything in its path.Sentry - Another droid built for combat. The Sentry is a red, demonic looking robot, much stronger than the Military droid, and standing at 3.5 metres tall, the Sentry poses an intimidating challenge for Coton. The jets on its back allow it to fly for brief periods of time, and there are several in-built weapons upon the Sentry, none of which are actually utilised in game.Special attack of the Sentry:Flying Jet Kick - Here the Sentry makes use of its jetpacks to fly towards its opponent at rapid speed, delivering a destructive kick.The Supervisor - The final enemy in the game and by far the most advanced. The Supervisor appears in a humanoid female form, possessing both incredible speed and power to rival that of Coton, along with the most advanced artificial intelligence known to man, The Supervisor is certainly Coton's most difficult opponent.[CR]Sequel[CR]A sequel to the game, entitled Resurrection: Rise 2, was released for the PlayStation, Sega Saturn, and PC in 1996. It featured several of the characters from the first game, continuing the story of Coton, and once again included music written and performed by Brian May.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>Road Rash is an aggressive motorcycle racing game where the player assumes the role of a biker who takes part in a series of illegal races across the U.S.A. Starting at the back of the pack the objective is always to finish first on a linear course, overtaking the other bikers. This is achieved by driving very well or by playing it dirty, knocking opponents of their bikes using clubs, crowbars or your bare hands. The other racers fight back in a similar fashion and there are also hazards. All the races take place on the regular road with normal traffic (in both directions) and the cops, as well as occasional oil slicks and stray cows.[CR]By winning races you can get promoted to a stronger division and earn cash with which you can buy a better bike. Whenever you're knocked off your bike or hit something you will have to run back to your bike and lose valuable time, plus your bike will suffer some damage. When the player crashes with cops nearby, it is possible to get busted and then you have to forfeit the race.[CR]Like the whole Road Rash lineage, the game has arcade-like gameplay with no intention to be a motorcycle simulation. While the game has a two-player mode, this is not simultaneous.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level 2 Password[CR]At the options screen, select 'Password Entry' then enter[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level 2 Password[CR]Enter one of these passwords to start the game on level 5 with the corresponding motorcycle.</plot>

		<plot>Your name is Kevin Codner  rescue mariner extraordinaire, answering the distress call of a sinking cruise liner, the SS Lucifer. You set off in your little submarine and board the ship where a horde of passengers desperately need your keen oversight and "shipsmarts".[CR]In 60 levels you have to rescue as many passengers (dubbed the Dim Passengers) as possible. At the beginning the passengers fall through a tube in the level. Similar to Lemmings you have to find a way for the passengers to the exit of the level. In order to do so, you must blast hindrances such cargo boxes and bulkheads with bombs or, when no bombs are left, reposition the boxes with a crane. There are also conveyor belts in the levels. If the belt moves in the wrong way, the passengers either can't use it or may even be transported to their dooms, being dropped off into water, fire or steam jets. You can usually choose the direction of the belts by pulling a lever.[CR]There are several types of scenarios that Kevin Codner (you) are faced with throughout the game. Of course the puzzles get progressively more difficult, involving things like patching up cracked pipes to stop a lethal jet of steam from cooking the distressed passengers. You can blast away obstacles and stack crates in creative manners. For instance, you can have them fall onto each other to form a bridge across a gap or to provide shielding from fire. This is usually done by hoisting them onto conveyor belts using a crane.[CR]Each level has a certain "save limit", meaning you have to save at least a certain amount of passengers. This again is akin a bit towards Lemmings, and lots of levels have a built-in time limit, represented be water pouring into the compartment, rising ominously. When the water rises high enough, the passengers will get carried along with it, and they can only swim for a short period of time before getting exhausted and drowning, so you'd better be on time with some assistance.[CR]At the end of each level you receive a password (again, Lemmings-style) so that you may pick up your game from the current level without having to progress through them all from the get-go.[CR]https://www.mobygames.com/game/game-gear/sink-or-swim[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Stage Passwords[CR]From the Main Menu, choose Password and enter one of the following:</plot>

		<title_clean>Samurai Shodown</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Samurai Shodown (known in Japan as Samurai Spirits) is a 2D fighting game developed and released by SNK for arcades (using the Neo Geo MVS hardware) and the Neo Geo AES on August 11, 1993.Set in the late 18th century, Samurai Shodown is known for being the first fighting game to focus on weapon-based combat and for its style of that era's Japanese culture (including calligraphy and musical instruments). The game is also known for its quirky translation, traditional control scheme, camera zoom effects (in similar vein to Art of Fighting), randomly-dropped items (including food for healing and bombs for damage), and the Rage Meter (in which receiving damage causes the fighter to temporarily become "enraged" and more powerful).Along with being one of the few Neo Geo games to receive ports to most fourth-generation game consoles, the game spawned numerous sequels and spin-off titles throughout the Neo Geo's life cycle (making it one of SNK's most well-known game series).[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]A typical fight, taken from the SNES version.Players face each other one-on-one, in a 2D field that can be enlarged if the fighters are far enough from each other. Unlike other fighters, however, each character fights with a weapon, ranging from swords (in fact, most characters use swords) to spears. They can also use physical attacks (there are strong/weak attack buttons for both weapons and physical attacks), but this rarely comes up. The weapons increase the range of characters' regular attacks, and if both characters attack in a precise way, they can lock weapons. When they lock weapons, each player must rapidly press buttons to win the standstill; the loser drops their weapon, while a tie results in both players losing their weapons.Also unlike other fighters, the game featured items. They included treasure (points), food (healing), and bombs (damage). A running referee would toss them into the arena at random intervals. In addition, a referee would hold up a flag whenever one of the players took a hit; he would hold up a different colored flag depending on who got hit. This referee, named Kuroko, would become a hidden character in the Game Boy port, using his flags as weapons.Samurai Shodown also featured mini-games at regular intervals throughout the single-player mode. Players had to slash through ten straw men in the span of thirty seconds. Straw men would only stay up for a short amount of time, this amount of time lessening in later iterations of the mini-game. For the most part, cutscenes took place immediately before and after the mini-game, showing Amakusa's rise to power and his revenge against the Tokugawa. There were only two exceptions, one of them being the ending for a particular character's story.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Note: this only covers characters present in the original arcade version.AmakusaThe main villain of the first Samurai Shodown game and several games afterward, Amakusa wishes to destroy the Tokugawa and gain great magical power. Unfortunately, he is not a playable character. Amakusa has one of the widest movesets in the game, being able to launch himself like a meteor, create a boomerang-esque ball of magic energy, teleport around the stage several times, and punch at his opponents rapidly.Gen-AnA green devil, Gen-An can rush at his opponents as a spinning blade-ball, climbing the wall he hits to come back down and hit them again. Gen-An can also send a ball of poison gas at his opponents, potentially disabling them temporarily if it hits. He fights his enemies with a giant steel claw he wears on his right hand.GalfordGalford and Poppy.A San Francisco swordsman, Galford is one of two characters in the game to get assistance from an animal: his dog, Poppy. Poppy is most likely a girl, since the credits reveal that she has puppies. Like Hanzo, Galford can launch projectiles at his opponents, create holograms of himself to confuse his enemies, and disappear to strike from above. He can also send Poppy to maul other fighters.JubeiLike Hanzo, Jubei is based on a famous historical figure; in this case, he is a legendary samurai. His moveset includes multiple stabs, followed by an uppercut similar to Charlotte's, and sending a shockwave along the ground to his enemies. Jubei insists that he is not that guy from Fatal Fury.UkyoA blue-haired swordsman from Japan. Ukyo can send a fire bird down while jumping, and repeatedly slash at his opponent. He signals the latter by throwing an apple, which he rapidly slashes, as well.CharlotteA French knight, Charlotte is one of two female characters in Samurai Shodown. She is sensitive about this fact, telling opponents not to mention her plate (most likely her breast plate). After defeating Amakusa, Charlotte returns to France to aid the peasants in the French Revolution. She can perform a triangle slash, drag a green column up with her while jumping, and charge at her opponents with multiple sword thrusts.Tam-TamTam-TamA Mayan warrior always seen wearing a mask. Oddly enough, he is one of the few characters with any stake in what Amakusa is doing; after beating him, he takes the orb that Amakusa used as a weapon. This orb apparently belongs to the Mayans, and Tam-Tam uses it to heal the ailments of those around him. Tam-Tam can throw skulls, summon rising demons, and spin his flaming sword while moving toward his opponent.EarthquakeBased in Texas, Earthquake is the leader of a gang of thieves searching for treasure. In fact, upon defeating Amakusa, his three subordinates return to him with piles of treasure. He is tall, fat, and missing several teeth. Earthquake can rush toward his opponent as a spinning blade ball, or bounce toward them to harm them with his butt.NakoruruAn Ainu priestess, Nakoruru is not only one of the two female characters in the first Samurai Shodown, but also one of two characters who fight with animal friends. Her hawk, Mamahaha, can lift Nakoruru into the air, allowing her to drop down and slash her opponent. She can also rush toward her opponent, either remaining on the ground or rising up to do so.Wan-FuThe King of China, Wan-Fu is the only character who can voluntarily give up their weapon. This is done by jumping into the air and tossing a flaming sword at the opponent. Usually, when the AI does this, they run toward the sword to retrieve it. Wan-Fu can also perform an uppercut with his sword.HaohmaruHaohmaru's ending.The protagonist of the Samurai Shodown series, Haohmaru is a Japanese swordsman. His moves include sending a tornado at enemies and a type of sword uppercut. After his fight with Amakusa, Haohmaru returns to Japan and fights Mai Shiranui of King of Fighters fame.HanzoA Tokugawa ninja based on a historical figure. He can send fire toward his opponents, throw shurikens, and disappear to strike from above. After defeating Amakusa, Hanzo spends his life training other ninjas.KyoshiroA kabuki actor, Kyoshiro can toss flaming fans, spin-jump at his opponents, and use his poll to thrust himself at the opponent as a fireball.[CR]Ports[CR]The SNES port of Samurai Shodown removed a lot from the arcade original, like the blood and large battlefields.After being made for the Neo Geo, Samurai Shodown was ported to many systems. However, few were capable of running the game at the technical level that the Neo Geo did. For example, the SNES, Genesis, and Sega CD versions removed the scaling present in the original; instead, they kept the characters at a constant size (the Genesis and Sega CD used the large sprites, the SNES their small counterparts). The SNES and Genesis versions also removed the blood present in the original. The port closest to the original was the 3DO version, which kept the scaling and blood that the others lacked.In addition to a playable Amakusa, the Game Boy version had two additional unlockable characters: Kuroko, the referee, and Hikyaku, the courier man that throws item onto the battlefield.

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Samurai Shodown (known in Japan as Samurai Spirits) is a 2D fighting game developed and released by SNK for arcades (using the Neo Geo MVS hardware) and the Neo Geo AES on August 11, 1993.Set in the late 18th century, Samurai Shodown is known for being the first fighting game to focus on weapon-based combat and for its style of that era's Japanese culture (including calligraphy and musical instruments). The game is also known for its quirky translation, traditional control scheme, camera zoom effects (in similar vein to Art of Fighting), randomly-dropped items (including food for healing and bombs for damage), and the Rage Meter (in which receiving damage causes the fighter to temporarily become "enraged" and more powerful).Along with being one of the few Neo Geo games to receive ports to most fourth-generation game consoles, the game spawned numerous sequels and spin-off titles throughout the Neo Geo's life cycle (making it one of SNK's most well-known game series).[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]A typical fight, taken from the SNES version.Players face each other one-on-one, in a 2D field that can be enlarged if the fighters are far enough from each other. Unlike other fighters, however, each character fights with a weapon, ranging from swords (in fact, most characters use swords) to spears. They can also use physical attacks (there are strong/weak attack buttons for both weapons and physical attacks), but this rarely comes up. The weapons increase the range of characters' regular attacks, and if both characters attack in a precise way, they can lock weapons. When they lock weapons, each player must rapidly press buttons to win the standstill; the loser drops their weapon, while a tie results in both players losing their weapons.Also unlike other fighters, the game featured items. They included treasure (points), food (healing), and bombs (damage). A running referee would toss them into the arena at random intervals. In addition, a referee would hold up a flag whenever one of the players took a hit; he would hold up a different colored flag depending on who got hit. This referee, named Kuroko, would become a hidden character in the Game Boy port, using his flags as weapons.Samurai Shodown also featured mini-games at regular intervals throughout the single-player mode. Players had to slash through ten straw men in the span of thirty seconds. Straw men would only stay up for a short amount of time, this amount of time lessening in later iterations of the mini-game. For the most part, cutscenes took place immediately before and after the mini-game, showing Amakusa's rise to power and his revenge against the Tokugawa. There were only two exceptions, one of them being the ending for a particular character's story.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Note: this only covers characters present in the original arcade version.AmakusaThe main villain of the first Samurai Shodown game and several games afterward, Amakusa wishes to destroy the Tokugawa and gain great magical power. Unfortunately, he is not a playable character. Amakusa has one of the widest movesets in the game, being able to launch himself like a meteor, create a boomerang-esque ball of magic energy, teleport around the stage several times, and punch at his opponents rapidly.Gen-AnA green devil, Gen-An can rush at his opponents as a spinning blade-ball, climbing the wall he hits to come back down and hit them again. Gen-An can also send a ball of poison gas at his opponents, potentially disabling them temporarily if it hits. He fights his enemies with a giant steel claw he wears on his right hand.GalfordGalford and Poppy.A San Francisco swordsman, Galford is one of two characters in the game to get assistance from an animal: his dog, Poppy. Poppy is most likely a girl, since the credits reveal that she has puppies. Like Hanzo, Galford can launch projectiles at his opponents, create holograms of himself to confuse his enemies, and disappear to strike from above. He can also send Poppy to maul other fighters.JubeiLike Hanzo, Jubei is based on a famous historical figure; in this case, he is a legendary samurai. His moveset includes multiple stabs, followed by an uppercut similar to Charlotte's, and sending a shockwave along the ground to his enemies. Jubei insists that he is not that guy from Fatal Fury.UkyoA blue-haired swordsman from Japan. Ukyo can send a fire bird down while jumping, and repeatedly slash at his opponent. He signals the latter by throwing an apple, which he rapidly slashes, as well.CharlotteA French knight, Charlotte is one of two female characters in Samurai Shodown. She is sensitive about this fact, telling opponents not to mention her plate (most likely her breast plate). After defeating Amakusa, Charlotte returns to France to aid the peasants in the French Revolution. She can perform a triangle slash, drag a green column up with her while jumping, and charge at her opponents with multiple sword thrusts.Tam-TamTam-TamA Mayan warrior always seen wearing a mask. Oddly enough, he is one of the few characters with any stake in what Amakusa is doing; after beating him, he takes the orb that Amakusa used as a weapon. This orb apparently belongs to the Mayans, and Tam-Tam uses it to heal the ailments of those around him. Tam-Tam can throw skulls, summon rising demons, and spin his flaming sword while moving toward his opponent.EarthquakeBased in Texas, Earthquake is the leader of a gang of thieves searching for treasure. In fact, upon defeating Amakusa, his three subordinates return to him with piles of treasure. He is tall, fat, and missing several teeth. Earthquake can rush toward his opponent as a spinning blade ball, or bounce toward them to harm them with his butt.NakoruruAn Ainu priestess, Nakoruru is not only one of the two female characters in the first Samurai Shodown, but also one of two characters who fight with animal friends. Her hawk, Mamahaha, can lift Nakoruru into the air, allowing her to drop down and slash her opponent. She can also rush toward her opponent, either remaining on the ground or rising up to do so.Wan-FuThe King of China, Wan-Fu is the only character who can voluntarily give up their weapon. This is done by jumping into the air and tossing a flaming sword at the opponent. Usually, when the AI does this, they run toward the sword to retrieve it. Wan-Fu can also perform an uppercut with his sword.HaohmaruHaohmaru's ending.The protagonist of the Samurai Shodown series, Haohmaru is a Japanese swordsman. His moves include sending a tornado at enemies and a type of sword uppercut. After his fight with Amakusa, Haohmaru returns to Japan and fights Mai Shiranui of King of Fighters fame.HanzoA Tokugawa ninja based on a historical figure. He can send fire toward his opponents, throw shurikens, and disappear to strike from above. After defeating Amakusa, Hanzo spends his life training other ninjas.KyoshiroA kabuki actor, Kyoshiro can toss flaming fans, spin-jump at his opponents, and use his poll to thrust himself at the opponent as a fireball.[CR]Ports[CR]The SNES port of Samurai Shodown removed a lot from the arcade original, like the blood and large battlefields.After being made for the Neo Geo, Samurai Shodown was ported to many systems. However, few were capable of running the game at the technical level that the Neo Geo did. For example, the SNES, Genesis, and Sega CD versions removed the scaling present in the original; instead, they kept the characters at a constant size (the Genesis and Sega CD used the large sprites, the SNES their small counterparts). The SNES and Genesis versions also removed the blood present in the original. The port closest to the original was the 3DO version, which kept the scaling and blood that the others lacked.In addition to a playable Amakusa, the Game Boy version had two additional unlockable characters: Kuroko, the referee, and Hikyaku, the courier man that throws item onto the battlefield. Although Kuroko would also become a playable character in later games, Hikyaku has yet to resurface in that role.Samurai Shodown would also appear in later compilations alongside other Samurai Shodown games. It was ported to the PS1 along with its sequel under the name Samurai Spirits Kenkaku Shinan Pack. However, this port was only available in Japan. However, it would also appear in Samurai Shodown Anthology for the Wii, PS2 and PSP, along with its five direct sequels.Samurai Shodown, along with II and III, were also ported to the Wii's Virtual Console. All three were ports of their Neo Geo incarnations, making it unlikely that the SNES and Genesis ports of the game will be ported, as well.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Play As Amakusa[CR]Press right three times when the Takara logo is displayed.</plot>

		<plot>SD Gundam Winning History is a ? different game. Its like a strategy game in that you have various units you move around to attack your foes. However, when you actually engage your foes, the game switches to a side-view action style game, where you fly around the battlefield and attempt to shoot your opponent into smithereens. Which would seem to kind of eliminate the whole strategy part.[CR]Translation Description:[CR]The font is kind of crappy, but Dave plans to go back and make a new font for the game. So thats cool.[CR]Anyways, the games complete, so go have fun.[CR]Reviewer: wraith[CR]https://www.romhacking.net/trans/64/[CR]</plot>

The most significant change is the addition of red and yellow cards for discipline (2 yellow card offenses or one professional foul (denying your opponent a clear goal-scoring opportunity) results in that player being sent off). The goalkeepers have been improved in skill, and the 1994 World Cup Qualifying tournament was added.[CR]https://www.mobygames.com/game/game-gear/sensible-soccer-european-champions-9293-edition[CR]</plot>

He must be quick, so he can go back to a charity basketball game in downtown Tokyo![CR]Despite the game's smooth animation and crisp graphics, the game was widely panned for its difficult controls, inconsistent hit detection, and silly concept. The SNES version was also known for having less features than its Genesis counterpart (including five less playable fighters and three less stages).[CR]It was ported to the Amiga (in Europe only, developed by The Dome and published by Ocean), Sega Game Gear (developed by Tiertex and published by EA), and Game Boy (developed by Unexpected Development and published by Black Pearl) a year later. Ocean was also the sole publisher of the SNES version in Europe.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]For details on the characters, see the guide.[CR]</plot>

		<title_clean>Side Pocket</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Created especially for the US market by Data East (though later released in Japan), Side Pocket is a pool simulator that saw several different ports for the various consoles of the era. The game is set around the tournament scene and gets progressively more difficult as the player goes from venue to venue, eventually entering a global competition.[CR]The WonderSwan version is the last game that Data East released before their bankruptcy.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game controls like many pool simulators (as well as several golf simulators of the time) by allowing the player to select which direction they wish to hit the cue ball in, with a handy dotted line to indicate its trajectory, and then they must tap a button to start the power gauge and tap it again to stop at the desired level of power. The balls then move around and if a ball is potted (provided it wasn't the cue ball) then the player is able to take an immediate additional turn. Play continues until the 8 ball has been sunk.[CR]Side Pocket is notable for how it tabulates a player's score: As well as scoring points for winning the game, sinking several balls consecutively and sinking them in numerical order, there are occasionally times where a pocket will light up and the player is able to score a bonus if they're able to sink a ball in that particular pocket. These points are racked up at the end of the match and dictate the overall score.[CR]Occasionally there is an opportunity for a bonus trick shot after the game is over to score additional points. These tend to involve potting specific balls in specific pockets, sometimes while avoiding obstacles on the table.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR] Bart wakes up in the middle of the night and sees a UFO. He is the only one that knows about the alien invasion. Hence, he starts a journey to stop Aliens' evil plans and defend the earth. Although, this is the first Simpsons game, the plot has little to do with the show's material. Regardless, many of the show's characters make an appearance.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]In each level, Bart is faced with various objectives that he has to accomplish and certain items that he has to collect before proceeding to the level boss. These objectives vary in each level, and most of them reflect Bart's personality in the show.Bart can activate X-Ray vision to identify humans who have been abducted by aliens. By jumping on them, Bart can collect letters that form the name of the level assistant. If he forms the whole name, then that character will provide assistance in fighting the level's boss. For instance, in the first level, if Bart collects all the letters of "Maggie", she will help him fight Nelson, the level's boss, by throwing Bowling balls.There are various items that Bart can buy and use as weapons or to cause a special event. These items include Slingshots, Sprays, Rockets, Whistles, Magnets, Coins, etc. Some of the items are used in many clever ways. For instance, if players blow the whistle in front of the retirement home, Grandpa Simpson will come out and start throwing money.The game is considered to be very difficult. The lack of saves, continues, or check points increase the game's challenge. In addition, for each life, Bart can only be hit two times before dying; players only start with three lives. Finally, most of the enemies can only be avoided, not killed.There are numerous small additions and details added to the game; for example, in the third level (The Carnival), Players can take part in most of the carnival activities. Players can even buy a magnet and use it to cheat in the "spin the wheel" minigame.[CR][B]Levels:[/B][CR]Level oneLocation: SpringfieldBoss: Nelson MuntzHelper: MaggieLevel twoLocation: Shopping MallBoss: Ms. BotzHelper: MargeLevel threeLocation: CarnivalBoss: Sideshow BobHelper: LisaLevel fourLocation: MuseumSub-Boss: TyrannosaurusBoss: Dr. MonroeHelper: HomerLevel fiveLocation: Power PlantHelper: Maggie, Marge, Lisa, and HomerNo Boss[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Unlimited Lives[CR]When the TV screen appears during the game's intro sequence, press the following code:</plot>

		<plot>[CR]The story takes place after Bart wins a trip around the world on the show of Krusty the Clown. Mr. Smithers rigged the contest for Mr. Burns to get rid of his "worst enemies" the Simpsons. Burns hopes to do this by sending many agents to the different places where Bart will go (4 places in all: China, Egypt, the North Pole and Hollywood) where Bart has to survive the different attacks from the evil duo's agents.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]When the Game Gear version was released in 1993 Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the review scores of 7,6,7 and 7 out of ten. Sushi-X, who gave a 7 wrote, "This cart is a big improvement over previous Simpsons' titles for the Game Gear. The graphics are excellent and are very bright and colorful. The sounds are really good too. There is a lot more variety to the game play and the control is very responsive. Of course the humor of Bart and his wacky friends is rampant throughout the game. Overall this is another quality Game Gear cart and Simpsons' fans should take note".[CR]</plot>

Your objective is to draw face-down cards from one of four different piles and draw these cards into five different "hands" that are scored as traditional poker values. Hower the the hands may be scored in any combinasion... vertical, horizonal or diagonal on the game board... (where the bingo element comes into play).</plot>

		<title_clean>Sonic The Hedgehog</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Sonic the Hedgehog is a 16-bit  platformer released for the  Sega Genesis. It was the first game in the  Sonic the Hedgehog franchise, and also the first game developed by  Sonic Team. It was released in 1991 in North America, Europe and Japan. It is one of the best selling video games of all time, and thus a giant money maker for  Sega, creating a popular evergreen franchise and also propelled the Genesis to widespread popularity.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]As with most games of the era, the majority of the game's plot is contained within the instruction manual. Essentially, Doctor Robotnik is capturing all of the animals on Sonic's home of South Island to act as power sources for his robot army, and he desires the power of the six mystical  Chaos Emeralds to help further his world domination plot. Sonic doesn't like the sound of this, and sets off to rescue his animal friends and collect the emeralds before Robotnik.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]In the game the player takes control of Sonic (the Hedgehog) who is tasked with preventing Doctor Ivo Robotnik - or Doctor Eggman in Japan - from taking all 6  Chaos Emeralds in order to rule South Island, by instead collecting them himself. Sonic travels through 19 acts, split into 6 zones with 3 acts each (plus a one-act Final Zone). At the end of the third act of each zone the player fights against Doctor Robotnik in one of his many vehicles. The twist is Sonic's ability to run at extreme speeds which allows him to go through levels with loops, springs, high falls, and extreme slopes; and he must avoid rows of sharp spikes, bottomless pits, enemies, and other obstacles. Sonic has two attack moves: a spinning jump and spinning roll, and he can use both of these to combat enemies, break through certain walls, and smash open power-ups.[CR] Gold rings are scattered around the map - similar, but quite different, to  coins in  Super Mario Bros. Collecting 100 rings gives the player an extra life - similar to how collecting 100 coins in  Super Mario Bros. garners the player a  1up. Rings also act as a layer of protection against traps, as Sonic will drop all his rings upon coming into contact with a trap, only losing a life if he has no rings when it happens.Levels[CR]There are six different zones (levels) contained in Sonic The Hedgehog, each of which has its own unique aesthetic. There are three acts to each zone. They are: Green Hill ZoneDr. Robotnik, as the first boss in a Sonic game.[CR]This first zone sees the first appearance of some famous Sonic trademarks. Players whirl through checkered  loop-de-loops and speed past  palm trees against a vibrant and colorful background. At the end of act three, Dr. Robotnik shows up in a pendulum-like device that swings a large ball back and forth across the screen. Marble Zone[CR]This zone puts players in an ancient ruin that is apparently in close proximity to a  volcano. Players are forced to avoid  lava  lakes and waterfalls and they jump from platform to platform. After, Dr. Robotnik arrives with a  flamethrower mounted under his ship and proceeds to drop flames on the two platforms, which are on either end of the screen. Spring Yard ZoneThe Spring Yard Zone[CR]This mountainous zone places the player in a giant  pinball themed stage. Players must push through copious bumpers and avoid steep slopes as they make their way to the end of act three, where Dr. Robotnik waits. Here, he has a giant spike attached to the bottom of his ship and proceeds to break apart the platforms the player walks on, effectively making this battle harder the longer it goes on. Labyrinth Zone[CR]Here, players are put into an ancient maze that has sunken into the sea. This is arguably the most difficult stage in the game, as players are introduced to a new gameplay mechanic,  water. While submerged, the player can jump higher, but is slower and will drown if an air bubble is not consumed every so often. At the end of this zone, players must chase Dr. Robotnik through a vertical corridor, while avoiding  spears and, of course, the rising  water level. Star Light ZoneStar Light Zone[CR]This starry zone is set amongst an aerial construction site. Players will have to avoid some high-powered fans that will impede their progress, and will have to utilise others to advance in the level. At the end of act three, players will have to use see-saw like devices in order to hurls spike balls up at Dr. Robotnik, who will continuously drop spike balls down on the player. Scrap Brain Zone[CR]The final zone of the game is set in one of Dr. Robotnik&#8217;s grimy, polluted industrious cities. Players will have to avoid saws and traverse conveyor belts as they make their way through the level. In act three, players have to re-live an environment similar to that in the Labyrinth Zone. This area, however, has a certain touch of Dr. Robotnik about it. The water is polluted, and the walls a dull grey. Once players finish this, they will face off against Dr. Robotnik in the  final boss battle of the game. Here, there are four pistons. Two pistons will simultaneously move and try to crush the player, the doctor will appear in one of these and it is up to the player to use their reflexes in order to hit the right one.[CR]If the player completes the game with none or only a few Chaos Emeralds, Dr. Robotnik will taunt the player triumphantly juggling the leftover Emeralds and challenge the player to "Try Again." To get the good ending, the player will need to have obtained all 6 Emeralds, which can only be acquired from the game's 6 Special Stages.Secret Zones[CR]If the player has 50 or more rings at the end of any act, Sonic can warp to the secret zone by jumping through the giant golden ring. Sonic's  spin attack allows him to ricochet off the spinning  maze. The aim is to grab the  Chaos Emerald from the middle of the maze.[CR]There are six Chaos Emeralds to find, one in each of the secret zones, if the player collects them all it will unlock an alternative ending to the game.[CR]Items &amp; Objects[CR] Rings: As long as Sonic has rings he will not lose a life if he is hit by an enemy, he will simply spill the rings on the ground and he will have a time limited opportunity to recollect them. If he is hit when he has no rings, he will lose a life. Lamp Posts: The only checkpoint system in the game, when Sonic crosses through a lamp post the player's score and time are recorded. If the player loses a life Sonic will restart the current act at the last lamp post he activated.[CR](The following items are obtained by smashing video monitors with Sonic's spin attack)Super Ring: Equivalent to 10 or more rings.Shield: Protects Sonic from losing rings by protecting him from one attack.Power Sneakers: Enables Sonic to run at super sonic speed, and increases the tempo of the music to give an extra sense of speed. 1-Ups: Gives Sonic an extra live. Invincible: Makes Sonic invulnerable to enemy attacks for a short period of time.[CR][B]Soundtrack:[/B][CR]Music for Sonic the Hedgehog was composed by  Masato Nakamura, Bass Guitarist for Japanese Pop Music band Dreams Come True. Masato would mail each song on cassette to Sega's offices, where they would then translate the melody to a music format the Sega Genesis could understand. A number of songs submitted were based off of similar melodies found in popular Dreams Come True tracks.[CR]Development History[CR]Rabbit Concept Art[CR]On April of 1990 Sega held a contest internally among development teams in an effort to create a game to define the company. Sega's AM8 development studio (later renamed to  Sonic Team) decided that the game should be fast, but simple to control. Many design ideas were tossed around - a bulldog, a rabbit that picked objects up with his ears - but the decision came down to the act of the character rolling in to a ball and down hills to gain speed. It eventually came down to a hedgehog or an  armadillo - and in the end, the hedgehog won out. Initially called "Mr. Needlemouse", he was brought to Sega of America's marketing teams for further refinement.Very early concept art by Naoto Oshima.[CR]"Mr. Needlemouse" was originally the hard-edged lead singer in a rock and roll band, tasked with rescuing a groupie named Madonna, a human female who was apparently in love with the Hedgehog. Madonna was to be captured by "Dr. Badvibes", leading to our hero to leap in to action. Sega of America requested a number of changes, including tweaks to Mr. Needlemouse's look to soften up his thuggish appearance, the removal of the "rock band" aspect, and a name change to Sonic the Hedgehog.[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]Sonic was originally a light shade of blue, however testers had a difficult time telling Sonic apart from the blue sky. One of the last changes made to the game before being shipped was to change Sonic's palette to a much darker shade of cobalt in order to make him stand out better.Though the concept of a Rabbit that picks up and throws objects with his ears was rejected for Sonic, the concept was revisited by Sonic Team and eventually became  Ristar: The Shooting Star.The Armadillo concept also resurfaced later in  SegaSonic the Hedgehog for Arcades and  Knuckles Chaotix on the 32X, as the character  Mighty The Armadillo.The "Sonic the Hedgehog Rock &amp; Roll Band" concept was initially supposed to be kept for the game's fully-featured sound test mode, where Sonic and crew would play their instruments along with the game's soundtrack. This animation had to be removed in order to make room for the iconic "SEGA!" voice chime when the game first starts up, which Yuji Naka reportedly felt was a more impressive technological feat.Everybody has been "in a band" at some point in their life - even Sonic. Members of Sonic the Hedgehog's long lost Band include Sharps the Chicken on lead Guitar, Mach the Rabbit on Drums, Max the Monkey on Bass, and  Vector the Crocodile on Keyboards. Vector the Crocodile would return as a character in  Knuckles Chaotix, and later became a staple of the Sonic roster with games like  Sonic Heroes and  Shadow the Hedgehog.The Game Gear/Master System version of Sonic the Hedgehog still features an animated image of Sonic standing at a microphone for its Sound Test.Much of this game's art style was inspired by early 3D Graphics work. In the  Sonic Jam Official Japanese Strategy Guide (written personally by Sonic Team), Yuji Naka recalls that the team had a difficult time recreating the angular, vectorized 3D graphics visual style using hand-drawn pixel artwork.According to designer Naoto Oshima in an interview with  Gametap, Sonic the Hedgehog's design was inspired by  Michael Jackson's cool sense of style and  Bill Clinton's no-nonsense, "Get it Done" attitude. The color scheme for Sonic's trademark shoes were apparently inspired by Santa Claus' red/white motif.In one of the first Japanese television commercials for this game, Sonic is shown to pilot a spaceship where he drops a bomb on to what appears to be a parody of the Death Star, remade to look like Dr. Eggman's face. This concept was later re-used for Sonic the Hedgehog 2, where Dr. Eggman builds a nearly identical looking space station called the Death Egg.[CR]World Records[CR] Twin Galaxies is the world authority on video game world records and below are the variations/records tracked for Sonic the Hedgehog.812,140 [Tournament Settings, 5 Lives Only] by Michael Sroka38min. 12sec. [Minimalist Speed Run] by Jared Oswald1hr 3min 7sec [Fastest Full Completion, All Emeralds] by Jared Oswald[CR]SEGA Master System and Game Gear version[CR][B]Overview:[/B] and differencesMaster System Box Art[CR]Sonic The Hedgehog on the  Master System is similar to the Mega Drive/  Genesis version in some respects, but is overall a very different game.Unlike the 16-bit version Sonic cannot recollect rings after being damaged by an enemy.The Chaos Emeralds appear in the levels as opposed to appearing in the Special Stages which only contain rings.With the exception of Scrap Brain Zone (Act 3) no boss zones contain rings or  Badniks. This made the  boss fights much more difficult than they were on the 16-bit version of the game.The  Game Gear version features sign posts warning the player of upcoming  spike pits. This is because the Game Gear screen was much smaller and narrower than a TV screen, making the game slightly harder.[CR]There is one Continue hidden in each of the eight Special Stages, unlike the 16-bit version where gaining a Continue was based on the player's ring count.Levels[CR]Each level (also known as Zones or Rounds according to the back of the game box) are made up of three acts. The third act in each zone contains that zones boss which is always Dr. Robotnik in different machine. In addition to these levels there are eight Special Stages. These can be accessed by beating any of the first two acts of a level with 50 or more rings.[CR]Zones in play though order:Green Hill ZoneBridge ZoneJungle ZoneLabyrinth ZoneScrap Brain ZoneSky Base ZoneVaried level designs[CR]Sonic The Hedgehog on the Master System/Game Gear contains two zones that contain unique design elements for the series.[CR]The first one is Bridge Zone (Act 2) which features a  scrolling screen that moves independently of the player. This effectively forces the player to keep moving until the end of the zone, but also means that the player cannot speed through the zone in true Sonic style. The other unique zone is Jungle Zone (Act 2), which features a  vertical design rather than the traditional horizontal layout. The screen adjusts as Sonic moves up the zone but it does not go back down, so touching the bottom of the screen results in  instant death.[CR]Updated Releases[CR]GBA Release[CR]Sonic the Hedgehog was ported to the  Game Boy Advance in 2006. This iteration of the game features the same 6 zones, as well an added spin-dash move and a save feature. The graphics are not down scaled in any way, and look the same as the original Genesis version. This GBA port of Sonic the Hedgehog is considered to be very broken and inaccurately recreates the Genesis title, with choppy frame rate issues and graphical and collision errors.iPhone ReleaseThe iOS version of the game can be played using either touch controls or the accelerometer[CR]A port of the original Sonic the Hedgehog game was released onto the iPhone on May 20, 2009 by Sega America. The port features all of the original graphics and sounds and originally sold for $5.99 USD on Apple 's App Store. The controls for the iPhone version use a virtual D-Pad along with a virtual "A" Button. The iPhone and iPod Touch versions of Sonic the Hedgehog feature 7 different zones to play through. There are also two ways to display the game: Full Screen or "Arcade" mode.[CR]This version of the game was eventually updated and released as an iPad app as well.Android Release[CR]On May 16, 2013 the game was released to the Android platform, costing $2.99/&#163;1.99/&#8364;2.69/AUD$2.99, the same as the iOS version at the time of release. This version of the game was updated for Google&#8217;s mobile operating system with widescreen support and a 60 fps frame rate, as well as a remastered soundtrack, leaderboards and achievements. This update also allows players to unlock Tails and Knuckles as playable characters.[CR]SEGA also announced that the updates this iteration of the game debuted would be released to the iOS version of the game under the form of an update. An update released on May 16th in the US App Store, and on May 15th in certain international App Stores, read as follows:[CR]- Enhanced graphics, performance, and sound![CR]- New unlockable characters![CR]**Note: This is an all-new port of Sonic The Hedgehog! Unfortunately, saves from previous versions are incompatible with version 2.0!**[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Hidden ending[CR]There are one of two endings you can get when you complete the game.  One doesn't give full closure to the game's story but the other does.</plot>

		<plot>Dr. Robotnik has stolen all the Chaos Emeralds, yet again, but when the experiment for his new weapon goes wrong, the Emeralds get scattered across the island. While Sonic &amp; Tails are out searching for them, Robotnik finds the yellow emerald and convinces Knuckles the Echidna that Sonic wants to steal all the other Emeralds. While all this is happening, Nack the Weasel seizes his chance to take the emeralds for himself while everyone else is pre-occupied. Now it's a 4-way race to retrieve the emeralds.[CR]The gameplay is like the other Sonic titles, but this is only available on the Game Gear. The player can choose to play as Sonic or Tails (who can fly), and you're trying to reach the Chaos Emeralds before anyone else.

		<title_clean>Sonic The Hedgehog 2</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]A year after the original Sonic the Hedgehog, Sonic the Hedgehog 2 burst on to the scene. Sonic 2 is very similar to the original, but builds on many of the concepts and ideas introduced in the first title while piling on nearly twice the number of levels. The most drastic change was the introduction of a sidekick, Miles "Tails" Prower. The new character allowed a simple 2-player competitive mode, borrowing levels from the single player to add a much needed multi-player component. Tails could also follow Sonic around in single player mode, and could be controlled by plugging in a second Genesis gamepad.Sonic gets a sidekick.[CR]Arguably the most dramatic improvement is the implementation of the Spin-dash. By ducking and pressing the jump button, Sonic would rev up in ball form. After revving up enough, the player could stop pressing down to get a burst of speed while staying rolled into a ball. Beyond those two additions, however, gameplay for Sonic the Hedgehog 2 remains relatively the same; the goal is still to get to the end of a level as quickly as possible, while destroying as many enemies and collecting as many rings as possible. Rather than having three acts and a boss fight (as in Sonic 1), Sonic 2 features only two acts per level, with some exceptions (Metropolis Zone features three acts, Sky Chase, Wing Fortress, and Death Egg all feature a single act each).[CR]Chaos Emeralds also returned from the original, offering up an additional 7th Emerald (instead of the original game's 6). The special stages were done on a endless half-pipe which Sonic ran forward on collecting rings and avoiding enemies. If he had enough rings when he hit the checkpoint then he would continue until eventually obtaining a Chaos Emerald. Collect all 7 and Sonic would be able to transform into Super Sonic. In this form Sonic becomes even faster and rather than his usual blue is colored a bright yellow.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]Not content just exploring his home of South Island, Sonic the Hedgehog's adventures took him all over the globe. It was eventually he found himself at West-side Island, said to be home to a lost civilization. This civilization were given seven "Chaos Emeralds" of great power as a gift from the Gods. Eventually, this power corrupted the civilization, and this angered the Gods greatly. As punishment, they sealed the emeralds away in an alternate dimension called "The Special Zone".Sonic apparently didn't read the in-flight safety booklet.[CR]Intrigued, Sonic lands his biplane, the Tornado, on the island. It's here Sonic runs in to a shy, two-tailed fox named Miles - Sonic nicknames him "Tails" for obvious reasons. Tails, as it turns out, loves machinery, and he is fascinated by Sonic's plane. Before the two can get too acquainted, however, they hear an explosion in the distance. Doctor Ivo 'Eggman' Robotnik has followed Sonic to this island, and is tearing it apart looking for the Chaos Emeralds. He hopes they will act as an energy source for his greatest, most deadly creation: a giant, weaponized space station called the "Death Egg." Together, Sonic and Tails agree that Robotnik has to be stopped at all costs.[CR]Special Stage[CR]The Special Stage is played from behind Sonic in a 3D half-pipe. The player is given a target of the number of rings they have to collect as Sonic runs through the pipe whist avoiding the bombs. If the target is met then the stage continues, if not then the player returns to the level where they entered the Special Stage with a total of no rings. By meeting all the targets in the Special Stage, the stage is cleared and the player unlocks a Chaos Emerald. Each new Special Stage is harder than the one which preceded it and they have to be completed in order with no way to skip to the next one without completing the one previous.Tony Hawk ain't got nothin' on Sonic.[CR]After collecting all 7 Chaos Emeralds, compared to the total of 6 found in the Master System version, Sonic gains the ability to change into Super Sonic after collecting 50 rings. When Sonic becomes his super form he is virtually invincible, running and jumping much higher than normal, only able to be killed by drowning, being crushed, falling off the screen or by running out of time in the level. This added speed comes at a price as it makes it almost impossible to do precise jumps due to the increased speed as well as loosing 1 ring a second whilst in super form; with Sonic reverting back to his normal self when the rings reach zero and effectively making him a sitting duck to enemies.[CR]Two Player Versus Mode[CR]Sonic 2 also included a two versus player mode where, playing as either Sonic or Tails, two players can have a split screen race on one of 3 different zones or a Special Stage. In the regular zone races, on either Emerald Hill Zone, Casino Night Zone or Mystic Cave Zone, players are ranked in 5 different areas with the highest score winning the round. On the Special Stage the winner is the one who collects the most rings. In the case of a tie in the regular zones a Special Stage is then ran to determine a winner. Two player mode also added a couple of new item boxes. One being a teleporter which switched the two players around, the other being a Dr. Robotnik item which damaged the player that found it.[CR]Compatibility with Sonic &amp; Knuckles[CR]Sonic 2 &amp; Knuckles![CR]By slotting the Sonic the Hedgehog 2 cart into the top of the Sonic &amp; Knuckles Lock-on featured cart the player could play as Knuckles in Sonic 2. The game is essentially exactly the same with the player playing as Knuckles instead of either Sonic or Tails. He can glide and climb walls but due to his inferior jumping ability some boss fights are more difficult as Knuckles. There are a few minor differences in the way Star Post checkpoints are handled however as when returning to a level after a Special Stage the player would keep the rings they had before they went in, whereas in the default game all rings were lost. The same applies when a life is lost.Re-releases[CR]The Genesis version of this game was re-released on:Sonic Compilation on the Mega Drive in EuropeSonic 3-in-1 on the Genesis in North AmericaSega Smash Pack 2 on the PCReal Arcade on the PCSonic Mega Collection on the Nintendo GamecubeSonic Mega Collection Plus on the PS2, Xbox and PCSonic Genesis Collection on the PS2 and PSPWii Virtual ConsoleXbox Live Arcade MarketplaceSonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection for Xbox 360 and PS3[CR]Numerous mobile phone versions also exist.[CR]Zones[CR]Sonic the Hedgehog 2 has 11 zones, plus one special stage. This is twice as many as the original Sonic, which had 6 zones. However, a big difference this time around is that most of the zones have two acts instead of three. This is not a hard and fast rule though, as the Metropolis Zone had 3 acts and both the Death Egg Zone and the Wing Fortress zones had only one.Emerald Hill ZoneThe Emerald Hill Zone[CR]This zone is similar to the Green Hill Zone of the previous Sonic game. It&#8217;s set in a tropical resort that features many trees, green hills and wildlife-themed enemies. Dr. Robotnik appears here in a vehicle with a giant mechanical drill attached to the front. He travels back and forth in an attempt to impale the player, and due to this simplistic process, he is therefore relatively easy to defeat.Chemical Plant ZoneThe Chemical Plant Zone[CR]This zone is set in a bustling industrial city that is flooded with a neon pink liquid, Sonic can survive while submerged in this, but only for a limited time since there are no air bubbles. Dr. Robotnik makes his appearance with a suction tube clipped onto the bottom of his ship, which he uses to extract toxic materials from the liquid below, which he will then attempt to drop on the player. The player must attempt to avoid these attacks while remaining on the platform, which features panels that will successively rotate.Aquatic Ruin ZoneThe Aquatic Ruin Zone[CR]This zone is set in the half-submerged, swampy remains of a crumbling ruin. Players who fall into the water will find that they have a harder time than those who were skillful enough to stay dry, as the underwater path is significantly harder than the land path. Robotnik appears here with a giant mallet attached to his ship, he will hit down on two columns that flank the player on either side of street, causing them to shoot out arrows. The player must use these arrows as platforms in order to be able to reach Robotnik and bring him down.Casino Night ZoneThe Casino Night Zone[CR]This zone is reminiscent of the Spring Yard Zone of Sonic 1, in that it is set up to be a giant casino themed pinball table. Of course, this means the player must try and get past obstacles such as bumpers and slot machines in their attempt to reach Dr. Robotnik. He appears here at the bottom of a pinball table, with a set of electric pincers on the bottom of his ship. He uses this to drop bombs on the player, so staying on the ground is inadvisable. Instead, the player must spin dash up to, and utilize, the bumpers in order to hurl themselves at Robotnik.Hill Top ZoneThe Hill Top Zone[CR]This zone is set just above the clouds, on top of a set of hills. Sonic must cross over the top of the hills, and then delve down into it to face pools of magma and earthquakes, which makes the floor rise from under him. Here, the doctor emerges from the lava in a heat proof submarine with a flamethrower attached on top. He will repeatedly emerge from the lava and attempt to shoot the player with flames, which also sets the ground on fire. The player must strike out at Robotnik once he emerges from the lava, while avoiding the jet stream of flames.Mystic Cave ZoneThe Mystic Cave Zone[CR]This underground zone is set in a deep cave, which is covered in crystals. Sonic must swing from vines and avoid being crushed by crystals while they progress on their way to Dr. Robotnik. If the player manages to get through this stage, they are greeted at the end by Robotnik, who has a pair of drills attached on either side of ship. He uses these to drill into the ceiling and create sharp debris that will fall on the player if they&#8217;re not careful.Oil Ocean ZoneThe Oil Ocean Zone[CR]This zone is a giant oil refinery which features pools of thick oil that that the player can skim across. The oil is a double-edged sword, however, as while players can use it, if they are not careful they can sink into it and lose a life. Robotnik appears here in a submarine similar to the one he uses in the Hill Top Zone, but instead of a flamethrower, he now has a laser cannon that is much more lethal. Another new tactic he uses is that when submerged, he will send out a claw that travels over one of the platforms on the screen.Metropolis ZoneThe Metropolis Zone[CR]This is the only stage in the game to contain three distinct acts. This massive, construction themed, zone features corkscrews, copious spikes, magma and, of course, industrial themed moving platforms. After players make the lengthy excursion to the end of act three, they will predictably find Dr. Robotnik there. This time, he is surrounded by seven shaped pods, which rotate around him, creating a protective shield. Every time the player hits Robotnik, one of the pods will break off and transform into an inflatable copy of him, but these don&#8217;t pose a problem as they can be destroyed with a single hit. After all the pods have been destroyed, Robotnik will strafe across the screen with a laser beam. He is vulnerable in this state, however, as one more hit will send him packing.Sky Chase ZoneThe Sky Chase Zone[CR]This one act zone is set in the sky, as Sonic rides on top of Tail&#8217;s plane, the Tornado. Throughout the stage, Sonic&#8217;s partner will remain under Sonic wherever he goes, so falling isn&#8217;t a problem here. The player comes up against a variety of aerial themed enemies, but when they get to the end they will find that there is no boss in this stage.Wing Fortress ZoneThe Wing Fortress Zone[CR]Tails' plane, the Tornado, takes a hit and begins to fall to the ground. Sonic bails out and lands on Robotnik&#8217;s Wing Fortress. This flying citadel has many different traps and enemies, but the biggest threat to the player is falling off the screen, as this can be done a little too easily. Here, Robotnik has built a contraption to do the fighting for him. He locks Sonic within an energy field, and along with Sonic there is a laser cannon which strafes to and fro across the top of the screen, attempting to periodically fry the player. Along with the cannon, there are three flying spike platforms that bounce off the walls. The player must use these as a platform in order to reach and damage the sensitive cannon, while avoid their spiked sides.Death Egg ZoneMecha Sonic's first appearance, in the last stage of Sonic 2[CR]After the fight in the Wing Fortress Zone, Sonic chases Dr. Robotnik into the Death Egg. This, ringless, zone consists of two separate bosses. The first is Mecha Sonic, this doppelganger has some of Sonic&#8217;s moves, as he jumps and spin dashes across the stage. The player must hit him in the head while he stands still in order to damage him.The Final Boss, Dr. Robotnik[CR]After a few hits, Mecha Sonic goes down, and Sonic progresses into the next room for his final confrontation with Dr. Robotnik. The giant robot he appears in lumbers slowly around the arena, but the lower half of said monstrosity is invulnerable. The only way the player can reach the breakable upper half is to wait for the right moment. After trudging around for a bit, Robotnik rockets off the top of the screen, causing a target to appear over Sonic. When the target begins flashing, the giant egg bot is about to come crashing down. Immediately after landing, the machine lurches forward presenting the only safe opportunity to attack. But the player has to be careful as every other fall, he'll fire off his spiked arms which are near impossible to avoid unless Sonic is out of reach. After twelve hits Robotnik will go down, and the ending of the game begins.Hidden Palace ZoneHidden Palace Zone[CR]By using a Game Genie, it is in fact possible to get into the Hidden Palace Zone in the retail version on Sonic the Hedgehog 2. The code to unlock it is ACLA-ATD4 and then going into level select and pressing A and Start together when highlighting the Death Egg Zone. The level is obviously unfinished and cannot be completed without creating the Egg Prison item in debug mode. Bits of the level design seen in the numerous Beta versions of the game are still there including the infamous 'Master Emerald' block. All level art seen in previous Betas have been deleted presumably to save cartridge space and most of the textures as a result are just a glitched mess. In the background however, art from the Oil Ocean Zone can be seen. In the 2013 iOS and Android release of the game, this level was finally added into the game.[CR][B]Soundtrack:[/B][CR]Sonic the Hedgehog 2's soundtrack was composed by returning musician Masato Nakamura, bass guitarist for Japanese Pop-music band Dreams Come True. The song that plays after Sonic defeats the final boss (but before the credits roll) is in fact a karaoke version of a Dreams Come True song known as "Sweet Sweet Sweet" (or, as its known in America, "Sweet Dream"), from their triple-platinum album "The Swinging Star."[CR]Development History[CR]Sonic the Hedgehog 2 nearly did not happen. After completing Sonic the Hedgehog, Yuji Naka resigned from Sega of Japan. Sega of Japan paid its employees based purely on how long they had been employed at the company, and given that Yuji Naka was still relatively new, he was not being paid very much, despite having worked on one of the most prominent titles for the company. He was lured to America by Mark Cerny, who worked for the Sega Technical Institute (STI). STI was formed to help bridge the gap between the relatively new American game developers and the seasoned Japanese game developers. Yuji Naka and most of SonicTeam agreed to take part in this, and officially, Sonic the Hedgehog 2 was started at STI, featuring a mixture of Japanese and American developers and designers.[CR]Like the original Sonic the Hedgehog, a Character Design contest was held, this time to give Sonic a sidekick. The winner was Yasushi Yamaguchi's "Miles Prower" design. However, most of the team agreed that the character should be renamed to "Tails". Yasushi fought hard to keep the name as "Miles", even going so far as to make sure in-game art assets all read "Miles" instead of "Tails". Eventually, the team decided on a compromise - though the character's full name would be "Miles Prower", most people would call him "Tails" as a nickname.[CR]Initially, Sonic the Hedgehog 2 was planned for the Sega Genesis, Sega Game Gear (which was also ported to the Master System), and an enhanced port to the Sega CD. All versions of the game were slated to feature Time Travel in some capacity. As the projects went on, however, Sonic 2 for the Sega CD began to drift rather heavily from its Sega Genesis and Sega Game Gear counterparts. Eventually, Sonic 2 for the Sega CD was re-named altogether to become its own separate Sonic game, titled Sonic CD and Sonic 2 for the Sega Genesis dropped the Time Travel gimmick. Sonic 2 on the Game Gear existed as sort of a middle ground in between it all; it features remixes of music from the Japanese version of Sonic CD, and a plot where Tails gets kidnapped (instead of Sonic CD's Amy Rose). Unused footage for a Sonic CD video sequence gives a brief look at an Antlion Robot very similar to the first boss of Sonic 2 for the Game Gear.[CR]8-bit Master System/Game Gear Game[CR]Master System Box Shot[CR]A month before the release of the 16-bit Sonic the Hedgehog 2 for the Mega Drive/Genesis on October 29, 1992, an 8-bit game called Sonic the Hedgehog 2 was released for the Sega Master System on October 16, 1992. It was released exclusively for PAL territories, such as Europe and South America, regions where the Master System was popular. It was followed by a port to the Sega Game Gear handheld, in PAL regions on October 29, 1992, followed by a North American release in November 1992.[CR]Sega outsourced its development to Aspect, another Japanese company, which created a very different game from similar concepts.[CR]Being released before the 16-bit version for the Mega Drive/Genesis, the 8-bit editions of Sonic the Hedgehog 2 represented the debut of character Miles "Tails" Prower, who became a recurring character in the series.[CR]The Master System version was released for the Nintendo Wii's Virtual Console on November 18, 2008 in Japan, in North America on December 8, 2008and in the PAL regions on December 26, 2008.Storyline[CR]Tails has been kidnapped by the evil Dr. Robotnik. In order to guarantee his safe return, Sonic must stop Dr. Robotnik, thwart his evil plans, rescue Tails and retrieve the 6 Chaos Emeralds.Synopsis[CR]South Island has been peaceful since Dr. Robotnik's defeat. Sonic, bored, decides to go on a journey in search of other adventures. Upon his return, he is shocked to find the island nearly abandoned. The only clue as to where all his friends might have disappeared to is a single note, written by his two-tailed fox buddy, Miles "Tails" Prower. In the note, Tails explains that he's been kidnapped by Dr. Robotnik and is being held in a place called Crystal Egg. The price for Tails' safe return are the 6 Chaos Emeralds, to be delivered to 6 new boss robots. Thus, Sonic goes on a quest to find the Chaos Emeralds and rescue Tails.Gameplay[CR]The gameplay of Sonic 2 on the Master System/Game Gear was very different to the Genesis version. However, it was greatly updated in comparison to the original Sonic game also released on the Master System.[CR]It featured the ability to collect back up rings that Sonic had dropped when he was hit by an enemy as well as being able to smash through some walls by running into them. The game also featured levels where Sonic was required to ride along in a mine cart or fly a hand-glider. There was also a large bubble in the underwater levels which would allow Sonic to float upwards till he hit the ceiling or an enemy as well as the ability for Sonic to run on water provided he had enough speed; a feature absent from the 16-bit Genesis version of Sonic 2 but later implemented in Sonic 3.[CR]There were 7 zones in the game in total, each made of 3 Acts, with a prize panel being spun at the end of Acts 1 and 2 in which Sonic could earn an extra life. a continue, plus 10 rings or nothing, depending on which picture it landed on. Act 3 is the zones end level boss where Sonic must usually defeat a variety of robotic animals in order to proceed to the next zone.[CR]If the player manages to collect 5 Chaos Emeralds as they progress through the game, when they Mecha Sonic and defeat him they will be given the 6th Emerald and go on to fight Dr. Robotnik in Act 3 of the next and final zone, the Crystal Egg Zone. Defeating Dr. Robotnik here will unlock the "Good Ending". Failure to collect all 5 Chaos Emeralds before the encounter with Mecha Sonic will result in the game ending after his destruction and the player receiving the "Bad Ending" in which it is assumed that Dr. Robotnik has killed Sonic's friend Tails.Development[CR]Sonic the Hedgehog 2 received preview coverage in the October 1992 issue of GamePro.[CR]The Game Gear's lower screen resolution results in the Game Gear version having a smaller visible screen area than the Master System edition, causing some fans to consider the Game Gear version the more challenging title. For example, when facing the boss of the Underground Zone, the reduced screen area either side of Sonic gives the player less time to react to hazards moving onto the screen. Other bosses were also affected: the Green Hills Zone battle takes place in a smaller, steeper arena; there is a 3rd chute which cannot be seen while fighting Robotnik in the final Crystal Egg stage. The music for the intro sequence is also different. The Game Gear version uses the Scrambled Egg Zone music for the scene showing Robotnik escaping with the captive Tails and the Master System intro music for the title. The boss music is also different between the two versions. The Master System version used a single theme for the endings while a new good ending theme was added for the Game Gear version.[CR]The Game Gear version also features dark blue (instead of green) water in the second Act of the Aqua Lake Zone, and omits the game's only "Speed Shoes" item box, which may be found only in the Master System version of this stage. In the Game Gear version in power-up's original location is a Ring item box instead, thus rendering the item unused in said port.Soundtrack[CR]The music for Green Hills Zone was later used as the theme song for the Japanese and European versions of Sonic the Hedgehog CD, where it is called "Sonic: You Can Do Anything". A remix of the tune is also used for Mecha Green Hill Zone in Sonic the Hedgehog Chaos.Re-releases[CR]The Sega Master System/Game Gear game was re-released on:Sonic Mega Collection (2002) (GameCube, PS2, Xbox, PC)Sonic Adventure DX (2003) (GameCube, PC)Sonic Gems Collection (2005) (GameCube, PS2)[CR]The game was later re-released on Nintendo's Virtual Console service, with the Master System version released for the Wii Virtual Console in December 2008 and the Game Gear version released for the Nintendo 3DS eShop in June 2013.[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]The design for The Death Egg in this game most likely came from a Japanese TV commercial for the original Sonic the Hedgehog, wherein Sonic pilots a space ship to destroy a massive space station similar to Star Wars' own Death Star, but modified to look like Dr. Eggman's face.Early beta versions of the game reveal that, at one point, even more levels were planned for Sonic 2, including Wood Zone, a stage set in leafy tree tops, and Dust Hill Zone, a western-themed stage full of cacti and desert-dwelling robots. Hidden Palace Zone, not to be confused with the Sonic &amp; Knuckles stage of the same name, also exists in the beta version, along side an unplayable entry for a "Genocide City Zone". The stage "Neo Green Hill Zone" also exists, though selecting it from a stage-select menu takes Sonic to Aquatic Ruin Zone, possibly suggesting it originally went by a different name earlier in development.Interviews with various Sonic 2 graphics and level designers reveal even more cut levels never seen publicly: A recolored version of Dust Hill Zone to transform the sand in to snow, a Rock Zone, and a level called Cyber City Zone, possibly another name for Genocide City Zone. Genocide/Cyber City was supposed to take place between Metropolis Zone and Sky Chase, but time ran out - what work was completed on Genocide/Cyber City became Metropolis Zone Act 3.Level layouts from the cut level Wood Zone match up with level layouts for Metropolis Zone, possibly hinting at Sonic 2's now lost time travel feature. This suggests that Wood Zone would have possibly been what Metropolis Zone looked like in the distant past.Many of the resources made for deleted Sonic 2 levels eventually made it in to Sonic Spinball, another Sega Technical Institute game. Tiles for Hidden Palace Zone can be seen in the background for Toxic Caves, and graphics for a level called "The Machine" match up with concept art drawn for Cyber City Zone.Furthering the lost connection between Sonic 2 and Sonic CD, artwork of Sonic CD's "Little Planet" showcases areas on the planet that represent all levels present in the game, save for the top-right corner of the planet: A desert region, covered in cactus, reminiscent of this game's Dust Hill Zone.By collecting all seven chaos emeralds and fifty rings in a level, Sonic can transform in to the invincible Super Sonic form. Super Sonic is a bright golden yellow color with up-turned spikes, an obvious reference to Dragon Ball Z's Super Saiyan form. Yuji Naka was reportedly a big fan of Dragon Ball, and during his stay in America, had VHS tapes the latest episodes shipped to him weekly from overseas.Foxes, in Japanese folklore, are mischievous mythological beings sometimes refered to as a "Kitsune" (pronounced "Kit-Sue-Ney"). As a Kitsune ages, it grows additional tails, up to a maximum of nine. Additional tails on a Kitsune represent the level of mystical energy and intelligence within the being. Some stories say that a Kitsune will only grow a new tail every 1,000 years. A Kitsune with 9 tails is said to have infinite wisdom, and usually has fur that appears golden in color.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Hidden ending[CR]There are one of two endings you can get when you complete the game.  One doesn't give full closure to the game's story but the other does.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Hidden ending[CR]Follow the instructions given.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level Select[CR]On the title screen, hold Left+Down on the D-Pad as well as the A and B buttons.  When you see Tails blink for the third time (he first blinks one time, then two times quickly), press Start on the *third* time while his eye is closed.  If done correctly, you will reach the level select screen.</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Watch out! Escape![CR]Sonic the Hedgehog: Spinball (known in Japan as Sonic Spinball) is a hybrid 2D platformer/pinball video game developed by Polygames and published by Sega for the Sega Genesis on November 23, 1993. Players control Sonic the Hedgehog as a pinball (also controlling the various flippers around the stages), as he ventures through each of the four stages while collecting Chaos Emeralds and defeating the boss machines of Dr. Robotnik.[CR]The game is one of the two games to make use of elements from both the Sonic the Hedgehog and Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog cartoon series (the other game being Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine). The story involves Sonic infiltrating Dr. Robotnik's diabolical lair (the Veg-O-Fortress) on Mt. Mobius (thwarting his latest plan to turn the animals of planet Mobius into robots). This time, he must make use of Dr. Robotnik's new Pinball Defense System to navigate the lair.[CR]The game was later ported to the Sega Game Gear (on September 1994) and Sega Master System (Europe only on January 1995) by SEGA IDD.[CR][B]Stages:[/B][CR]There are four levels. In each level, the player has to collect all Chaos Emeralds to unlock the boss room. Defeating the boss clears the level. In between each level, players can enjoy bonus stages that consist of Sonic himself playing an actual pinball machine with three lives to complete a challenge, and which have slightly different physics from the main game. Each Bonus Stage plays at a specific time and do not have to be completed; even if the player loses at the Trapped Alive stage after completing the first level, they will still proceed to the Robo Smile stage after completing the second.Toxic CavesToxic Caves[CR]Boss: Scorpius[CR]Emeralds: 3[CR]After getting shot off Tails' plane in the intro movie, Sonic finds himself at the very bottom of the Veg-o-Fortress, a series of caves and sewers which have become polluted by toxic waste thanks to Robotnik's equipment. Most of the tables in this stage have safety mechanisms; the lowest one has a platform beneath the flippers from which Sonic can jump back up into the action (don't linger too long though, or you'll be eaten by a robotic sea monster!). Other tables feature a barrel floating in the river of lethal slime beneath the flippers, which Sonic can use as a makeshift boat. Once all Emeralds have been collected and the boss room opens, however, these barrels begin to move, pushing up the difficulty a notch. The boss of the level is the Robotnik-faced Scorpius, who leaks surprisingly un-harmful green goo from his tail, and is actually ridiculously easy to defeat.[CR]Bonus Stage: Trapped Alive[CR]In the first Bonus Stage, Sonic plays a machine containing seven miniature prison cages which hold representations of innocent animals and friends of Sonic. Sonic must hit each cage with a ball several times in order to break it and free the prisoner inside. However, a miniature Dr. Robotnik in his floating boss ship moves back and forth between the bumpers and the cages, attempting to block the balls and send them down the gutter. Once all the prisoners are free, hit Robotnik one more time with a ball to destroy his ship and win the stage. As in all Bonus Stages, you get three balls (lives) to complete the task, which does not reset when you lose a ball. In addition, Bonus Stages allow the player to "bump the machine" by pressing all bumper buttons at once, though this can Tilt the game, forcing them to lose their current ball. Notably, while the prisoners include Miles "Tails" Prower and assorted random animals, they also include Princess Sally Acorn, Bunnie Rabbot, and Rotor Walrus, characters from the Sonic the Hedgehog animated series; these cameos in Sonic Spinball are the only time characters from the show have appeared in an official game.Lava PowerhouseLava Powerhouse[CR]Boss: Robo-Boiler[CR]Emeralds: 3[CR]This stage is an energy plant where Robotnik transforms the heat from rivers of hot magma into power for the rest of the Veg-o-Fortress, so relatively common pits of lava are the greatest danger here. There are steam jets and pistons that Sonic can use safely, and several parts of the stage feature doors that the player needs to hit several times before they open, as well as helpfully-placed "shotguns" which fire Sonic directly into the doors. A pressure dial gauge ensures that the player does not advance before collecting all the emeralds. The boss is the Robo-Boiler, the artificial intelligence which oversees the Powerhouse. Its weak points are the cluster of Robotnik heads inside its main body, and while the Boiler itself is defenceless, it will summon an endless swarm of flying Clucks to get in the way and prevent Sonic from getting inside.[CR]Bonus Stage: Robo Smile[CR]In the second Bonus Stage, the grinning face of Dr. Robotnik moves back and forth on the table, and players must smash all four of his teeth by hitting them repeatedly with the ball. Players can also earn points for hitting the back of Robotnik's head, for getting the ball into his mouth by shooting it into a gap left behind by an already smashed tooth, and for hitting the targets lining the back of the table. Sonic earns a nice bonus every time he hits all three targets.The MachineThe Machine[CR]Boss: Veg-o-Machine[CR]Emeralds: 5[CR]Dr. Robotnik would never make a lair this big without including a roboticization machine for transforming innocent animals into mindlessly obedient Badniks, and the Veg-o-Fortress is no exception. In 'The Machine', Sonic must carefully make his way through the twists and turns of the incredibly elaborate, unusually enormous roboticization chamber, here called the Veg-o-Machine. But be careful, below the flippers is a set of grinding gears which poses the primary threat in this level. Teleporters abound, and the elevator sections really challenge the player's aim. At the centre of The Machine is an array of cages to bust. Freeing all animals is not required, but it does award the player a nice bonus. The boss of this level is the actual chamber where animals are roboticized; Sonic must get inside through the exit port in order to bust up the machine, but first he must destroy the tubes feeding captured animal prisoners into the chamber, because the constant flow of robots blocks the exit otherwise. Which is just fine, since he was going to do that anyway.[CR]Bonus Stage: The March[CR]The centre of the third Bonus Stage's table has an Egg Prison on it, the chamber found at the end of every level of Sonic the Hedgehogs 1 through 3 that frees imprisoned animals when a button on top is pressed. Since the ball in the Bonus Stage can't leave the ground, you're going to have to do this the hard way and smash all the side panels to destroy the Egg Prison. But robotic duplicates of Scratch (a character from The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog, another animated series) march endlessly in a circle around the Prison, and you'll need to destroy them first if you want to get to the cage.ShowdownShowdown[CR]Boss: Robotnik's Ship[CR]Emeralds: 5[CR]The Lava Powerhouse has been shut down, rendering the power level wildly unstable, and the Veg-o-Machine has been utterly destroyed, cutting off robotic reinforcements. Sonic's meddling has left the Veg-o-Fortress on the verge of collapse, but Robotnik still has a few Badniks up his sleeve as well as a backup plan, to flee in a rocketship into space. Sonic must pursue Robotnik through his space hangar and stop him from escaping. Despite this setting, there is no time limit, however this stage is by far the most merciless. A whole sequence of switches need to be triggered to activate the kickback for one of the deadly outlanes, and it is possible to fall out of the boss room with Robotnik's escape craft, requiring the player to fight their way back up before they can continue the battle.[CR]Secret Bonus Stage: Cluck's Defence[CR]Although the game ends when you complete the Showdown level, and there is no proper fourth Bonus Stage, a hidden Bonus Stage can be reached during any of the game's four levels: if Sonic collects every ring on a level, then circles of swirls will open up throughout the level (similar to the swirls leading to bonus stages that appear above Checkpoints in Sonic's platforming games). Jumping into the swirl here leads to a special Multiball Bonus Stage, where all three balls are in play at once. The actual objective is to destroy a crab robot in the back row by hitting him many times with the balls. However, two defensive Cluck robots move back and forth in front of him in the way Robotnik did in the Trapped Alive stage. Destroy the crab robot to win the stage, and you'll get a huge bonus to your score and be returned to the level you just left.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Cheat Codes.[CR]Go to "options" then "sound FX", and listen to the certain sounds to get their codes!

		<title_clean>Space Harrier</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Space Harrier (&#12473;&#12506;&#12540;&#12473;&#12495;&#12522;&#12450;&#12540; Sup&#275;su Hari&#257;) is a third-person rail shooter game. It was developed by Sega AM2 and created by legendary developer, Yu Suzuki, responsible for many popular Sega games. The game was published by Sega and originally released in the arcades in October 1985. Since then, the game has been released on a number of platforms and spawned many sequels.Using Sega's Super Scaler 16-bit graphics technology, the game produced pseudo-3D sprite-scaling at high frame rates, with the ability to scale as many as 32,000 sprites and fill a moving landscape with them, along with 6144 colors on screen out of a 98,304 color palette (15-bit RGB high color depth with shadow &amp; highlight).It also introduced a true analog flight stick for movement, with the ability to register movement in any direction as well as measure the degree of push, which could move the player character at different speeds depending on how far the stick is pushed in a certain direction. It also introduced a motion-based, hydraulic cockpit arcade cabinet, which moved in the direction the player moved the joystick. The game was also an early example of a third-person shooter; it was influenced by the earlier 1982 Sega game Buck Rogers: Planet of Zoom, and Space Harrier in turn influenced later 3D shooters such as Nintendo's Star Fox (Starwing) in 1993.Running on the Sega Space Harrier arcade system board previously used by Hang-On, the pseudo-3D sprite/tile scaling in the game was handled in a similar manner to textures in later texture-mapped polygonal 3D games of the 1990s. Yu Suzuki stated that his "designs were always 3D from the beginning. All the calculations in the system were 3D, even from Hang-On. I calculated the position, scale, and zoom rate in 3D and converted it backwards to 2D. So I was always thinking in 3D."[1] The game's success established Suzuki as the leading arcade game designer at the time.[2]Space Harrier later saw ports to many home game systems.Space Harrier's release on the Sega Master System home console is particularly notable, as there were two versions: one was a port of the arcade game, while the other, entitled Space Harrier 3-D (1988), supported the SegaScope stereoscopic 3D glasses. The game also spawned the sequel Space Harrier II (1988) and the spin-off Planet Harriers (2000).[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]"Welcome to the Fantasy Zone, get ready!"The game takes place in a unique place called the "Fantasy Zone" (no deeper plot is associated with Space Harrier). The Fantasy zone is a place filled with many strange creatures like one-eyed mammoths, alien pods, strange looking dragons, robots and flying mushrooms etc. The main character is a man with a giant gun/rocket that allows him to fly around. He runs along in a pseudo 3D level blasting anything that comes at him.The game has the player moving forward at all times and many enemies will get in the player's way, blasting projectiles and moving along in a certain pattern. The player must also do his or her best to move out of harm's way while shooting at anything that's presented on screen. Most objects are destructible, but some are not. If the player gets hit once, he or she will lose a life. The player starts off with two lives, and an extra life can be gained if the player racks up 5,000,000 points.The arcade version.The points will gradually increase as the player keeps moving. More points will be given for every thing that is destroyed by the player.There are eighteen stages in the game and a boss fight is presented in the end of sixteen of the stages. Two of the stages, stage 5 and stage 12, are bonus levels. The main character will jump on a dragon-like creature and destroy as many objects - trees, stone poles and bushes - as he or she can.Stages:The third stage, Amar.Stage 1: MootStage 2: GeezaStage 3: AmarStage 4: CiecielStage 5: Bonus StageStage 6: OlisisStage 7: LucasiaStage 8: IdaStage 9: ReviStage 10: MiniaStage 11: ParmsStage 12: Bonus StageStage 13: DrailStage 14: AsuteStage 15: VicelStage 16: NaturaStage 17: NarkStage 18: AbsymbelThe bonus stage.[CR]Arcade cabinets[CR]There were several different arcade cabinets. The first two were the standard upright and sit-down cabinets, which introduced the use of an analog flight stick that, for the first time, detected movement in 360 directions as well as the degree of push. The first port to feature similar analog stick controls was the version that appeared in Shenmue for the Dreamcast in 1999.The third was a new type of deluxe cabinet: the "rolling" cabinet. The "rolling" type moved the entire cabinet in the direction the player moved the analog flight stick, left/right and forward/backward, simulating flight movement for the first time in an arcade cabinet. The first port to simulate the rolling type deluxe arcade cabinet was Space Harrier 3D, which utilized the Nintendo 3DS's gyroscope motion sensor, in 2012.[CR]Sega Space Harrier arcade hardware[CR]The arcade hardware used to run the game is widely known as the Sega Space Harrier system, or less commonly known as the Sega Hang-On system. It utilized two boards: the CPU (Central Processing Unit) mother board, and the Super Scaler graphics board which handled the game's complex sprite-scaling. The game displayed 128 sprites per frame, at 60 frames per second, scaling 7680 sprites per second. The graphics board itself is capable of scaling up to 32,000 sprites per second with more memory, as was the case with later Super Scaler titles.Technical specificationsCPU (Central Processing Unit) mother boardMain CPU processors: 2x Motorola MC 68000 (16/32-bit) @ 10 MHz each Performance: 3.5 MIPS (Million Instructions Per Second)Additional CPU: Intel 8751 (8-bit) @ 8 MHzSound CPU: Zilog Z80 (8-bit) @ 4 MHz Performance: 580,000 IPS (Instructions Per Second)Stereo sound chips FM (Frequency Modulation) synthesis chip: Yamaha YM2203 @ 4 MHz Channels: 3 FM channels, 3 SSG (Software-controlled Sound Generator) channelsPCM (Pulse-Code Modulation) chip: SegaPCM @ 8 MHz Channels: 16 PCM 8-bit channels @ 31.25 KHz sampling rateRAM (Random Access Memory) Program RAM: 32 KBAudio RAM: 2 KBROM (Read-Only Memory) Program EPROM (Erasable Programmable ROM) memory: 448 KBAudio EPROM: 192 KBAudio ROM for PCM audio samples: Up to 16 MBSuper Scaler GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) boardGPU: Sega Super Scaler 171-5320 graphics card Sega 315-5011 sprite line comparitorSega 315-5012 sprite generator2x Sega 315-5049 tilemap chipsSega PAL chipset: 2x Sega 315-5107 horizontal timing controlSega 315-5108 vertical timing controlSega 315-5122 timing chipDisplay resolution: 320 x 224 pixelsColours on screen: 6,144Colour palette: 32,768 (15-bit colour)Frame rate: 60 frames per secondSprites displayed per frame: 128Sprites displayed per second: 7680Sprites scaled per second: Up to 32,000Hardware layers: 2 tile layers1 text layer1 sprite layer with hardware sprite zooming1 road layerTranslucent shadowsVRAM (Video RAM) memory: 192 KB high-speed SRAM (Static RAM)Graphics EPROM: 1152 KB[CR]Console ports[CR]The game was ported to several Sega consoles, such as the Sega 32X, and Sega Saturn. It also found its way to numerous computers and consoles of its era, often with various compromises in quality. The 32X version is one of the earliest ports to match quality with the arcade game, though even it cuts a couple of corners here and there. The Saturn version, released in Japan as "Sega Ages: Space Harrier" is also a pretty faithful version of the game. This version of the game also appeared in the US with two other games on a compilation disc simply called Sega Ages.The two Master System versions, including Space Harrier 3-D, reduced the graphical quality and speed quite a bit, but still managed to be a recognizable port of the original game. The first Master System version, released in 1986, was the first home video game cartridge to feature 2 Megabits (256 Kilobytes) of memory. The second Master System version, Space Harrier 3-D, featured the use of stereoscopic 3D graphics. The Master System versions also contain a new final boss fight against two glowing dragon creatures known as "Haya Oh." This new boss fight also appears in the X68000 version of the game. The Game Gear version of the game shares some of the basic quality issues as the Master System release, but contains different levels, an adjusted resolution, and a password system for continuing from later levels.Space Harrier, featured in Shenmue.The game was also featured in the game Shenmue. Space Harrier was located in the "You Arcade" building in the Dobuita area of the game; the player has to pay one-hundred yen to play the game. The "Sega Saturn" version of Space Harrier was also featured as a prize in the raffle in some of the convenience stores. The Sega Saturn version can be played on Ryo's Sega Saturn that is located in his living room.A polygonal remake of the game was made as part of Sega's Sega Ages series in Japan. The polygonal version of Space Harrier was released outside of Japan in the form of Sega Classics Collection.[CR][B]Reception:[/B][CR]Arcade versionThe arcade game was well received upon release. It became one of 1986's chart hits in the arcades. Computer and Video Games magazine reviewed the arcade game in its March 1986 issue, after reviewer Clare Edgeley played it at the 1986 ATEI (Amusement Trades Exhibition International) show in London, along with the arcade version of Super Mario Bros. She stated, "Perhaps the games to steal the show were" Space Harrier along with Shrike Avenger (1986), praising their hydraulic cockpit cabinets that "twist, turn and move" in the same direction as the joystick, making them "the most realistic" simulators "to date". She praised Space Harrier's "excellent graphics" for being "all in 3D with amazing technicolour landscapes" and a "multitude of objects" on screen, as well as "the sounds of the battle" output by "large speakers" where "you could almost lose touch with reality". She also praised the gameplay for being "exciting" and "very fast" paced, as well as the continue feature, but stated the game can be "very difficult."Clare Edgeley gave the arcade game a retrospective review in the February 1987 issue of Sinclair User, where she noted it had one of the first hydraulic arcade cabinets she had seen, along with 1986's Shrike Avenger. She stated that Space Harrier's "fabulously colourful 3D graphics" and "the movement of the sit-in cabinet were, and still are, breathtaking", noting "the seat-belt" and "turbulent" ride which "hurls you up, down, left and right" and tilts "the cabinet in a roll in whatever direction you push your joystick", concluding the game to be "great fun."Home conversionsReview scoresPublicationScoreComputer and Video Games70% (C64)68% (ZX)40% (CPC)[3]CRASH77% (ZX)Famitsu34/40 (3DS)Sinclair User (ZX)Your Sinclair9/10 (ZX)The Milwaukee Journal9/10 (SMS)AwardsEntityAwardGolden Joystick AwardsGame of the Year (Runner&#8209;Up)The home conversions were also well received. The game was runner-up in the category of Game of the Year at the 1986 Golden Joystick Awards.The Milwaukee Journal in May 1987 gave the Master System version a positive review, rating it a score of 9 out of 10. The reviewer Edward J. Semrad described the Master System version of Space Harrier as "the latest innovation" and "the most powerful cartridge ever made for any computer or game system." He concluded it "sets new standards in audio, graphic detail, memory and price ($40 list)."The September 1988 issue of Computer Gaming World (page 50) called Space Harrier "the best arcade shoot-'em-up of the year ... as exciting a game as this reviewer has ever played".[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]The flying furry creature in the bonus stages is very similar to Falkor, the flying dog-dragon from the 1984 film, The NeverEnding Story.

		<plot>The city of New York is certainly a great place to be, but not when there's the criminal element running about. Lucky for the NYPD, there's also the heroic Spider-Man on their side![CR]But now one of the biggest criminals in the city, Wilson Fisk, a.k.a. The Kingpin, has pulled of the ultimate plot! He announces to New York that a bomb has been planted somewhere in the city, and that it'll go off in 24 hours! What's worse, he lays the blame on Spider-Man, and now the webslinger is on his own, and on the run from the police. Spidey smells a rat, and he knows what he must do.[CR]Spidey has 24 hours to find and disarm that bomb. And he must also clear his name, so he takes his camera to take convincing photos for his Spider-Man hating boss, J. Jonah Jameson, and the police, to prove his innocence. Along the way, he just may run into a few of his *AHEM* "old friends", including Dr. Octopus, Electro, Mysterio, and ultimately Kingpin himself![CR]https://www.mobygames.com/game/game-gear/amazing-spider-man-vs-the-kingpin[CR]</plot>

		<plot>Sports Trivia: Championship Edition is a mix of football and sports trivia.  The main premise of the game is set on a football field, choosing plays on either offense or defense they than are answered a series of sports-related trivia questions.  Answering more questions correctly in a certain amount of time will determine how well their quarterback will pass or how many yards their running back will gain.  Alternatively, the same applies to the defense where if a player answers more trivia questions correctly, the better the chance of a sack, interception, etc.[CR]There are eleven different sports categories that range from football, baseball, hockey and boxing clear up to college sports and even auto racing.  Each question is given in multiple choice format and players are allowed five audibles (an alternate question) for each half.  The player has the option of either competing against the computer A.I. or against a friend.</plot>

		<plot>Beyond the Nexus is based on the seventh Star Trek movie and its story: Captains Kirk and Picard must team up to stop a mad scientist from destroying an inhabited planet so that he might reenter the mysterious Nexus energy ribbon.[CR]The game has several different playing modes. The first is starship combat: seen from the main screen of the Enterprise (both the -B or the -D version) you navigate the ship through space, firing phasers or photon torpedoes at enemies like Tholians, Klingons and Romulans. Another mode has you navigating the ship to its destination by flying through rectangles in space.[CR]On away missions, the view switches to a top-down perspective where you control a single character and can fire your phaser at enemies.[CR]Finally, the game has two puzzle modes. In the first one, frequencies must be decoded: this is done by putting symbols into the right order. One can only guess the order at first, but after an attempt the game reveals how many of the selected symbols are part of the combination and how many are in the right place. Using logic, the right order can be determined, but there are only a limited number of tries.[CR]The second puzzle mode is used to reroute power from one system to another. To do so, a path must be built on a grid for the energy to flow through. The path must be built out of randomly assigned pieces that don't always fit together, similar to the concept of Pipe Mania.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level Passwords[CR]Enter these on the password screen found from the main menu.</plot>

		<title_clean>Star Wars</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]This game is based entirely on the first Star Wars movie, Episode IV: A New Hope. The opening of the game features an animated cinematic of the opening scene of the film. After that the player takes control of  Luke Skywalker, driving the  landspeeder across  Tatooine in search of  R2-D2.   Luke Skywalker explores various locations throughout Tatooine, fighting numerous enemies including Jawas and Stormtroopers. The game features many locations from the movie including the Chalmun's Cantina in Mos Eisley where Luke meets Han Solo for the first time. This section of the game features a classic 8-bit rendition of the "Cantina Band" theme as played by the fictitious band, Figrin D'an and the Modal Nodes, in the feature film. The game also contains many famous lines from the movie including Obi-Wan Kenobi's plea to Luke to join him in his trip to Alderann and Han Solo's description of the smell from the Death Star's trash compactor.   The player eventually lands on the  Death Star and has to destroy the tractor beam to escape. The game also features first person segments of piloting the  Millenium Falcon through that Asteroid field that was once  Alderaan, and shooting down  Tie Fighters in both the Millenium Falcon and an  X-Wing fighter. The finale of the game features a top down view of Luke Skywalker's X-Wing flying through the Death Star trenches. After the player successfully fires a torpedo into the Death Star's exposed exhaust port, a cinematic of the Death Star exploding and Luke Skywalker being awarded a medal on Yavin IV is shown. The game featured the characters Luke Skywalker,  Han Solo,  Obi-Wan Kenobi,  Princess Leia, R2-D2, and C-3PO. The game however does not feature  Darth Vader or  Chewbacca, both of whom are major characters in the film.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Stage Select[CR]At the Title Screen press Right, Up, Down, Right, Up, Down, Right, Up, Down, Right, Right, Right. A sound will confirm proper entry. Beat stage 1 (you will have infinite lives). On stage 2 die, and you will notice a stage select at the continue screen.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Invincible Han[CR]When you first get Han Solo (he's inside the Cantina in the Mos Eisley level), immediately switch over to him and allow him to die. You should restart as Luke in the spot where you first found Han. Now exit and re-enter the Cantina. Make your way back to where Han was and you will obtain him again. This time however, Han's health bar will start completely depleted and you will not die from normal enemy or environmental attacks. Note- The Invincible Han effect will be removed if you: 1.) Pick up a health pack with him 2.) Use Obi Wan to resurrect him or Leia 3.) Suffer fall damage.</plot>

		<title_clean>Stargate</title_clean>
		<plot>The handheld version of Stargate is a matching puzzle game, similar to a 3-D  Tetris. Players drop tiles into a Stargate, and try to stack three identical symbols. Doing so clears those tiles. Mismatched tiles simply build stacks higher and higher, and the player loses if the tiles reach the top of the gate. The player is also given a seven-symbol Stargate "address" along the top of the screen. Stacking three copies of a symbol listed in the address will clear the stack and counts toward completing the address.[CR]There are two game modes building on this basic concept:[CR]1. Skill Mode is a single-player challenge where the player tries to complete as many addresses as they can before being overwhelmed. Speed increases with completed addresses.[CR]Battle Mode can be played against the computer, or against a second player connected with a link cable. In Battle Mode, any stacks you clear are sent through the Stargate and appear on your opponent's side. A height level meter is added on the sides to show how close you and your opponent are to overflowing their gates. You can win by outlasting your opponent (while sending complete stacks through to make things more difficult for them) or by being the first to complete the address.</plot>

		<plot>In February 1991, The United States of America sent troops into Kuwait and fought in armed combat against the forces of Iraq. Operation Desert Storm featured many different types of units including mobile armor. The M1 Abrams tank division is deployed in a variety of missions to destroy marked Iraqi targets.[CR]Super Battletank: War in the Gulf is a 1st person tank simulation. Players sit in the cockpit to of a M1 Abrams tank. Controls allow the player to accelerate forward, decelerate, rotate the tank's trajectory left and right, move the tank's cannon left and right, fire the weapon and check the map. The goal of the player is to travel to the location of enemy targets, line them up with the Abrams cannon and fire upon them until destroyed. Each mission covers a large area of land and the player will need to consult the real-time map to travel appropriately to target locations. The M1 Abrams tank also features 2 special weapons: The laser which is more powerful than regular cannon, and the smoke screen which allows the player to escape.</plot>

		<plot>Super Columns is an updated version of Columns with more options of play, but with the same setup, maneuvering falling blocks into groups of three or more to eliminate them from the screen.  Along with a Versus mode there is also a Story mode as well.[CR]An evil sorcerer by the name of Surhand has stolen a mystical amulet which brings peace and serenity to the land of Phoenicia and hopes to use it to bring death and destruction to the land.  The player must battle their way through his four guards in a series of best two-out-of-three games of Columns in order to face off against Surhand and bring peace back to the land.[CR]The Flash Mode also returns to this version as well as the new Endless Mode where the main objective is to score as many points as possible before the timer runs out.  There are also special columns throughout these modes such as Glitter Columns which eliminates all blocks of the same color on the screen at once as well as Stone Block Columns which can only be eliminated through magic power-ups that can be obtained by eliminating the base blocks.</plot>

		<plot>[CR]The game was released in arcades in 1989 and for the Sega Mega Drive in 1990 and is an arcade racing game in the style of Formula One.[CR]Although the original arcade version of the game consisted of the one circuit, a re-imagination of the Circuit de Monaco, the Sega Mega Drive port has a world championship mode, which consists of 16 race weekends. The 1989 F1 season is used as a basis for circuits and drivers, although the drivers only loosely resemble the real world counterparts.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The arcade version of the game was simpler in design than the Mega Drive counterpart, featuring only the one track. The player chooses between automatic or manual transmission and then begins qualifying. The player must qualify in under 45 seconds to progress to the race. In the race mode, the player must stay in front of a certain position in the field. This begins at 20th, but increases as the player reaches checkpoints, finally ending at 3rd place.[CR]In the Mega Drive version, The player can fail to qualify and begin the race from the back of the grid.[CR]The World championship mode, not featured in the arcade version, gave the goal of winning a season, with points being awarded similar to the real life sport. To add replay value, one the season is over the player goes on to defend the title. In the second season the player is given a seat at the games fictional super team, and is assigned a difficult rival.[CR]In this mode, the player drives for team Minarae, and is able to choose another driver as his rival. If the player beats the rival in 2 consecutive race weekends, the rivals team will offer a place to the player. This allows the player to drive for faster cars, and acts as a difficulty curve.[CR]If the player wins two championships, the game is considered over.[CR]Drivers[CR]Class ADriver NameDriver TeamReal world DriverReal world Equivalent TeamA.

However, all advertisements were misspelled and altered with the exception of an advert for another Sega Game.[CR]Pressing A, B, and C as you cross the finish line changes the trophy ceremony. The Driver will hold his head in his hands instead of lifting the trophy.[CR]The game was the first racing game to have a rear-view mirror.[CR]</plot>

		<title_clean>Super Off Road</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Super Off Road is the console adaptation of the Ivan "Ironman" Stewart's Super Off Road Arcade racer. These versions lack the Ironman license, but the gameplay is all but identical. The player, along with either another human player or up to three AI opponents, race around a single-screen track in a format similar to Atari's Super Sprint. The player can upgrade their car's stats with the money earned after each race, or purchase more Nitro for one-off speed boosts.[CR]Different versions have different features. The SNES version has twice as many tracks as the original Arcade game (sixteen rather than eight), and the NES version allows up to four players to play with the NES Satellite or Four Score peripherals.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]When the Game Gear version was released Electronic Gaming Monthly issued the following scores, 5,6,4,5 adding, "...after a while it does get tough on the eyes and I found I could not play for very long. The truck controlled well and was faithful to the arcade game, but just too small.".[CR]</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The Evil Colonel Chi[CR]Surf Ninjas is a third person side scrolling platforming game for the Game Gear. The player plays as the older of the two brothers with the younger brother providing hints. After doing so they player goes from level to level as they progress to the island of Patu San where they will confront Colonel Chi.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The Jump Meter at the Upper Left and the Health Meter Right Below it.[CR]Much in the vein of Double Dragon, Surf Ninjas is a horizontal combat platformer. As the player navigates the environment they will encounter enemies which the player can usually avoid by just jumping until they reach the boss which the player must defeat. Jumping does feature prominently in the game in the form of the jump meter. As the player jumps continuously they deplete their jump meter until they can only do short and low jumps. In order to traverse certain parts of the game (i.e. crates) they player needs to have a full jump meter forcing them to pace and moderate their jumps with a certain amount of precision. The player can also do a double spin jump higher jumps by tapping the "2" button twice and holding it on the second tap. On top of this the play can also throw fireballs or shurikens as well as equip bladed weapons. Finding random triangles will give the player the ability to summon Zatch a warrior ninja who can instantly defeat any enemy on the screen.[CR]In the options menu the player can go to the options menu at anytime to select weapons or check their character status. They can also go to the menu to ask Adam (the younger brother) for a hint. When selecting this option Adam will pull out his Sega Game Gear and a hint will appear on the screen of the in-game Game Gear.[CR]Relationship to the Movie[CR]Yup, the Sega Game Gear in a Sega Game Gear game.[CR]Surf Ninjas is an early example of a video game/movie tie in however Surf Ninjas takes this concept one step further. Sega of America wanted to have the Game Gear featured prominently in a film as a form of advertising for the platform. After contacting New Line Cinema the idea of Surf Ninjas seemed appropriate and Sega began development of the video game version of Surf Ninjas when the writing and story boarding process for the film had barely begun. While they received input from the director and writer of the film the developers took many liberties and released the video game weeks before the film's release.[CR]</plot>

		<title_clean>Sylvan Tale</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Sylvan Tale is an action role-playing game released for the Game Gear on January 27, 1995, exclusively in Japan. Sylvan Tale was developed and published by Sega, and follows a young boy named Zetts on a quest to save the land of Sylvalant. The game is similar in style to other handheld action role-playing games, notably The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages/Seasons.A page from the game's manual displaying a few of the characters.[CR]A fan translation of Sylvan Tale into English was released by ROM hacking team Aeon Genesis (known for their translations of games such as Shin Megami Tensei and Star Fox 2) on September 8, 2001.[CR]The plot of Sylvan Tale follows Zetts. At the start of the game, Zetts discovers a magical tree that transports him to another land, where he must recover the six Droplets (magical shards from another world). After collecting the six Droplets, as well as two magical "Prisms," he faces off against Moa, an evil wizard whose intentions included murdering Zetts' mother (Queen of Sylvalant), calling Zetts' mother a whore, and taking over the world.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Sylvan Tale is a fairly conventional top-down action role-playing game. The player controls Zetts, who starts the game with a simplistic sword attack. Zetts is able to attack enemies with Button 2, and pull and push objects with Button 1 (e.g. boulders or stone blocks to activate buttons). Zetts can also interact with the environment, use equipped items (e.g. magic "life powder" to regrow fallen trees), or talk to non-player characters to progress the story.The Flame Labyrinth[CR]The game has a total of eight "main" dungeons, each containing another Droplet. Most of these dungeons also house a boss, which are sometimes aided the usage of that dungeon's ability or item. There are several different types of items collected: "slabs" or "tablets" containing new abilities, regular items, or healing/health upgrading items. Each tablet gives Zetts a new ability that is selectable in the pause screen, all of which can be used outside of dungeons as well. Items include objects such as flowers (which can be used to cheer up non-player characters), a compass (to guide Zetts through a maze), and a lamp (to light up dark dungeons).TabletsTurtle Armor - The first slab that can be obtained in the game, the Turtle Armor gives Zetts the ability to shield himself from oncoming attacks, and also to use some fire traps to launch himself into the air. The upgraded version gives Zetts a dash ability, which helps to avoid spike traps, break down barriers, and attack enemies.The selection screen for Zetts' abilities.Mole Suit - The mole tablet gives Zetts the ability to break down rock barriers as a mole. The upgraded version of the Mole Suit also allows Zetts to dig underground at certain marked spots.Merman Formula - Once obtained, Zetts automatically transforms into a merman when leaping into the water. This simply allows him to swim in the water, and has a simplistic trident attack for swimming enemies. The upgraded version gives Zetts a diving ability.Mouse Spell - The fastest transformation of all the tablets, the mouse slab allows Zetts to move incredibly quickly, and access small doors. As a mouse, Zetts has a very weak attack, and with the upgrade Zetts is able to manipulate magnetic balls in some dungeons.Bird Feathers - A hidden ability, this gives Zetts the power of flight. There is no attack nor upgraded version for this ability, but it does allow Zetts to completely forgo fighting enemies, dodging obstacles, etc. It also is a way to avoid one of the game's eight labyrinths.ItemsLamp - The lamp lights up dark dungeons automatically when equipped, giving the player a small, circular view.The item selection screen.Flowers - The flowers are given to the player by Feeta, a young girl tending to a garden by the Jungle Labyrinth. They cheer up non-player characters in the game, helping Zetts to gain the Mouse Spell.Compass - The compass is essential to completing the Jungle Labyrinth, guiding Zetts through a maze by pointing which direction is the correct way to go.Hourglass - The hourglass briefly freezes time (for five seconds) when the player steps on a corresponding button with the item equipped.Verda/Flora Rift Keys - The "Rift Keys" allow Zetts to traverse between the game's three worlds: Verda, Flora, and Sylva. This is done by accessing a teleportation panel inside each world's Great Tree.Life/Purifying Powder - The Life Powder (and its upgraded version) allow Zetts to heal fallen trees and purify poisoned water.Amulet - The amulet is given to Zetts by Queen Rui (later revealed to be his mother). It allows him to open up the pathway to the final dungeon.Fruit - Fruit is used as a healing item/health upgrade in the game. Apples, cherries, and grapes all heal Zetts to varying amounts, while oranges increase Zetts' total health capacity.LabyrinthsFlame LabyrinthAnn's LabyrinthLake LabyrinthJungle LabyrinthWaterfall LabyrinthDesert LabyrinthSwamp LabyrinthGol's Labyrinth[CR]</plot>

		<title_clean>T2 - The Arcade Game</title_clean>
		<plot>As the title states, this is the home conversion of the arcade rail-shooter based on the film Terminator 2: Judgement Day. Up to two players shoot through future and present levels as robotic killers reprogrammed to serve the human resistance. [CR]Both players wield a machine gun with infinite ammo that lowers its firing rate (overheats) as it is continuously fired. A secondary weapon (missile launchers in the future, shotguns in the present) has limited ammo but deals heavy damage. Powerups inside the game world include secondary weapon ammo and coolant for the machine guns, and are shot to be collected.[CR]T2: The Arcade Game features seven levels based on specific scenes or general concepts in the film. The first four levels act as a prelude, as the player guns down waves of metal Terminators across a post-apocalyptic Battlefield, a besieged Human Hideout, and through the security checkpoints of the enemy supercomputer SkyNet. After destroying the computer, players travel back in time to protect John and Sarah Connor, while also destroying every scrap of SkyNet research at the headquarters of its manufacturer. From there, players must fend off the indestructible T-1000 until the final showdown in the Steel Mill.[CR]Assets from the movie are used when possible, such as voice clips from Arnold Schwarzenegger, and close-up digital stills of Robert Patrick for the final battle against the T-1000. The Genesis and SNES versions also support lightguns (the Menacer and Super Scope, respectively).[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Unlock Cheat Menu[CR]Go into the options menu highlight Music.</plot>

		<plot>Before Tails met Sonic the Hedgehog he lived on Cocoa Island, a place that isn't on the map. It's an island pulled up by the Chaos Emeralds. Suddenly, while relaxing, Tails hears an explosion that seems like it's coming from inside the island. A Flicky tells Tails that Battle Kukku has invaded the island. He also tells Tails that Battle Kukku is mining here for the Chaos Emeralds, to obtain it's power. Tails gears up and heads for his quest to find the machine parts to build his weapon to defeat the evil Battle Kukku. There are however major plot differences between the Japanese and the western release. In the US and European version of the game it tells the story how Sonic and Tails decide to go separate ways for a while. Tails finds an unknown island and decides to dub it Tails Island. While resting there, a large explosion occurs and a Flicky tells him birds are invading the island.[CR]Unlike the other games in the series, this spin-off is less of a traditional platformer, but has a much slower pace with rpg elements and a focus on puzzle-solving. Tails can walk, jump, fly (momentarily), hang on ledges and throw bombs. He starts with ten health points that can be replenished with rings, but the amount can be extended to 99 by collecting chaos emeralds. In the twelve stages Tails can collect up to 26 items. Per level however, he is only allowed to bring along four and this adds a tactical dimension. One of the most vital tools is the Remote Robot that can squeeze through small areas that Tails cannot reach. Underwater he changes into the small submarine Sea Fox.[CR]https://www.mobygames.com/game/game-gear/tails-adventure[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] All Chaos Emeralds[CR]Enter the following at the password screen.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] All Chaos Emeralds[CR]Enter the following at the password screen.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] All Chaos Emeralds[CR]Enter the following passwords to fully complete the coresponding levels:[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] All Chaos Emeralds[CR]Enter these codes at the password screen.</plot>

		<title_clean>TaleSpin</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]TaleSpin is a licensed platformer from Interactive Designs that was released on both the Sega Genesis and the TurboGrafx-16 based on the TaleSpin Saturday morning cartoon from Disney. The two versions have a few significant differences, but both has Baloo tasked with exploring environments in and around his hometown of Cape Suzette for valuable items in order to save his and Rebecca Cunningham's air courier service Higher for Hire.[CR]The game should not be confused with Capcom's Disney's TaleSpin for NES and Game Boy, which is a shoot 'em up that uses the same Disney property.Version Differences[CR]The 1991 TurboGrafx-16 version has Baloo chase after pieces of a stone map to find some fabulous treasure, though Higher for Hire's chief rival Shere Khan and his hired air pirate goons led by Don Karnage are also searching for the pieces. In each of the four stages, the player is also optionally tasked with collecting ten specific items to obtain a bonus to their score. Between stages, Baloo's prot&#233;g&#233; Kit Cloudkicker can collect additional bonuses while "sky surfing" behind Baloo's plane, the Seaduck.[CR]The 1992 Genesis version has Baloo competing with Shere Khan to deliver cargo, and is instead tasked with exploring each region for ten cargo crates before he can exit to the next stage. The stages have copious amounts of hidden areas, and so need thoroughly exploring. Once again, Shere Khan and Don Karnage are hoping to stop him. Baloo also attacks with his paddle ball in the Genesis version, whereas in the TurboGrafx-16 version he throws coconuts.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Terminator 2: Judgment Day was released in 1991 as an Arcade game and later ported to many home consoles, the game had the player(s) shoot their way through Skynet's arsenal of robot armies and advanced weaponry as an on-rails first-person shooter. The Arcade cabinet included a firearm controller, though home versions would not include a gun controller.[CR]The home versions were released as T2: The Arcade Game (sometimes Terminator 2: The Arcade Game). This version was released on the Amiga, SNES, Game Boy, Sega Master System and Sega Game Gear, each with varying levels of graphical fidelity to the original Arcade game but all of which largely play the same.[CR]Neither the Arcade game nor its home ports are to be confused with the side-scroller action game Terminator 2: Judgment Day, which had separate developer teams and played entirely differently.[CR]</plot>

The player assumes the role of Kyle Reese, and must repel multiple robots in the distant future before travelling back in time to protect a vulnerable Sarah Connor from a single T-800 unit.[CR]There are actually three versions of this game from three different developers, but each follows a very similar blueprint: each game features Kyle in the lead, each features side-scrolling shooter gameplay and each follows the same events as the movie.Radical Entertainment created the NES version, originally released in late 1992.Probe Software developed the 1992 Sega version, which was released on the Master System, Game Gear and Genesis. Virgin Interactive, which also published the Sega games, developed the revamped Sega CD version the following year.Mindscape, Inc. produced the 1993 SNES version of The Terminator.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level Select (PAL)[CR]This cheat only works with the PAL version.

		<plot>Tesserae is a 2-d combination of Rubic's Cube and the more advanced levels of Q-Bert. Simple yet colorful symbol graphics make for endless hours of gameplay... akin to how one can play MineSweeper or Tetris on end, this game got into your head. Gameplay consisted of "flipping" tesserae, or tiles, from squares over adjacent squares. The result would either create a complex tile, or cancel out, resulting in the deletion of a tile. The goal was to clear the board entirely. Higher levels were designated by added tile complexity, and larger board grid sizes.</plot>

		<title_clean>Tintin in Tibet</title_clean>
		<plot>Tintin au Tibet was first released on SNES and Genesis  before making its way to the Game Boy Color.  It was developed and published by Atari and follows the plot of the comic.  [CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Tintin au Tibet tells the same story as the Tintin au Tibet comic written by Herge.  It follows the adventures of young, Belgian reporter Tintin and his friends Captain Haddock and Professor Tournesol.  While Tintin and his friends are vacationing in a Swiss mountain resort, they get news about a plane crash in Tibet. Tintin starts having dreams of his friend Tchang, stranded in the Himalayas, calling for help. The next day, he receives a letter from Tchang confirming the fact that he was indeed on the doomed flight  and Tintin decides to go to the crash site to see once and for all if his friend is really dead.  Tintin and Haddock go to Kathmandu and meet with Tharkey, a sherpa, who initially refuses to bring them to the crash site. After Haddock changes his mind, Tharkey, Tintin, Haddock, and a support team decide to climb to where the plane crashed.  Their adventure doesn't go as smoothly as they thought it would.  First, Tintin's dog Milou almost drowns and then the support team abandons them because they're afraid of the Yeti.  They finally make it to where the plane crashed.  They find proof that Tchang survived the accident, but  he is nowhere to be found.  Tintin is about to give up when he finds his friend's scarf and decides to follow this new trail.  After narrowly avoiding a lethal avalanche, they find a Buddhist monastery. One of the monks has a supernatural power and is able to locate Tchang, who's been in the Yeti's cave and was taken care of by the Yeti. Tintin reunites with his friend and leaves the cave.  The game's cut scenes were actually parts of the animated series Tintin au Tibet that was released at about the same time as the game.    [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Tintin au Tibet is a platformer.  The player controls Tintin and must jump around multiple levels that range from a train station all the way to top of the Himalaya. Tintin can get hurt by a lot of things in the game's universe: butlers, bells, cows and even random people.  The gameplay tries to recreate some of the famous scenes from the comic.  In the scene where Milou almost drowns, the player must swim to go get him.  The game has the player climbing and sometimes sliding around the different levels.  The game was also known for its difficulty and the fact that the codes given the player only worked every five levels.

		<title_clean>Ultimate Soccer</title_clean>
		<plot>Ultimate Soccer is a football (European) game composed by 64 (unlicensed) international teams, each with it's own values for running, ball control and strength. There are five game modes (friendly, penalty shootout, tournament, playoff and league), but the lack of password or built-in battery means each one of them must be completed in one sitting.[CR]The gameplay can be tweaked for the players' preference by changing several key aspects of the physics engine, such as wind strength and direction, ball weight (lighter balls travel higher, faster  and farther but are more prone to be deflected by winds than heavy balls, who barely lift of the ground and are slowed down by wet grass), tightness of ball control and players speed and momentum. A five-a-side mode, where the ball is never out of play is also included. Thanks to the many options regarding the physics, the game allows a lot of flexibility in playmaking, from building up the play with small passes from the midfield to belting the ball upwards in hope of a goalmouth deflection.[CR]Graphically, the game is similar to EA's Madden NFL series, with pseudo-3D effects allowing the view to be tilted up to show more detail up front or tilted down to show more of the field. [CR]The series later continued with Striker on the same console and Striker' 96 on PC, Saturn and PlayStation.</plot>

Despite an undercover agent placed within Malone's organization, STRIKE does not know the plans Malone has for world domination. The informant is killed and again STRIKE calls in their top pilot to uncover the plot around this mysterious figure. Intelligence gathered from Hawaii reveals that Malone is actually Carlos Ortega, the Drug Lord, who had undergone plastic surgery to cover up his disfigured face and used his connections to reassert himself on the world stage. STRIKE again targets Malone's strategic investments that include oil rigs, auto factories and even Alcatraz Island. The search for Malone ends in Las Vegas as he makes his last stand inside the holding cell for superweapon, a giant laser. Malone is picked up with a bomb vest on and dropped directly into the superweapon, ridding the world of another despot and another threat averted thanks to the efforts of STRIKE.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level Passwords[CR]Enter the passwords.</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The game is set in the Victorian Era in London. While people live their lives quite normally in the daytime, there has been talk of strange murders occurring at night, when the moon is full.[CR]Dr. Ferdinand Social, a young psychologist with a knowledge of the occult has received strange warnings from the guardian spirits of his Ouija board. The spirits warn him of more horrors to come, unless the source of the evil is defeated. So Dr. Social travels to the home of fellow occult specialist Julia Arkham. Upon his arrival Dr. Social discovers that Miss Arkham has apparently been kidnapped.[CR]Returning to his home, Dr. Social finds his good friend Jonathan Harker waiting with a note sent from Miss Arkham which tells him that: "The vampire has returned. He controls powerful forces. He must be stopped!"[CR]So Dr. Social knows he is the one who must stop the killings and save Miss Arkham. Because he does not know where to start, he does what any intelligent person would do. Ask his Ouija board for assistance...[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Master of Darkness is a 2D action game much like Castlevania. Dr. Social can use a primary and a secondary weapon to defeat the monsters he encounters. The secondary weapons, however, are gone after use. These can not be "filled up" again. Another difference to Castlevania is that you can not pick up your old weapon once you have found a new one. This means that you could end up getting a weaker weapon than you had before. You start the game with three lives. After you have used all of them you can continue the game, but you have to start at the beginning of the round. At this point you can also save and quit, meaning you can start again in the last round you have reached.Weapons[CR]Primary weapons consist of:Daggers: This is the weapon Dr. Social starts with. It does 1 point of damage.Sabers: These do 2 points of damage and have a longer reach than daggers.Stakes: Also with a longer reach these weapons do 3 points of damage.Axes: Although they have a shorter reach than Sabers and Stakes the 4 point damage of axes can kill most monsters with one blow.[CR]Secondary weapons consist of:Pistol: With a supply of 16 bullets.Bomb: To throw down at hard-to-reach enemies.Boomerang: Different from your usual boomerang, these can not be catched on the way back.Projectile: This does 4 points of damage to enemies.Items[CR]Throughout the game you can also find different items. Some are only good for points, others have a impact on the game as well:[CR]Bonus Globes: These magical globes increase your score. There are four different types:Pink: 300 pointsGrey: 500 pointsRed: 1,000 pointsBlack: 1,600 points[CR]Emerald: This item destroys all enemies on the screen and is worth 100 points.[CR]Life potion: Restores 4 out of 8 life globes.[CR]Dr. Social Voodoo Doll: These masks give Dr. Social an extra life.Levels[CR]Different from what you find in Castlevania games the stages in Master of Darkness are linear. You do not have to backtrack and once you enter a new stage you can not go back to a previous stage.[CR]There are 5 levels in total:Round 1: Thames RiverRound 2: The House of Wax DollsRound 3: EpitaphRound 4: LaboratoryRound 5: In the Wake of Dracula[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Cheat Mode[CR]At the Title Screen, while the text Press Start Button is flashing, press Start then quickly hold the following three buttons: 1+2+Up.</plot>

		<title_clean>Wagyan Land</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Wagyan Land was developed by Now Production and published by Namco, and it was released only in Japan on Feburary 9, 1989. The player plays as a dinosaur named Wagyan who is on a quest to save the people of Wagyan Land from Dr. Devil. The game is primarily a side-scrolling platforming game where Wagyan must avoid enemies and make it to the end of each stage. Most stages feature a boss at the end where Wagyan must defeat them in a card minigame in order to move on to the next stage. There are also hidden warps hidden throughout the stages that can transport Wagyan to a later stage. The game spawned several sequels including two other games for the Famicom, three games for the Super Famicom, one mobile game, and one game for the Nintendo DS.[CR]Wagyan Land would eventually receive a Japan-only 2008 re-release on the Wii's Virtual Console.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Along the way there are several enemies trying to prevent Wagyan from proceeding. Wagyan has the ability to roar at enemies which can temporarily stun enemies but it cannot kill them, there are also small Wagyan powerups that can be picked up to make his roar cover a wider radius and stun enemies for longer periods of time. Once Wagyan picks up four of these powerups he will become temporarily invincible, be able to move quicker, and kill enemies on contact. Later on in the game Wagyan will receive a powerup that gives him the ability to kill enemies with his roar attack.Boss battles are really just card minigames[CR]The boss battles are unconventional; the bosses will challenge Wagyan to one of two different types of mini-games. The first type of mini-game is a word chain game, known in Japan as shiritori ("taking the end"). In this game there are 24 cards laid across the screen, the boss will pick a card with a picture on it and say what the card is. Then the player must pick a card where the first kana matches the last kana of the card the boss picked. This goes back and forth until there is no card that can match the last kana of the last card picked, the player wins if the boss can't find a card. On the other hand, the boss wins if either the player can't find a match or the player runs out of time. The second type of mini-game is a simple memory game where 24 cards are laid faced down across the screen and the player must find matching pairs. If the player finds a pair they get to go again, but if they don't the boss gets to go and the same rules apply for the boss. The player with the most pairs at the end wins. If the player loses to the boss they go back to the beginning of the stage.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Winter Olympics: Lillehammer '94 (sometimes Winter Olympic Games: Lillehammer '94, or simply Winter Olympics) is an Olympics sports simulator released for multiple home systems simultaneously in February 1994. It was produced to coincide with the 1994 Winter Olympic Games in Lillehammer, Norway.[CR]Winter Olympics features ten different events from the Winter Olympics: Slalom, Giant Slalom, Downhill Skiing, Super G Skiing, Bobsleigh, Luge, Freestyle Moguls, Ski Jump, Biathlon and Speed Skating Short Track. Each event also includes the name of the location used for the event in Lillehammer. The player can train individually with the events, play a "mini-Olympics" that covers a handful of the events or go for the "Full Olympics" with all ten events.[CR]Tiertex used different programmers for each of the console versions, producing many minor differences between every version. For instance, the Freestyle Moguls is far more demanding on the SNES version than it is on the Genesis version.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Wolfchild is a 2D shooter/platformer from British developers Core Design, which would later go on to create the Tomb Raider franchise. It features Saul Morrow, a man who is able to transform into a powerful werewolf form in order to fight the evil Chimera organization who kidnapped his scientist father Kal, from whom he received his powers. The game is a standard 2D platformer with shooting elements, and the player must collect energy before they can transform similar to Altered Beast.[CR]Wolfchild was originally released on the home computers Amiga and Atari ST, before being ported to various consoles like the Genesis, Master System, Mega-CD, SNES and Game Gear.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]When the SNES version was released Mike Weigand of Electronic Gaming Monthly awarded the score of 5 out of 10. He wrote, "...It's got great graphics, and some of the sound effects are dynamite, but Wolfchild loses big in the gameplay department. The punching and other attacks are awkward. This was a new idea, and the levels are huge, but the overall game is dull and rather unappealing".[CR]</plot>

		<plot>Just when things were going great with Tom-Tom and his girlfriend Tanya, some thug of a woodland king had to kidnap her and hide her away, and Tom-Tom doesn't have a clue where. That's why he has to explore deep dark forests, cross endless oceans, climb treacherous slopes, survive endless volcanoes, and even walk through clouds. But Tom-Tom will never be totally alone. You see, when he goes through the exotic locations, he has to come face to face with its inhabitants, like bees, spiders, snakes, coal-kids, frogs, bats, snails, coyotes, and octopuses, to name a few. The hatchet is Tom-Tom's only line of defense against these menaces.[CR]There are ten areas, each containing four rounds each, but the tenth area can't be accessed unless Tom-Tom collects all the dolls during his rescue mission. During his journey, he can break open different eggs that will reveal hatchets, skateboards, mushrooms, milk, and even guardian angels. You can ride the skateboard through each round, as long as you don't collide with an inhabitant. When you complete each round while still riding the skateboard, you'll start the next round still riding it. As you progress through each round, your vitality will start to get low, but it can be increased by getting milk, mushrooms, potato chips,or fruit that appear everywhere you go. As well as the normal eggs, there are also speckled eggs that must be avoided, otherwise the God of Death will be released, and once he follows you, you'll lose vitality much quickly. At the end of every fourth round, there is a king waiting to destroy you with his fireballs or lightning bolts.[CR]There are also warp-gates, but you don't find them, they find you. You see, warp-gates appear in rounds 1-4 of each area. If you happen to get one fruit, a special item will appear. These special items include handbags, wrist watches, a pair of shoes, a teddy bear, and a bottle of perfume. Another girl will appear and take you up to the clouds where the object is to collect as many hearts as you can without falling down or getting the item again. Once you have collected all the hearts, you can get the item to return to the surface, and more often than not, you'll get further in the round.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Unlock all weapons, full money[CR]Select continue and enter this password. You will begin on the second level as wonderboy instead of the dragon.</plot>

		<title_clean>Woody Pop</title_clean>
		<plot>Every system must have a Breakout clone, and every self-respecting developer must have one, especially in the mid-eighties, following the success of Taito's Arkanoid. Sega's answer was called Woody Pop.[CR]With a wooden paddle, which in fact is Woody the tree spirit, you bounce your ball against bricks laid out in a big house filled with toys. The toys will come out to disturb you. When you hit "mystery bricks", wind-up toy soldiers or robots come out, obstructing your ball. On some levels, a toy train will cross your path as well. Speaking of wells, the bottom of the screen is not a big black hole as in most other games of this kind  instead the whole covers only a part of the wall, so that even if you miss the ball, it might bounce back in the corners.[CR]Once a room is cleared, you can choose freely between up to three adjacent rooms to progress to, making this game less linear than usual.[CR]Like any post-Arkanoid game, there is a range of powerups released from special blocks. Most are known from other games such as the double-ball, the growing bat or the "diamond ball", which destroys all blocks in its path without ricocheting. Some invented by Sega are the fire ball, which sets blocks on fire, allowing them to destroy even neighbouring blocks, and the big ball, which hits bricks with more power, thereby destroying brick with one hit that would otherwise have required several.</plot>

Wind, snap and power are the main considerations as you dodge the bunkers, water and rough which make for more complex courses than the 8-bit versions of the original.[CR]A course editor is provided.  The courses provided include real courses like St. Andrews, a fictional designs such as The Gauntlet, which as the name suggests is designed to push your skills to the maximum.[CR]The PC version revolutionized the use of the PC speaker to reproduce voice samples via their patented "RealSound" process. Quips like "No doubt about it, he's deep in the sandtrap", "Straight onto the fairway", and "Looks like he hit the tree, Jim." are used to provide running commentary on the gameplay.</plot>

It is based on and licensed by the 1994 FIFA World Cup tournament, which was staged in nine cities across the United States of America. The 1994 World Cup mascot, a brown soccer-playing dog named Striker, features heavily in the game's menus and box art. The game was released on almost every home computer and console active in 1994. This would be the last officially produced FIFA World Cup game, as World Cup tournaments would be folded into EA Sports's annualized FIFA Soccer games.[CR]The Super Nintendo version of World Cup USA 94 features all 24 qualifying teams for the 1994 World Cup and eight additional teams that did not qualify (including England, Scotland, France, Japan and other countries that traditionally buy a lot of soccer games). Non-qualifying teams are marked with an asterisk (*). Other versions had different assortments of non-qualifying teams, including Canada, Austria, Uruguay and the former nation of Czechoslovakia.USAGermanyMexicoGreeceRussiaColombiaBrazilBoliviaSwitzerlandItalyNorwayEngland*Republic of Ireland (Eire)Scotland*Denmark*BelgiumRomaniaSwedenFrance*MoroccoCameroonArgentinaJapan*South KoreaPortugal*Netherlands (Holland)SpainWales*NigeriaSaudi ArabiaAustralia*Bulgaria[CR]</plot>

It is named for the TV show WWF Raw which regularly aired matches between WWF (now WWE) wrestlers and wrote stories around those bouts.[CR]The game uses a horizontal perspective of the ring and has multiple different modes based on events from the TV show: One-on-One, Tag Team, Bedlam, Survivor Series, Royal Rumble and Raw Endurance. Depending on the system, the player has a roster of up to thirteen WWF wrestlers to choose from.

		<title_clean>X-Men</title_clean>
		<plot>Summary[CR]Magneto gets control of the Danger Room computers and turns routine simulations into deadly games. The game consists of four playable characters ( Cyclops, Wolverine, Nightcrawler and Gambit) and five support characters ( Rogue, Storm, Iceman, Archangel and Jean Grey) as you battle against constantly intensifying danger room simulations. The heroes, with the help of Professor Xavier, try to regain control of their surroundings, eventually facing Magneto in 'real life' on his asteroid base.Levels[CR]The Savage Land (Boss Characters : Juggernaut and Zaldane)[CR]The Shi'ar Empire (Boss Character : Deathbird) Using Nightcrawler's teleport, vast sections of this level can be skipped.[CR]Light House (Boss Characters: Sabretooth, Juggernaut and Apocalypse) Using Nightcrawler's teleport, vast amounts of this level can be skipped.[CR]Post Apocalyptic World (Boss Character : Ahab)[CR]Mojo's Crunch (Boss Character : Mojo) At the end of this level, after you destroy the computer, you actually have to push the reset button on the Sega Genesis. This makes it impossible to beat if your reset button is stuck (which was the case with my Genesis) or if you are playing it on a different system.[CR]Asteroid M (Boss Character : Magneto) Using Nightcrawler's teleport, a significant portion of this level can be skipped.Bosses[CR]Juggurnaut : To defeat Juggernaut, dodge his charge and hit him in the face when he stops. If you are not on ground level he will stomp which will drop you down from any ledge you are on. My strategy was to use Nightcrawler or Wolverine and wait for him to charge a half screen away. Dodge his charge and do a jumping attack (with Nightcrawler) or a special jumping attack (with Wolverine). This should propel you behind Juggernaut, and if you were a half screen away there should be plenty of space behind him to avoid his next charge.[CR]Zaldane : Zaldane charges up an energy ball attack and jumps away when you get close. Just avoid the energy attack and hit her when she jumps or lands.[CR]Deathbird : Dodge her when she jumps or fires and hit her when she lands.[CR]Sabretooth : Hit him when he ducks. To get him to duck just stand under him and in front of him a little. He will start his downward lunging attack and when he does he is vulnerable. When using Nightcrawler, it is best to use his special ability to attack Sabertooth rather than his jumping attack given that his jumping attack can possibly propel him into a vulnerable position.[CR]Apocalypse : He can be beat very quickly simply using Nightcrawler's special ability. Just press 'A' when he comes to hit you and he will take damage. Otherwise you have to let him charge up, get close to him, jump away, and then let him charge down before you attack him.[CR]Mojo : This area is designed so you can use the platforms to jump over Mojo, but this is only necessary with Gambit. All other characters can simply jump over him and hit him in the base of the tail to cause damage. Most easily done with Nightcrawler's jumping attack or Wolverine's super jumping attack. After defeating Mojo you have to restart the console to continue to the next level. If you failed to restart the console you would lose and be sent to the opening screen.[CR]Magneto : Magneto is a difficult boss, to defeat him you must dodge his attacks and then hit him when he shoots his magnetic beam at you.Critical Reception[CR]When released, Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the Genesis version the scores of 6,7,6,8 stating, "...I wish there were more characters to choose from. The music and sounds are simply repeated noises from other Sega games... The switching of the X-men characters during the game is cool and the variety of special moves are also welcome. The game is very choppy and the control needs work".[CR]</plot>

		<plot>This X-Men is a follow-up to Arcade's Revenge where once again the player can take control of their favorite mutants Wolverine, Bishop, Gambit, Storm, Rogue, Jean Grey &amp; Cyclops, each with their own unique abilities and powers. Each character has a unique ability vital to some stages such as Storm's and Rogue's ability to fly while Cyclops and Gambit has long range capabilities and Wolverine's raw power.[CR]The story starts off with the world in peril as a deadly virus called the Legacy Virus is spreading throughout the world and is threatening to extinguish all of mankind. The X-Men learn of a cure that has been developed by a scientist by the name of the Gamesmaster and ask for his help, but in order to obtain the antidote they must first compete in a series of games scattered throughout the world by beating up various enemies and avoiding pitfalls and traps. To make matters worse, Gamesmaster has promised the X-Men's arch-rivals that if they can stop the X-Men from completing their tasks that they can have the antidote and destroy the only hope for mankind.[CR]The gameplay is a 2D side-scrolling beat-em-up with eight stages total that range from the Arctic to Egypt and the Moon with the ability for the player to choose the location they wish to explore first at the beginning of the game. Players must advance through these stages using their powers, which are in limited supply, beating up various enemies and creatures and face off against an end level boss for each stage.[CR]https://www.mobygames.com/game/game-gear/x-men-gamesmasters-legacy[CR]</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Zoop is a real-time puzzle game that was released for a number of home systems in 1995 and 1996. Players must "zoop" incoming pieces from the sides of the screen before any can reach the center, eliminating pieces of the same color and switching colors with other pieces.[CR]Most versions of the game were released in the US and Europe. The Sega Saturn is the only exception: the Saturn release was exclusive to Japan.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Zoop's main title screen.[CR]In Zoop players control a small ship that is confined to a small box in the middle of the screen, around the box enemies of various colors try to invade the box. The player's job is to use their ship to shoot like-colored enemies, if players shoot an enemy of a different color, the ship's color changes. The challenge is to swap colors with the right enemies in order to stop all of the approaching enemies. If one of the enemies get's in the ship's box, it's game over.[CR]Every second (or more often in advanced levels), a piece comes in from the side and possibly pushes other pieces forward. Two consecutive pieces will never come in from the same quadrant.[CR]</plot>
