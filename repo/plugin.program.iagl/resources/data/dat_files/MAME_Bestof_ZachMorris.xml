		<emu_comment>If you were alive and had access to coins at any time between the 1970s and the mid-1990s, chances are you'll have spent a bit of time in a video arcade, hammering buttons, frantically waggling a sweaty joystick and pumping a week's worth of pocket money into a machine.[CR]Your favorites might not be on this list, but let's be honest with ourselves here, not every cabinet was amazing. We do, however, guarantee that some of your favorites are definitely on this list.  They're all certified classics. Does anyone have a quarter that I can borrow?

		<plot>Puckman (c) 1980 Namco.[CR]Puckman is the seminal and hugely influential arcade game in which the player guides the legendary Puckman around a single-screen maze eating dots. Puckman is constantly pursued in his task by four colored ghosts. Each ghost has its own unique personality and behavioural patterns and a single touch from any of the ghosts results in Puckman losing a life. When all of Puckman's lives are lost, the game is over.[CR]Power pills are situated in each corner of the rectangular maze and eating one of these makes Puckman temporarily invincible; the four ghosts also change to dark blue in color and can now be eaten by Puckman. But watch out...a flashing blue ghost indicates that the power pill is about to wear off and the ghosts are about to transform back to their former selves again. Once Puckman eats a blue ghost, this 'skinned' ghost then becomes visible as a pair of eyes only, will return to the ghost pen in the middle of the maze, regenerate into its former self, and return to the maze to continue its pursuit of Puckman. [CR]Each maze contains 240 dots and 4 power pills, and all must be eaten to complete the level; whereupon the entire sequence begins again with an increased level of difficulty (the action increases in speed and power pills decrease in effectiveness). [CR]Twice in every level, a bonus fruit or prize item will temporarily appear in the middle of the maze below the ghost pen. Puckman can eat these bonus items to receive extra points. Also, there is an escape tunnel on each side of the maze that Puckman can use to escape any ghosts that are currently closing in on him. The ghosts can also use the tunnel, but take longer to pass through it than Puckman, making escape a little easier. [CR]Between certain rounds, funny intermissions will be played featuring Puckman and the ghosts in funny situations. Three intermissions are present: [CR]1) The red ghost chases Puckman across the screen and off the side. Then he re-appears running in the opposite direction, having turned blue, followed by a giant Puckman! This intermission is played after Round 2. [CR]2) The red ghost is again chasing Puckman, but this time he rips his red sheet on a nail on the ground, and we can see his pink body under the sheet! This intermission is played after Round 5. [CR]3) The red ghost chases Puckman across the screen once more, this time with his sheet sewn. They disappear at the left side and then the ghost reappears coming back the opposite direction. This time he is bare and drags his sheet behind him. This intermission is played after Rounds 9, 13 and 17. [CR]No intermission is present between rounds after the 18th one.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]The original Namco Puckman Upright model came in a white cabinet that may look familiar to most gamers. This cabinet is the same 'swoopy' design used for Pac-Man and Galaxian. The only actual design difference was the coin door. The Japanese version had a tall coin door with a single coin mech, while the U.S. version, Pac-Man, had a fat coin door with two coin mechs installed. However, the graphics on the Japanese machine were completely different from those of the U.S. machine. The marquee had the 'Puckman' logo off to the right-hand side at an angle, and showed a scene with half a dozen cartoon Puckmen eating power pellets, with a few ghosts lingering off to the side. The monitor bezel was largely red and was of a circular design and had many Puckmen lounging around the perimeter of the circle. The control panel continued the reddish graphics and had instructions in Japanese, along with a yellow ball-top 4-Way joystick and Start buttons for each player. The sideart was a large circular sticker that advertised the game's name, and had many cartoon Puckmen in action around the edges of the circle, with the word Namco displayed prominently at the bottom. The cabinet was finished off with yellow t-molding on the edges. [CR]Main CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 3.072 Mhz) [CR]Sound Chips : Namco 3-channel WSG [CR]Players : 2 [CR]Control : 4-way joystick[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]The game was first introduced to the Japanese arcade market in May 1980 and caught the hearts and imaginations of the public like no other game before it, and few since. It is still regarded as the hallmark of the 'golden age' of video games and an icon of 1980's popular culture. [CR]The game was originally known in Japan as Puckman, but due to the West's predilection with changing words to vulgarities by scratching part of the word off (in this case, changing the word 'Puck' to something rather less socially acceptable by scratching off part of the letter 'P'), the name was changed to "Pac-Man" for its release to the American arcade market in October 1980. The name 'Pac-Man' comes from the Japanese slang term 'paku-paku', which describes the motion of the mouth opening and closing during eating and translates to English as 'to eat'. [CR]Toru Iwatani, author and designer of Puckman: "Puckman's character is difficult to explain even to the Japanese -- he is an innocent character. He hasn't been educated to discern between good and evil. He acts more like a small child than a grown-up person. Think of him as a child learning in the course of his daily activities. If someone tells him guns are evil, he would be the type to rush out and eat guns. But he would most probably eat any gun, even the pistols of policemen who need them." [CR]Puckman was, quite literally, conceived at lunchtime. Iwatani, then in his mid 20s, was very hungry and ordered himself a pizza for lunch. He took one slice, and, looking at the rest of the pizza, Puckman was born. However, in later years, Iwatini has suggested the shape was based on the Japanese character 'kuchi', meaning mouth. He rounded off this shape, and created the classic shape. The game took 1 1/2 years to complete and had five people on its team. Puckman is the greatest selling arcade game of all time and is arguably also the world's most recognized video-game character of all time. It had its own cartoon, lunch box, board game, stickers and hundreds of other products. This was largely due to Puckman being the first truly distinctive video-game 'character', and it changed the face of video games forever. Puckman was the first video game to be as equally popular to women as it was with men. [CR]* A place in video game history: "Pac-Man is the most universally known arcade game," said Chris Lindsey, director of the National Video Game and Coin-Op Museum in St. Louis. "Everybody knows about Pac-Man. And, I've noticed, almost everybody can play Pac-Man pretty well. Pac-Man makes just about the best use of the joystick one can imagine. It's so intuitive that it puts other games to shame in terms of how easy it is for a person to walk up, stick a quarter in the machine, and start doing something meaningful. At the time, Pac-Man introduced a completely unique style of game play and was also highly identifiable in terms of its music. With Pac-Man, everything was there. The video game industry needs another game that captures the public's heart like Pac-Man, and so far, no one has been able to come up with it." [CR]* The great 25-cent escape: "People expect to see Pac-Man when they come into the museum, and without fail, when they see it, they want to play it," Lindsey said. "People remember spending hours and hours at Pac-Man. They like to see how good they are now when they play it. And I would say that, perhaps more than any other game, the same playing skills still apply. Perhaps it's because of the intuitive game play. You don't have to memorize the behavior of a wide array of enemies as you do with some other games. You just have to remember that when the ghosts turn blue, you only have seconds, until they start seriously blinking, to go and get them. And Pac-Man is a little looser in its style of game play - more open. For instance, you can kill time in the lower left hand corner until you see an opening between the ghosts, and you can strategize a bit more: You can play with the tunnels, you can play with the position of the ghosts in relation to the energizers. Even people who haven't played in years remember those strategies."[CR]After all these years, the challenge of Pac-Man still remains. [CR]"You can also get into some really fun jams, when you've got a ghost on your tail and you have to make a decision about whether you're going to go left, or right, or straight at the next junction, which is in .03 seconds," Lindsey said. "It gets to be pretty tense, especially when those ghosts start moving really fast and the energizers aren't lasting as long. Pac-Man can be a real heart-thumping game." [CR]After the 255th level, Puckman/Pac-Man presents the player with the infamous 'split-screen' level, where the left-half of the screen is normal, but the right-half of the screen is garbled with a mess of letters, numbers, symbols and other graphics. This level cannot be completed because there are not enough dots on screen to be eaten! This is the result of a bug in the routine drawing the fruits at the bottom of the screen, according to the round number. Indeed, the code works as follows: [CR]1) it increases the last round number by one; [CR]2) it checks if the result is smaller than 8 (in this case, you still would not have enough fruits to fill the line and some blank space must be drawn); [CR]3) it checks if the result is larger than 19 (in this case, it has only to draw keys); [CR]4) finally, it fills the bottom bar with the correct fruits. [CR]In particular, if the round number is smaller than 8, the game draws as many fruits as the previous round number. This produces an undesirable effect right after the 255th level. [CR]Indeed, 256 = 255+1 becomes 00 for the CPU (which expects to use the last 2 hexadecimal digits only, and 256 = 100 in hex)! [CR]Therefore, the game thinks to be in one of the first 7 levels (because 0 is smaller than 7), but it tries to draw 255 fruits (because the last round number was 255). Of course, there is no space for that many fruits to be displayed and the game starts to draw garbage on the main screen. [CR]Fixing the original code (either through a cheat in emulation, or hacking the roms on the PCB) would results in a 256th level identical to the first one (cherries will appear) but harder, since ghosts will behave as they do in levels beyond the 19th. [CR]The alien spaceship "Galaxian" makes an appearance as the prize in the 9th and 10th boards. [CR]Note : Excluding bootlegs, there are 23 different name/nickname combinations for the ghosts in Puckman/Pac-Man (29 including 'Sue' from "Ms. Pac-Man", 'Tim' from "Jr. Pac-Man", 'Common' and 'Grey Common' from the Japanese version of "Pac-Mania", and 'Funky' and 'Spunky' from the American version of "Pac-Mania"). [CR]'Galaxian' boards will run in Pac-Man machines, but the sound pinout is different, so the pinout at the connector would have to be modified. To fire, one would have to press UP on the joystick. [CR]Billy Mitchell, Rick Fothergill, Chris Ayra, Tim Balderramos and Donald Hayes all hold the official record for this game on 'Regular (TGTS)' settings with a perfect score of 3,333,360 points on July 3, 1999, July 31, 1999, February 16, 2000, December 4, 2004 and July 21, 2005, respectively. [CR]Chris Ayra holds the official record for the fastest time to get a perfect game on 'Regular' settings with 3:42:05 on April 2, 2002. [CR]Ron Corcoran holds the official record for this game on 'Speedup' settings with 1,321,020 points on May 13, 2001.[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]The attract mode's title sequence introduces the ghosts with name/nickname combinations displayed on the upper half of the screen. [CR]The default name/nickname combinations for the ghosts in the original Japanese version are : [CR]Oikake - "Akabei" (translation: Chaser - "Red Guy") (red ghost)[CR]Machibuse - "Pinky" (translation: Ambusher - "Pink Guy") (pink ghost)  [CR]Kimagure - "Aosuke" (translation: Fickle - "Blue Guy") (cyan ghost) [CR]Otoboke - "Guzuta" (translation: Stupid - "Slow Guy") (orange ghost)  [CR]The Japanese version also has a DIP switch for alternate name/nickname combinations for the ghosts. These alternate names are : [CR]Urchin - "Macky" (red ghost) [CR]Romp - "Micky" (pink ghost) [CR]Stylist - "Mucky" (cyan ghost) [CR]Crybaby - "Mocky" (orange ghost) [CR]The name/nickname combinations for the ghosts in the North American version are : [CR]Shadow - "Blinky" (red ghost)[CR]Speedy - "Pinky" (pink ghost)[CR]Bashful - "Inky" (cyan ghost)[CR]Pokey - "Clyde" (orange ghost)[CR]Unlike the Japanese version, the American version has no DIP switch for alternate ghost names.[CR]ADDITIONAL NOTES: [CR]In Japan Set 3: [CR]* At the top of the title screen, instead of 'Nickname', it says 'Ghost'. [CR]* The 'Press Start' screen displays 1981 as the year of release, instead of 1980.[CR][B]Scoring[/B][CR]Dot : 10 points. [CR]Power pill (energizer) : 50 points. [CR]Ghosts : 200, 400, 800, 1,600 points. [CR]Cherry : 100 points. [CR]Strawberry : 300 points. [CR]Peach : 500 points. [CR]Apple : 700 points. [CR]Pineapple : 1,000 points. [CR]Galaxian : 2,000 points. [CR]Bell : 3,000 points. [CR]Key : 5,000 points.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* The number of lives Puckman starts with depends on the 'Lives' dip switch setting (1, 2, 3, or 5; the default is 3).[CR]* An extra life is awarded based on the 'Extra Lives' dip switch setting (10,000, 15,000, 20,000, or None; the default is 10,000). [CR]* Fruits appear twice on each board. The first fruit appears after Puckman has eaten 70 dots; the second fruit appears once there are only 70 dots remaining in the maze. [CR]* At the beginning of a round, the ghosts won't immediately pursue Puckman. Use this time the best as you can. [CR]* Puckman can turn corners faster than the ghosts can, so turning many corners can help you escape ghosts. [CR]* The tunnel allows Pac-Man and the ghosts to instantly travel from one side of the maze to the other. While traveling through the tunnel, Puckman moves at normal speed, but the ghosts' speed is reduced in half. This provides Puckman with a good opportunity to put some distance between him and the ghosts, but be careful not to get trapped by another ghost entering the opposite side. [CR]* Stall Puckman from entering the tunnel and then, just before the ghosts reach him, send him through the tunnel. By attracting the ghosts to one side of the screen, you reduce Puckman's chances of meeting them when he emerges on the other side of the screen.[CR]* If you hold the joystick in a direction that is blocked by a wall, Puckman will turn in that direction as soon as he reaches a passage leading in that direction. Remember this to turn corners as fast as you can. [CR]* Remember that eating dots will slow Puckman down a little bit: avoid parts of the maze in which you've not been yet if you are trying to escape ghosts! [CR]* Try not to eat power pills until the ghosts are near. The longer Puckman waits, the closer the ghosts get, and the easier it is for Puckman to eat them once they have turned blue. [CR]* Mind that, as the levels increases, the ghost speed increases as well! [CR]* In later rounds, you're not going to be able to eat ghosts after eating a power pill, because the vulnerability time decreases to zero. This is when you need to learn how to avoid the ghosts understanding their movement and their moving patterns! [CR]* Right above the ghost pen, there are two paths leading upward to the upper part of the maze. The ghosts never travel upward through these holes while they're in their normal forms; they only do while they're blue after Puckman has eaten a power pill. Indeed, they only exit the area around the ghost pen from the sides or the bottom. These are not completely safe corners, since ghosts can travel downward through them, anyway they often represents a safe passage to flee from ghosts pursuing you around the ghost pen. [CR]* Ghosts' Movements : First of all, remember that ghosts are not always following you! Their movements follow two distinct phases: one in which they avoid Puckman and one in which they hunt him down. In the former phase, each ghost patrols his personal corner of the maze. In the latter one, they will try to find Puckman, following their personal 'behavior': [CR]1) The red ghost tends to patrol the top-right corner of the maze and he follows Puckman always trying to minimize their respective distance. [CR]2) The pink ghost tends to patrol the top-left corner of the maze and he follows Puckman trying to reach a position slightly in front of Puckman, in the direction he's moving. [CR]3) The cyan ghost tends to patrol the bottom-right corner of the maze and he has the most complicated AI since he moves towards a point determined by both Puckman's position and the red ghost's position. [CR]4) The orange ghost tends to patrol the bottom-left corner of the maze and he only tries to be close to Puckman, without hunting him directly. [CR]Ghosts alternate these two different behaviors (hiding and hunting) a few times in each round, then they start to pursue Puckman restlessly until all the dots are eaten, or they manage to catch him. [CR]Additionally, as soon as a certain number of dots has been cleared from the maze (this number decreases as the levels pass), the red ghost's speed will increase and he won't stop to search for Puckman anymore.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

		<plot>Donkey Kong (c) 1981 Nintendo of America, Incorporated.[CR]Export version for North America. For more information about the game itself, please see the original Japanese upright version entry.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR][Blue Upright model] [CR]The blue uprights (which are the most common), are a very rectangular affair, with quite a lot of artwork. They have orange-ish sticker style side-art (with Mario and Kong on them), with control panel, marquee, and monitor bezel graphics to match. This game does not use a standard arcade monitor. It requires a 'Nintendo Compatible' monitor (a normal monitor will display the picture like that of a photographic negative). This simple little monitor change basically launched the entire Nintendo Vs. Unisystem later on. Because only Donkey Kong series games and Vs. titles would work on these monitors (forcing operators to buy conversion kits for those games instead of a competitors game). [CR][Red Upright model] [CR]The red upright versions are actually "Radar Scope" cabinets that have been factory-converted to Donkey Kong. These are fairly rare and feature slightly different gameplay.[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Donkey Kong was released in July 1981 in the USA.[CR]Donkey Kong was to be Nintendo's first big breakthrough into the western - and particularly American - arcade scene. Before Donkey Kong, Nintendo was having difficulty establishing itself in these markets. After the game's massive success Nintendo quickly established their headquarters of Nintendo of America to ensure that the game was being distributed properly. [CR]Mario was named after Mario Segale, the landlord of Nintendo of America's first warehouse location in Seattle (though it was debated whether this occurred before or well after the game was released). Mario was originally called 'Jumpman'; only the arcade version of Donkey Kong has ever called the hero Jumpman; most home coversions, particularly the NES version, game him the Mario name.[CR]Accounts differ as to how Nintendo of America felt about the game before its release. Many sources claim that they all felt sure it would be an absolute disaster while others say they were more optimistic.[CR]Although Mario is a plumber in later games, his career in Donkey Kong is that of a carpenter. Mario's appearance (and consequently his career) was dictated by the primitive graphics hardware of the time - the only way to have his arms appear 'separate' to his torso was to have them as a different color - hence he wears 'dungarees'. The mustache is present merely to indicate where Mario's mouth is, again due to the low graphics resolution imposed by hardware limitations. Mario wears a hat so his head is distinguishable from the game's black backgrounds. [CR]About 60,000 units were sold in the US. Oddly, despite it being one of the ten best selling games of the golden age of video games, it never reached #1 on Replay's popularity charts. Instead, it was stuck at #2 behind mega hits "Pac-Man" and "Ms. Pac-Man" - the two best selling games ever. [CR]Donkey Kong inspired a catchy hit song by Buckner and Garcia called 'Do The Donkey Kong' released on the 'Pac-Man Fever' album. [CR]A Donkey Kong unit appears in the 1983 movie 'WarGames', the 1984 movie 'Gremlins', the 1985 movie 'The Heavenly Kid', and the sitcom 'Two and a Half Men' (Season 5, Episode 2 - People Who Love Peepholes). [CR]MB (Milton Bradley) released a board game based on this video game (same name) in 1982. Save the girl and avoid the barrels and fireballs as in the video game. The gameboard is laid out like the video game's Ramp Stage. 'Can You Battle Donkey Kong and Save the Fair Maiden?'. [CR]Donkey Kong also spawned a cartoon series of the same name : Ruby-Spears Productions. Produced by Joe Ruby and Ken Spears. Originally aired September 17, 1983 as part of 'Saturday Supercade' on CBS. Mario was voiced by veteran voice actor Peter Cullen, while Donkey Kong's voice was provided by the late actor/comedian Soupy Sales (1926-2009). [CR]Michael Jackson used to own this game (Blue Upright model). It was sold at the official Michael Jackson Auction on April 24, 2009.[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]The original Japanese version had all four stages displayed in their original, logical order 1-2-3-4.[CR]For this US version, they changed it to match the 'How High Can You Try/Get?' theme, with the stage order as follows : [CR]L-01 : 1-4 [CR]L-02 : 1-3-4 [CR]L-03 : 1-2-3-4 (as in all levels of the Japanese version) [CR]L-04 : 1-2-1-3-4 [CR]L-05 : 1-2-1-3-1-4 [CR]L-06 through L-21 all remain the same as L-05 [CR]L-22 : 1 (Kill screen).[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

For more information about the game itself, please see the original Taito upright model entry; "Space Invaders".[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Game ID : 739[CR][Upright model][CR]Buttons : 3 (LEFT, RIGHT, FIRE)[CR](The US upright model had no joystick)[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Space Invaders by Midway was released in October 1978 in the USA.[CR]The Space Invaders phenomenon stunned many conservative adults of the time who were convinced that video-games soured the minds of their youngsters. Residents of Mesquite, Texas, pushed the issue all the way to the Supreme Court in their efforts to ban the illicit machines from their Bible-belt community. A number of reported incidents of juvenile crime began to surface shortly after the game's release, adding to its 'controversy'. A girl was caught stealing $5,000 from her parents and gangs of youths were reported to have robbed grocery stores just so they would have money to play the game.[CR]Of the reported 350,000 units produced world wide, about 65,000 units were produced in the U.S. alone.[CR]Technology journalist Jason Whittaker credited the game's success to ending the video game crash of 1977, which had earlier been caused by Pong clones flooding the market, and beginning the golden age of video arcade games. According to The Observer, the home console versions were popular and encouraged users to learn programming; many who later became industry leaders.[CR]Space Invaders inspired a catchy hit song by 'Uncle Vic' called 'Space Invaders' released over the spring to summer-time period of 1980. The Pretenders also released an instrumental song called 'Space Invaders' on their debut album in 1980.[CR]A Space Invaders unit appears in the 1980 movie 'Midnight Madness', in the 1982 movie 'Jekyll &amp; Hyde... Together Again', in the 1982 movie 'Fast Times at Ridgemont High', in the 1983 movie 'Joysticks', in the 1984 movie 'The Iceman', in the 1991 movie 'Terminator 2 - Judgment Day', and in the 1998 sitcom 'That 70's Show'; Season 4, Episode 8 (Donna's Story).[CR]An upright unit of the Midway release of Space Invaders appears in the ZZ Top music video, 'Legs'.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

		<plot>Defender (c) 1980 Williams.[CR]Defender is a legendary sideways-scrolling shoot-em-up - the very first of its genre - in which the aim is to pilot a laser-firing spaceship and protect humanoids stranded on the planet's surface from swarms of alien abductors.[CR]A long-range scanner at the top of the screen shows the positions of both the humanoids and the attacking aliens. The ideal strategy is to shoot down the alien ships before they reach the humanoids. If a humanoid is captured, the alien abductor can still be destroyed, but the player must then catch the falling humanoid and return it to the safety of the planet's surface before it falls to its death.[CR]If an alien is allowed to carry its victim to the very top of the screen, the humanoid will mutate, becoming a permanent part of the alien that captured it. This new and deadly mutation will then immediately join in the alien attack.[CR]The challenge becomes more intense as action progresses. Fighter ships and their mines will soon join the abductors. There are also mother ships that must be destroyed; these are particularly difficult as a direct hit smashes the mother ship into a swarming mass of mini-ships that must also be wiped out. Throughout the entire mission, the player must act quickly or face possible destruction by the cosmic baiter, a fast and dangerous enemy.[CR]Players have two escape options to use as a last resort. The first is the 'smart bomb', which destroys all on-screen enemies. The second option is 'hyperspace', which randomly teleports the player's ship to another part of the level. This is highly risky as it may place the player's ship in a position more dangerous than the one it left.[CR]If all humanoids are successfully abducted, the planet will explode in a blinding flash and the waves remaining until the next planet is reached take place in outer space, and consist solely of destroying enemy waves.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Board Number : D75 (top), D71F (A) [CR]Prom Stickers : DF [CR]Main CPU : Motorola M6809 (@ 1 Mhz) [CR]Sound CPU : M6808 (@ 894.75 Khz) [CR]Sound Chips : DAC [CR]Players : 2 [CR]Control : 2-way joystick (vertical) [CR]Buttons : 5 [CR]= &gt; THRUST, FIRE, REVERSE, SMART BOMB, HYPERSPACE[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]According to Defender development lead Eugene Jarvis: The game was shown at AMOA Chicago October 31, 1980 and released a week or two later in November 1980.[CR]Along with Namco's seminal "Pac-Man", Defender shares the title of 'Highest Grossing Video Game of All Time' and to date has earned more than one billion dollars. It's interesting to note that when the now-legendary shoot-em-up was first shown at a 1981 Chicago arcade machine trade show, it was deemed to be a flop due to its high level of difficulty. Arcade industry insiders confidently predicted that both Defender and "Pac-Man" would be commercial flops and that Namco's "Rally-X" would be the next major arcade success. [CR]Defender's attract mode for the game was programmed in just five hours. [CR]Defender was noted for both its superb sound and visual effects and, moreover, for its extremely demanding gameplay. This didn't, however, stop players from accumulating millions of points when playing the game. Just minutes after the opening of the AMOA - an arcade industry trade show - Eugene Jarvis and his team - Defender's creators - were burning new ROMs for the game's display due to the fact they plugged the first burn into the board BACKWARDS and fried them. Due to the intimidating controls, hardly anyone at the show played the game and there were even rumours circulating suggesting that both "Pac-Man" and Defender would flop and that Namco's "Rally-X" would be the next big hit. Not only did Defender have the highest number of controls (five buttons, in addition to a two-way joystick) but it was also the first video game to feature an artificial 'world', in that game events occurred OUTSIDE the on-screen viewing area presented to the player. [CR]Chris Hoffman holds the official record for this game on 'Marathon' settings with 79,976,975 points on January 1, 1984. [CR]Bill Jones holds the official record for this game on 'Tournament' settings with 543,950 points on August 15, 2008. [CR]Some bootlegs of this game are known as "Star Trek 1981", "Defence Command", "Defense Command", "Zero" (Jeutel), and "Tornado" (Jeutel). [CR]Defender inspired a catchy hit song by Buckner and Garcia called 'Defender' released on the 'Pac-Man Fever' album. [CR]A Defender unit appears in the 1983 movie 'Terms of Endearment', in the 1983 movie 'Joysticks' and in the 1983 movie 'Koyaanisqatsi - Life out of Balance'. [CR]The official video of the 1982 pop song "Herbergsvater", by Joachim Witt, begins by featuring a Defender unit and contains long scenes of Defender gameplay.[CR]A mini Defender unit appears in the 1983 music video 'Almost Over You' by Sheena Easton. [CR]MB (Milton Bradley) released a board game based on this video game (same name) in 1983: win the most points by using your Defender ships to protect Humanoids from waves of aliens. A set of chance cards will bring the different aliens (Bombers, Landers and Humanoids) into play. Movement is determined with a spinner. Players can move their defenders and aliens.[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]Defender ROM sets were distinguished by early and later editions. The early edition supported only upright cabinets. In 1981 Williams released a cocktail cabinet version which necessitated extra code to flip the video display and to support a second set of game controls. The editions had some minor differences in the game's attract mode : The early edition gave an erroneous point value of '100' for alien landers; this was corrected to '150' in the later edition. Also, the high score value for player PGD was '14185' in the early edition and '14285' in the later edition. [CR]Early edition ROM sets : [CR]* Defender (White Label) [CR]* Defender (Green Label) [CR]* Defender (Blue Label) [CR]Later edition ROM sets : [CR]* Defender (Red Label)[CR][B]Scoring[/B][CR]Lander : 150 points.[CR]Mutant : 150 points.[CR]Baiter : 200 points.[CR]Bomber : 250 points.[CR]Pod : 1,000 points.[CR]Swarmer : 150 points.[CR]Completely destroying a pod with a smart bomb : 1,150, 1,300, 1,450, 1,600, 1,750, 1,900, or 2,050 points. [CR]* The chances that a bombed pod will score 1,150, 1,300, or 1,450 points are 1/256 each.[CR]Getting hit by an enemy bullet : 25 points.[CR]Saving a humanoid from a Lander : 500 points.[CR]Depositing a humanoid into the ground : 500 points.[CR]Humanoid landing into the ground safely on his own : 250 points.[CR]Bonus at the end of each wave : [CR]Wave 1 : Humanoids Left X 100.[CR]Wave 2 : Humanoids Left X 200.[CR]Wave 3 : Humanoids Left X 300.[CR]Wave 4 : Humanoids Left X 400.[CR]Wave 5 and above : Humanoids Left X 500.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* The enemies that initially appear in each wave are : [CR]Wave 1 : 15 Landers [CR]Wave 2 : 20 Landers, 3 Bombers, and 1 Pod [CR]Wave 3 : 20 Landers, 4 Bombers, and 3 Pods [CR]Waves 4 and up : 20 Landers, 5 Bombers, and 4 Pods [CR]* Avoid using hyperspace unless you are about to die. Fighting off attacks, regardless of the number of enemies, will make you a better Defender player. [CR]* Baiters can usually be overcome by hitting the reverse button twice quickly. They will fly past you and be in range for your fire power. Do NOT try to outrun them as baiters are faster than your ship. [CR]* Swarmers are easy to defeat. You can hit reverse as soon as they fly past you and fly behind them. They cannot shoot backwards so you can blast away at will. [CR]* Shooting a Pod will release between 1 and 7 Swarmers. The chances that it will try to release 1, 2, or 3 Swarmers is 1/256 for each. Also, the maximum number of Swarmers allowed in the game is 20. So, for example, if there are 18 Swarmers in the game and a Pod is hit, it can only release a maximum of 2 Swarmers. [CR]* At higher levels, you will need to play God and even sacrifice some Humanoids (by killing them yourself) to preserve the rest of the planet's population. The planet is too large for you protect and you are sparing the Humanoids from a fate worst than death (mutation). Do not worry, these Humanoids reproduce quickly and overpopulation has always been a constant problem. The planet will be fully populated at the start of every fifth attack wave (configurable). [CR]* The International Date Line : there are reverse lines for Swarmers and Mutants (AKA the 'International Date Line'). If this line is between you and the type of enemy in question, they will travel the opposite direction around the planet to get you (i.e. they won't cross this line to get to you). If a Mutant, say, is following you and you cross the Mutant reverse line (to the left of the big mountain) it will suddenly reverse direction and go around the other way. The same is true for the Swarmer reverse line (located approximately where your ship starts each wave). This doesn't affect Swarmers that you are following behind. If you're on one side of the line and a Pod is on the other and you shoot it open, the Swarmers will fly away from you and you can get in behind them immediately. The best use of these lines is where there are lots of Swarmers and/or Mutants that you don't want to hassle with. You stay near the line and go back and forth over it to keep the enemy on the other side of the planet. This is especially useful in space and waves that get really hairy. [CR]* Freeze : you can freeze a Defender machine by picking up all ten Humanoids (on any wave, but Wave 1 is your greatest chance at success), stopping all forward motion of your ship, quieting the screen down (i.e. having no enemies moving around on it) and setting all the Humanoids straight down quickly. This seems to work better were the terrain is very close to the bottom of the screen. Everything will freeze, but you can still move your ship up and down. Thrusting will break the spell, so to speak. If you do pick a spot with shallow terrain, some Humanoids will go thru the bottom of the screen and appear suspended in mid-air near the top. This trick is good to use during marathon games when you've reached Wave 256 and need a breather. [CR]* Some top players begin each round by shooting all the Humanoids except for one, which they pick up. The planet is too large for you protect and you are sparing the Humanoids from mutation, a fate worse than death. This keeps Mutants from developing, but it also means that the planet explodes if you lose your last Humanoid. The planet is fully repopulated at the start of every fifth attack wave (configurable). This can be considered an advanced trick. [CR]* Due to a bug in the algorithm that computes extra lives, every scoring activity from 990,000 to 999,975 will earn one extra ship and one extra Smart Bomb. If the player suicides on something or gets shot, one ship is lost, but one ship and one smart bomb are awarded; the net effect on the number of ships is zero. Dying on hyperspace re-entry awards nothing, because this awards no points. For winning N ships from 990,000 to 999,975, the player will have to achieve N x 10000 points after passing 1,000,000 before the game's accounting balances, and ships are awarded properly at 10,000 point intervals again. For example, if a player earns 45 extra lives during this interval, he will have to score another 450,000 points before being awarded another extra life. The player gets to keep surplus ships and bombs and can have super long turns where he may bomb two to three times per wave to get out of dangerous situations. [CR]* The trick is this: If the player wins 100+ ships between 990,000 and 1,000,000, this causes the game to start awarding extra lives right away again after turning the score over to zero. If the player wins 100 ships, the machine will have to wait 1,000,000 points to begin awarding ships again. However, since 1,000,000 is equivalent to zero, it awards them immediately at 1,010,000. [CR]* It's possible on a real Defender machine to make the screen color inverted so that all the black space is white while you are playing. It will reset itself when you die and maybe when you use hyperspace. Smart bomb flashes are cool when it's reversed. The trick was to drop a credit in right when you die and the screen flashes white. Somehow the program gets distracted (non-masked interrupt on coin drop?) and the screen stays white. [CR]* Defender attack waves 'roll over' at Wave 100, which is displayed, after being completed, as Wave 0. The game keeps track of the actual number of waves, even though they are not shown properly. For example, the next wave will be counted as Wave 101, even though it shows being completed as Wave 1. The game will 'roll over' again at Wave 200, which is displayed, after being completed, as Wave 0 as well. [CR]The next 'roll over' occurs at Wave 256. Upon completion of Wave 255, the next wave is a 'blank' wave, in which no enemies appear, and the wave immediately ends after the player&#8217;s ship appears on screen. This level is counted and displayed as Wave 0, and the player is awarded a bonus of humanoids left X 0 points (the bonus for this wave is always 0 points). The next is Wave 1, and the game now plays just as if the player had started a new game, except the player gets to keep his score and all of his bonus ships and smart bombs.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

		<plot>Frogger (c) 1981 Konami Industry Company, Limited.[CR]Frogger is a 1- or 2-player game in which players move their frog from the bottom to the top of the screen. This is achieved by overcoming a number of hazards without getting run over or drowned. [CR]The first half of the screen is a bi-directional flow of traffic including busses, cars and racecars. Players must avoid these vehicles. Frogs can move safely with the flow of traffic to make their way to the second half of the screen, which consists of a river with fast moving logs and sinkable turtles. Frogs must hop on the backs of the logs and the turtles to get to the home base at the top of the screen. At random times throughout the game play, a lady frog will appear on a log. Bonus points are scored if the frog successfully hops on the back of the lady frog and escorts her safely home. A fly will also appear randomly in a home base. Bonus points can be scored if the frog hops in the home base when the fly is present. Sinking turtles also swiftly move across the river with the logs. If a frog is unsuccessful in hopping on a turtle's back, the frog will sink and drown. Crocodiles, snakes, and otters also roam the moving river waiting to eat frogs on their way up to the home base. Players can hop on their back (except the snake, whose touch is deadly), but they must avoid their open mouths. The frog must be lined up perfectly to enter one of the 5 home bases. Players must maneuver the frogs to their home base within the allotted time (60 beats on the timer). [CR]The frog can move vertically or horizontally by maneuvering the joystick. Players must maneuver the frog swiftly and precisely without getting run over, drowned, or eaten by the creatures that roam the flowing river. Avoiding traffic, deadly snakes, otters, crocodiles, and the treacherous diving turtles make game action stimulating in Frogger.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Game ID : GX392[CR]Main CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 3.072 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 1.78975 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : General Instrument AY8910 (@ 1.78975 Mhz)[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 4-Way Joystick[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Frogger was released by Konami in June 1981 in Japan; it became a runaway hit. [CR]1981 was a big year in video games. A lot of companies were putting some pretty popular games on the market and it created a very competitive atmosphere as to what company was putting out the most popular ones. In addition, 1981 continued on the trend of the 'cute' type games such as "Ms. Pac-Man", "Qix", and a host of Pac-Man clones. Konami was already becoming a force to be reckoned with in the video gaming world. With such hits as "Space War", "Scramble", and "Super Cobra", Konami was making its mark. [CR]The sound that can be heard when a coin is inserted into the machine was sampled by producer Richard X for the Sugababes' song, 'Freak Like Me' (and is the very first sound on the track). [CR]Frogger has numerous bugs, although many of these are not immediately apparent to the average player : [CR]1. Sections of the music will occasionally cut out, although the main melody will continue to play. [CR]2. On occasion, Frogger displays a somewhat haphazard approach to collision detection. One side effect of this is that the player can sometimes make a perfectly legal and safe jump and still lose a life. Another side effect of this is that the player can jump up onto the first row of turtles, and then immediately jump back. This will place the player 'off the grid', and it is now possible to jump right off the side of the screen, leading to a loss of life. [CR]3. There are several other odd jumps that can be made as well. Firstly, the player can 'hang off' the left side of a turtle, but attempting to do the same on the right side results in death. If the player jumps onto a home base with an alligator (and the 'gator vanishes after you jump, but before the player lands), Frogger will be killed, but he will ALSO make it home. Finally, left and right jumps on the top row of logs are sometimes much slower than usual - this is more likely to occur after previously eating a fly. [CR]4. Another in-game bug is that the lady frog will sometimes be invisible, but will flash red when the player jumps onto the spot where she is. [CR]Mark Robichek holds the official record for this game with 442330 points. [CR]A Frogger unit appears in the 1999 movie 'Magnolia' and the sitcom 'Two and a Half Men'; Season 5, Episode 2 (People Who Love Peepholes). [CR]Frogger inspired a catchy hit song by Buckner and Garcia called 'Froggy's Lament' released on the 'Pac-Man Fever' album. [CR]The TV show, Seinfeld, has an episode named 'The Frogger'. George and Jerry are in Mario's Pizza which is closing down, and they find a Frogger game still there. They realize that the high score of 860630 points has George's initials GLC [George Louis Costanza]. They reminisce about the night it happened : "I was unstoppable!... Just the right amount of grease on the joystick". George decides to buy the Frogger machine to immortalize his high score, but Jerry informs him that unplugging the game will erase all of the scores. Later, George tries in vain to call an electrician to help : "I need a guy that can rig a Frogger machine so that I can move it without losing power, 'cause I have the high score. H-hello?". Kramer suggests an electrician who can help. George says, "Kramer, listen to me. I'm never gonna have a child. If I lose this Frogger high score, that's it for me". George assembles a team and hatches a plan to salvage the game. But when he arrives, he finds the team playing the game, which has only three minutes of battery life left. They can't get it back in the closed pizzeria, but there is an open pharmacy across the street where it could be plugged in. George decides to push the machine across the highway, and an overhead shot of this feat looks much like the Frogger game itself, and the music from the game is played. At the end, George is unable to push the game onto the sidewalk and it gets destroyed by an oncoming truck. [CR]MB (Milton Bradley) released a board game based on this video game (same name) the same year, 'One Wrong Leap Will Get You Squished And Splattered' : in this version of the game, 2 players face off, each with their own army of frogs, logs, and automobiles. Each turn, a player spends his movement points either moving his frogs toward their goal (the other side of the board), or moving logs and cars in an attempt to block or squash the other player's frogs. Complete with 'bonus points' for landing on flies, this is actually a pretty faithful interpretation of the video-game; but far too simple to have any long-lasting interest. More of a curiosity for video game enthusiasts than anything. [CR]Frogger also spawned a cartoon series of the same name : Ruby-Spears Productions. Produced By Joe Ruby, Ken Spears. Originally aired September 17, 1983 as part of 'Saturday Supercade' on CBS. [CR]Michael Jackson used to own this game. It was sold at the official Michael Jackson Auction on April 24, 2009.[CR]The Main character appear, on the 2012 animation movie "Wreck-It Ralph" from Walt Disney Animation Studios.[CR][B]Scoring[/B][CR]Forward Hop : 10 points (max points per home is 100)[CR]Frog Safely Put in Home : 50 points[CR]Completing a Level : 1000 points[CR]Bringing a Frog to Your Home : 200 points[CR]Eating a Fly : 200 points[CR]You also get a time bonus of 10 x the remaining seconds added to your score.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* When you start the game, your frog will start at the bottom of the screen. You will have 60 seconds to move your frog up 10 spaces and successfully put it in their home. If you are successful, then you will try to put a frog in the next home and so on until you fill up all five homes with frogs. When you do this, you progress to the next level. [CR]* Note the traffic flow of the 2 parts. The cars travel on the roadway from left to right while the logs, turtles, crocodiles, etc. travel on the water lanes in the following direction : [CR]a) Lanes #1, #3, and #5 go from right to left. [CR]b) Lanes #2 and #4 go from left to right. [CR]* First, you must cross the highway. You will become road kill if a vehicle hits you or you hit a vehicle. Try to find 'lanes' in between the vehicles. You must plan for gaps to form in the first three lanes so you don't become trapped. The vehicles in the first three lanes move slowly enough that you can jump side to side with reasonable safety. [CR]* Lane #4 is the dangerous lane. Depending on how much time you are taking, the cars may pick up speed even though it shows slow on the chart. Keep this in mind when you are moving your frog. [CR]* At level 3, a snake will either be in the median or on the log in water lane #3. The snake is deadly to your frog and you cannot hop over it. [CR]* The turtles are pretty easy to navigate over in water lanes #1 and #4. Be wary of the diving turtles and only use them as a quick bypass to a more solid footing. If your frog is on a diving turtle when it dives, your frog will drown. [CR]* Again, time your jumps to coincide with the logs and turtles to ensure you will always have a solid footing to jump to. As the levels progress, you will have less things you can jump to. [CR]* You can jump on the backs of the crocodiles and otters. Just don't get near their mouths or they are apt to turn your frog into a meal. [CR]* You may see a purple lady frog hopping around on a log in water lane #2. Just cross over her to give her a piggyback ride to your home and get an extra 200 points. [CR]* Watch out for the snakes, they sometimes like to ride on the logs. If you see a snake on a log, jump back to solid footing. [CR]* Your frog cannot 'wrap-around' the screen so make sure you bail off before that footing disappears off the edge of the screen or your frog will come out the other side in a squished condition. [CR]* By that same token, if you have the time and necessary footing, you can hold out until the fly appears in your home before you settle your frog in. That's another 200 points. [CR]* Try to fill in the two end homes before going for the middle. The hardest home to get into is the left-hand one (home #1) since everything in water lane #5 goes from right to left. This means you may have to bounce back to water lane #4 so you can get a good shot at your home. [CR]* Speaking of getting your frogs into their homes, you must hit exact center or your frog will die. Also, keep in mind that crocodiles like to randomly appear in your home. Make sure that your home is clear before trying to settle your frog down into it. [CR]* Again, if you waste too much time, the things on the river will move quicker so you will have to adjust your strategy accordingly. [CR]* When the game is playing in attract mode, you can control the frog. When the frog reaches water lane #4, you can control the frog's movements until you move either up or down. [CR]* If you jump into your home at the same time the crocodile is leaving your home, you will be credited with making to your home but you will still lose a frog in the process. [CR]* You can dangle your frog from the left side of the turtles but not the right side. [CR]* Your side-to-side movements in water lane #5 may be slow and sluggish. [CR]* The lady frog will sometimes be invisible. In this case, the only time you know she's there is when you jump on her. She will then ride on your back to your home.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

		<plot>Star Wars (c) 1983 Atari, Incorporated.[CR]Star Wars is a single-player 3-D shoot-em-up based on the legendary movie franchise of the same name. This game is specifically based on the very first Star Wars movie, 'Episode IV: A New Hope'. The player takes on the role of Luke Skywalker (Red Five) whose goal is to blow up the infamous "Death Star" by firing a Proton Torpedo into an exposed exhaust port situated on the Death Star's surface. [CR]Before reaching the exhaust port, players must survive three attack phases. [CR]PHASE 1 : The game begins in outer space above the Death Star. Players must engage in a dog fight with Darth Vader and numerous enemy TIE Fighters. All but Vader's fighter can be shot and destroyed. Incoming enemy fire must be avoided or shot to prevent damage to the player's Deflector shields. [CR]PHASE 2 : The X-Wing flies down to the surface of the Death Star and is confronted with a barrage of laser turrets and towers as the X-Wing flies across the Death Star's surface. Any collisions with either the towers or incoming enemy shots will cause damage to the player's Deflector Shields. [CR]The laser tower tops have a progressive scoring incentive that is displayed at the top center of the screen, along with the number of remaining laser tower tops that need to be destroyed before the X-Wing enters the exhaust port trench. If the player manages to destroy all of the towers, a sizeable point bonus is awarded. [CR]PHASE 3 : The X-Wing begins its approach down the trench of the Death Star, heading for the exhaust port situated at the end of the trench. The trench walls are lined with red laser-gun turrets that fire at the player as he makes his approach. Incoming fire must either be avoided or shot. Trench catwalks of varying shapes and heights also appear in later trench runs. These must be avoided as any collision results in damage to Red 5's deflector shields. [CR]If the player survives the trench run, the voice of 'Han Solo' will advise that 'You're all clear, Kid' and the player must quickly shoot the exhaust port to destroy the Death Star. If a trench run is completed without the player having fired any shots other than the shot into the exhaust port, a sizeable point bonus is awarded for 'using the force'. If the exhaust port is missed, Red 5 will plough through the wall at the end of the trench and lose one deflector shield, after which the trench run will start over. [CR]If the player succeeds in blowing up the Death Star, Red 5 makes its escape before turning to view the colourful explosion. Bonus points for Remaining Shield Energy is now scored. [CR]The player is then returned to the fray and whole process begins again. Each successive Death Star run greatly increases in difficulty; TIE Fighters shoot more often, there are more Laser towers and batteries in successive rounds and there are many more obstacles and laser fire during the trench run.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR][Upright model][CR]Game ID : 136021[CR]Main CPU : Motorola M6809 (@ 1.512 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU : Motorola M6809 (@ 1.512 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : (4x) POKEY (@ 1.512 Mhz), Texas Instruments TMS5220 (@ 640 Khz)[CR]Screen orientation : Horizontal[CR]Players : 1[CR]Control : Flight Yoke (Custom Specs)[CR]Buttons : 4[CR]The Star Wars Yoke pivots left to right to control the X position.

The controls were adapted from the controls used for Army "Battle Zone".[CR]Star Wars was the first Atari game to have speech. The game featured several digitized samples of voices from the movie. The most memorable was the voice of Obi-Wan Kenobi, after losing the game, stating 'The force will be with you--always'.[CR]Hidden In-game Message : On odd-numbered levels, when approaching the Death Star and right after hitting the exhaust port, the message 'MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU' is visible on the surface of the Death Star. On even-numbered levels, the programmer's names appear on the Death Star :[CR]'HALLY'[CR]'RIVERA'[CR]'MARGOLIN'[CR]'AVELLAR'[CR]'VICKERS'[CR]'DURFEY'[CR]Attract mode has the following screens :[CR]FLIGHT INSTRUCTIONS TO RED FIVE[CR]1.

The text 'USE THE FORCE' is shown at the top of the screen until you shoot.

		<plot>Centipede (c) 1980 Atari.[CR]Centipede is a 1- or 2-player game with a color raster-scan monitor. The fast-moving game action takes place on a magical mushroom patch and includes a variety of insects that drop down from the top of the screen or enter from the sides of the screen, most of them to attack the Bug Blaster, controlled by the player. The Bug Blaster is represented on the screen by a somewhat humanoid head. The object of the game is to shoot at and destroy as many of these insects and mushrooms as possible for a high point score, before the player's lives are all used up. [CR]Player control consists of a Mini-Trak Ball control and a FIRE button. The Bug Blaster is moved by rotating the Midi-Trak Ball control. The Bug Blaster can be moved in all directions, but only within the bottom 5th of the screen. However, the Bug Blaster must move around mushrooms, since these are fixed, not 'transparent', objects. Pressing the button causes the Bug Blaster to fire individual shots upward, either singly or in rapid-fire mode, if held down constantly. (Only one shot appears on the screen at a time.) [CR]Game play begins with a playfield of randomly-placed mushrooms in a mushroom patch. A Centipede starts snaking its way across from the center top of the screen. The Centipede changes direction when it runs into a mushroom or either the left or right boundaries of the playfield. [CR]When a segment of the Centipede is shot, it is destroyed and a mushroom appears where that segment was shot. When a body segment is shot, the Centipede breaks into two smaller Centipedes, each with its own head. When a Centipede reaches the bottom of the screen, it starts back up, but remains within the area of the Bug Blaster (the bottom fifth of the screen). [CR]If a Centipede reaches the bottom of the screen without being shot, it releases its tail. This tail changes into a new head. Also to provide the player a challenge, if a Centipede is still alive when it reaches the bottom, new heads will enter the screen almost at the bottom of the sides. More of these heads will appear as time progresses. [CR]A round of play ends when all Centipede segments are destroyed. [CR]The randomly moving Spiders also appear in the first wave. The Spiders can destroy any mushrooms they move over. This eliminates many mushroom targets for a player. Depending on a special option switch setting, the Spider moves slowly until the player reaches a specific score, and then it speeds up. If the Bug Blaster and a Spider collide, both are destroyed. [CR]Whan a Centipede with fewer than eleven body segments appears, a bombardment of Fleas starts. As a Flea descends, it leaves a trail of new mushrooms behind it. Fleas appear when a certain number of mushrooms remains at the bottom of the screen. This number increases as the game progresses, meaning Fleas appear more often later on in the game. The Bug Blaster must hit a Flea twice to destroy it; the first shot just speeds it up. [CR]When a Centipede with fewer than ten body segments appears, a Scorpion enters from either side, moving at a relatively slow speed. As the player earns more points, the Scorpion's speed increases. [CR]As the Scorpion travels across the screen, it 'poisons' the mushrooms that it moves over and changes their colors. These mushrooms cause any Centipedes that would collide with them to head straight towards the bottom of the screen, rather than continue snaking around. The Bug Blaster can stop a poisoned Centipede by shooting its head. [CR]In addition, these poisoned mushrooms as well as any partially shot mushrooms add 5 points to the player's score as the mushroom patch resets after a player loses a life. [CR]If the players are very skilled and earn at least 60,000 points, two things happen to increase player challenge : the Fleas descend at a faster speed and the Spiders restrict their movement to a smaller area at the bottom of the screen. [CR]An important new feature of this game is the operator option for easy/hard game difficulty. At Easy, the Spider moves slowly up to a 5,000-point score, and then bounces at a higher speed. It also changes direction less often throughout the game than at the hard setting. At Hard, the Spider moves slowly only for the first 1,000 points, and then speeds up. It also changes direction more often throughout the game. In either setting, the Spider always moves at a 45-degree angle or straight up and down.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Game ID : 136001 [CR]The upright models were by far the most common. All of them can be converted to "Millipede" with only minor effort. They all have control panels with a trackball, although the upright version uses a larger ball than the other ones do. All of the trackballs are prone to wear and tear, but replacement parts are readily available. The upright was in a white cabinet that was similar in construction to the Asteroids cabinet. The game featured ornate painted side-art of a truly evil looking green bug, while the monitor bezel and marquee basically copied the same picture, but from a different angle. [CR]Height: 71 in. (180.34 cm) [CR]Width: 26.75 in. (67.95 cm) [CR]Depth: 25.25 in. (64.14 cm) [CR]Main CPU : MOS Technology M6502 (@ 1.512 Mhz) [CR]Sound Chips : POKEY (@ 1.512 Mhz) [CR]Players : 2 [CR]Control : trackball [CR]Buttons : 1 (FIRE)[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]The original Upright model of Centipede was released in June 1981, and was sold $1,995 at its release. 46,062 units were produced. It's Atari's second bestselling coin-op game. [CR]It was an Atari coin-operated game that swiftly won a wide following in the arcades. Apart from its smooth game play, Centipede was praised for its refreshing approach to screen colors and for its whimsical mushroom world. [CR]Centipede was the first coin-op game to be designed by a woman - Dona Bailey. But Ed Logg did the majority of the work on Centipede; Dona only came up with the prototype idea, where the mushrooms were indestructible and it was more like "Space Invaders". Like "Pac-Man", this game has special appeal to women. [CR]* The Creation of Centipede : Centipede was written by veteran Atari designer Ed Logg, who has become something of a legend in the world of video games, and a young game programmer who was credited with bringing a gentler touch to the world of video games with the enchanted mushroom patch. [CR]Steve Calfee : 'Ed Logg is the world's greatest games designer. He's done the most, the best games. His line up starts with "Asteroids", which probably still is the biggest run we ever did. He's in [a long line of games]. He's kind of like Pete Rose; he has the most hits and he's also probably got the most strike outs. He just goes up to bat.' [CR]* Remembrances from the Video Game Masters : The mushroom patch with its tenacious, never-say-die centipedes, bouncing spiders, mushroom-laying fleas and transforming scorpions provided an imaginative leap for players, just as did the hoards of aliens in "Tempest", the outer space adventures of "Asteroids", the eerie battlefields of "Battlezone" and even the frightful scenarios of "Missile Command". Of these times, and the games that emerged from Atari, Rich Adam said : 'We were a young group of fun people who were sort of treading on untrodden territory. We were out exploring what technology could do to entertain adolescent minds, and we were adolescent minds.' [CR]In the early days of personal computers, before they became commonplace, and before sophisticated gaming programs were available for them, the arcades (and wherever else the coin-operated games were located) were the portals into these new fantasy worlds. And a river of quarters carried players into the electronic realms. Dan Pliskin described the coin-operated video game business as follows : "It was a wacky, extremely competitive business. I was there when coin-operated games were earning $8 billion in quarters a year. These games were out-grossing the record industry and the movie industry combined, in quarters! And when you looked at who was manufacturing these games, it was just a couple of Japanese companies and a few American companies.... There was incredible competition, all for kids' lunch and church money!" [CR]The quarters are still rolling in. Dan Plishkin continued : "People say that video games have already seen their heyday and business has definitely gone downhill. Maybe it has gone downhill. Maybe it's only $4 billion worth of quarters now. It's still one heck of an industry." [CR]* Popular from the Start : The prototype games were hand-built, wire-wrapped, one-of-a kinds that were created by the development team prior to ordering the circuit boards for the mass-produced versions. With just a single machine, people would come in at all hours of the night to play a new game. [CR]Dan Plishkin : 'One of the things that kind of allowed everybody at Atari to have kind of a loose and enjoyable relationship was that management was kind of loose, too. An example of that happened with one of Howard Delman's games. I can't remember which one it was, but we sent the one and only prototype wire-wrapped version of Howie's game off to the AMOA (Amusement and Music Operators Association) show with strict orders not to sell it.' [CR]Of course the game was sold anyway, and a new prototype had to be assembled back at the labs. Dan Plishkin continued : 'Several months later Howie gets a call from the person who bought this game. It had stopped collecting money and he wanted to know how to change the settings to make it play longer, or something, to see if it would earn more money. Howie had to tell the guy that if it ever collected any money at all, it was a miracle because it didn't have any coin routines at all. It had none, because we had wired it for free-play when we sent it to the AMOA show!' [CR]* The Great 25-Cent Escape : Especially in the early 1980s a great many newspaper and magazine articles were written about the meaning of and possible consequences of the wave of video games that seemed to allure so many kids, and adults, to the arcades. But at the heart of it might have been the promise of a quick escape into another world. [CR]Rich Adam : "I kind of figured out, maybe years after the fact, what I think the lure of video games is. It's because people have so little control over their lives. This is especially true with kids, but even adults often have little control over the day-to-day part of their lives. You have to go to work. You don't get to control that much of your life. But for a quarter you can control this very complex machine. You can command it. For a quarter that's quite a bargain, to be able to do that for five minutes... When you're good at a game it gives you an incredible sense of power over the whole environment.". [CR]Centipede was the 1st UL (Underwriter's Laboratories) approved game. [CR]Jim Schneider holds the official record for this game on 'Marathon' settings with 16,389,547 points on August 1, 1984. [CR]Donald Hayes holds the official record for this game on 'Tournament' settings with 7,111,111 points on November 5, 2000. [CR]Note 1 : The upright side artwork features a grasshopper, while it is not present during game-play. In test mode you can cycle through the different graphical objects used in the game (the player, a mushroom, a spider, a scorpion, a flea and a grasshopper). Grasshopper?! Yes, the game was to originally have had grasshoppers but they were taken out. You can still see them in the test however. [CR]Note 2 : 'Centipede' is also the name of a terrifying, man-eating monster of the size of a mountain. This Japanese legend say that the dragon king of that particular lake asked the famous hero Hidesato to kill it for him. The hero slew it by shooting an arrow, dipped in his own saliva, into the brain of the monster. The dragon king rewarded Hidesato by giving him a rice-bag; a bag of rice which could not be emptied and it fed his family for centuries. [CR]Centipede inspired a catchy hit song by Buckner and Garcia called 'Ode To A Centipede' released on the 'Pac-Man Fever' album. [CR]The default high score screen of "Cyberball 2072" features names of many Atari arcade games, including CENTIPED. [CR]A Centipede unit appears in the 1982 movie "Fast Times at Ridgemont High", in the 1983 movie "WarGames", in the 1983 movie "James Bond 007 - Never Say Never Again", in the 1983 movie "Joysticks", in the 1984 movie "Body Double", in the 1985 movie "Teen Wolf", in the 1986 movie "Running Scared", in the 1987 movie "Death Wish 4 - The Crackdown", in the 1995 movie "Species" and in the 1996 movie 'House Arrest'. [CR]In 1982, Atari released a set of twelve collector pins including : "Missile Command", "Battle Zone", "Tempest", "Asteroids Deluxe", "Space Duel", "Centipede", "Gravitar", "Dig Dug", "Kangaroo", "Xevious", "Millipede" and "Food Fight". [CR]MB (Milton Bradley) released a boardgame based on Atari's Centipede. [CR]A Reimagined version of the Centipede franchise, was launched for the Nintendo 3DS and Nintendo Wii under name of "Centipede Infestation".[CR][B]Scoring[/B][CR]Mushrooms &amp; Poisoned Mushrooms : 1 point (Takes four hits to destroy) [CR]Centipede (Body) : 10 points [CR]Centipede (Head) : 100 points [CR]Flea : 200 points (Takes two hits. First hit speeds it up, second hit destroys it) [CR]Spider : 300, 600, 900 points (Points increase the closer the Spider is to the Bug Blaster when hit) [CR]Scorpion : 1,000 points [CR]When the mushroom patch is reset after a player loses a life, each partially destroyed/poisoned mushroom that is restored awards the player 5 bonus points.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* When you start the game, you will be put in the middle at the bottom of the screen. You have an area five mushrooms high (about 20% of the playing area) to maneuver your Bug Blaster in. The game will start when the enemies enter the screen. Know your enemies! This is the single most important aspect of this game. If you don't know how each of the enemies behave, you won't last long. The enemies are : [CR]1) Centipede (Body and Head) : Goes back and forth across the screen. Will drop to the next level when it encounters a mushroom or the side of the game field. It will go all the way to the bottom when it hits a poisoned mushroom. [CR]2) Spider : These appear from the top left or right of the player area. They will either bounce across the player's area at 45-degree angles or bounce in at a 45-degree angle, bounce up and down a couple of times, go to the middle at a 45-degree angle, bounce up and down a couple of times, then finally go to the right side (at a 45-degree angle), bounce up and down, then exit the area. They destroy mushrooms they cross over. [CR]3) Flea : These appear in Wave 2. They will appear when you have cleared out most of the mushrooms in the player area.[CR]4) Scorpion : These appear in Wave 3. They go across the screen and poison all the mushrooms in their path. [CR]* The Centipede will start out as a head and eleven body segments on Wave 1. Wave 2 will be a head with ten body segments and a head that enters from the opposite side. Wave 3 will be a head with nine body segments and two heads that enter from opposite sides. This progression keeps going until Wave 12 when all that enter the screen are heads. The progression then starts back up again in a never ending cycle. [CR]* You must eliminate the Wave 1 Centipede only once. Then, until you score reaches 40,000 points, you must destroy each subsequent Centipede wave twice--first as the Centipede moves slowly towards you, then as it moves fast. After your score reaches 40,000 points, each Centipede will only need to be destroyed once. [CR]* Shooting the Centipede can have two effects : [CR]1) If you shoot the head, that part turns into a mushroom and the next segment becomes the new head and the Centipede will travel in the opposite direction (since it hit the newly-created mushroom). [CR]2) If you shoot the middle of the body, then the segment hit will become a mushroom. The old Centipede will continue in the same direction. The new Centipede will develop a head at the next segment after the break and head off in the opposite direction. [CR]* A good strategy to ensure you destroy the Centipedes in one stroke and to keep the Fleas at bay is to create 'mushroom corridors'. Mushroom corridors are basically corridors between two rows of mushrooms where you can funnel the Centipede down and destroy it when it is moving head-first at your Bug Blaster. [CR]* A good defense against the Flea is to keep a certain amount of mushrooms on the screen. There is no hard set value but when the Fleas don't come down, you have enough. This number gets higher as your score increases. [CR]* Speaking of score, Fleas start traveling faster after 60,000 points. [CR]* Watch out for the Spiders. They enter at either the top or bottom corners. Your Bug Blaster may be in the way if this happens. In addition to collisions, the Spiders wipe out all mushrooms that are in its path. This can create problems when you are creating mushroom corridors. It can also cause the Fleas to appear since you won't have many mushrooms in the player area. [CR]* Spiders are unpredictable, so be careful. Sometimes they pounce using long, high leaps and sometimes it bounces in a series of short jumps. Aim your shots and plan your moves based on where the Spider is, and not where you think it is going.[CR]* Remember that Spiders never turn back. Once one passes your Bug Blaster on its journey from one side of the mushroom patch to the next, you can ignore it. If the Spider emerges from the right side of the screen, it will work its way toward the left side of the screen, and vice versa. It may pause along its way to bounce straight up and down, but it will never reverse direction.[CR]* Blast the Fleas! They are relatively easy to pick off, especially once you get good at moving your Bug Blaster smoothly across the bottom of the screen. Be careful, though! It takes two shots to kill a Flea and after the first hit the falling speed increases.[CR]* Blast the Fleas as soon as you can. Stop them from laying mushrooms because you'll just have to blast them out of the way later. The more mushroom on the screen (especially in the player area), the more quickly the Centipedes work their way to the bottom. [CR]* If you don't like Fleas, always leave five mushrooms in your area (out of your line of fire). Fleas stop falling when there are five or more mushrooms in the player area. But be on the lookout for Spiders. They destroy mushrooms and if the count drops below five, the Fleas start falling again.[CR]* Keep track of where the Scorpions move across the screen. As soon as the Centipede hits a poisoned mushroom, it will immediately head for the bottom of the screen. The only way to stop this headlong plunge is to shoot it in the head. In the later waves, it is not uncommon to have multiple Scorpions going across the screen. They also provide the most points in the game, but they are hard to get. Often rows of mushrooms protect them. [CR]* Play the cycles. As the waves progress and more Centipede segments are entering the mushroom patch as independent heads, put more effort into blasting the heads than into chasing Fleas and Spiders. If your area gets too crowded with Centipede heads, you'll have to move your Bug Blaster with exceptional speed and smoothness to stay alive.[CR]* If you get unlucky and let the Centipede into your area, you need to destroy it before it gets to the bottom of the player area. Once it reaches the bottom, it will ascend (it will never leave the player area, though). If it does reach the bottom of the player area, another head will come out from the opposite side to start its back and forth march across the screen. This will continue until you destroy all the Centipede parts in the player area or until your Bug Blaster is destroyed.[CR]* If your Bug Blaster gets destroyed, all partially shot up mushrooms are regenerated, all poisoned mushrooms are restored to normal, and you start at the beginning of the wave you got killed on. [CR]* Depending on machine set up, all enemies (except the Centipede and Flea) speed up at the 1,000 or 5,000 point mark. [CR]* Bottom Side Tunnels : To perform this trick, you must do the following... [CR]1) When the Centipede is one row over the player's area (fifth mushroom up), go to the opposite side that the Centipede is on. [CR]2) When the Centipede turns around, it will be in the player's area. It then will make it to the side you are on. Right when it hits the side of the screen and turns around, shoot it. This creates a mushroom and forces the Centipede to turn around and go down one level. [CR]3) Again, after the Centipede hits the wall, shoot it, create a mushroom, and force it down another level. [CR]4) Continue to do this until you have only the bottom part left. There are two ways to do this : [CR]a) If you get killed by the Centipede, this will also create a mushroom and you will have a vertical line of mushrooms along one of the side. [CR]b) If you are quick, you can pick off the Centipede and create this last mushroom. [CR]5) Repeat this for the other side. [CR]6) Regardless of how you create this 'Side Tunnel', you will now have a trapped Centipede since the only thing it can do is go up and down within the player's area. New heads that come out will also be trapped. [CR]7) Now you can pick off enemies at your leisure. The only enemy you need to make sure you take out is the Spider since it can wipe out part of your 'Side Tunnel'. [CR]8) Good players consider this 'cheating' since it basically lets the player have free reign over the game. [CR]* Central Tunnel : This trick works along the same line as the 'Bottom Side Tunnel' trick. The difference is that you create a tunnel down the center of the screen... [CR]1) When the Centipede starts its descent, hit it. This will cause it to reverse direction after hitting the new mushroom. [CR]2) After going one or two mushroom lengths, hit it. Again, this will cause it to reverse direction. [CR]3) Continue to do this until you have built a 'tunnel' that touches the player's area. [CR]4) Also make sure you build up mushrooms to the left and right of the tunnel to prevent the Fleas from coming down and depositing their random mushrooms. [CR]5) From this point on, when the Centipede approaches your tunnel, all it will take is one hit to force it to descend. In a sense, you are causing the same effect that a Scorpion causes, but on your terms. [CR]6) Since you are keeping the top left and right areas clear, it should take a longer time for the individual heads to make it to the player's area. [CR]7) It will take a few waves to build up your areas. Once built up, you should be the master of the game. [CR]8) As for the other tunnel, make sure you take care of the Spiders when they first enter so they don't do any damage to your 'Central Tunnel'. [CR]9) Also make sure that you keep your tunnel cleared out by destroying any stray mushrooms within it. [CR]* Fortress : If you are patient, you could build a mushroom fortress around your Bug Blaster. Then all you would do is shoot Spiders for the rest of the game.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

		<plot>Joust (c) 1982 Williams.[CR]Joust is a platform-based action combat game for one or two-players (with the two-player game offering either team-up OR head-to-head combat; the first time arcade gamers were given this choice) in which each player controls a knight riding on the back of a flying ostrich. [CR]The object of the game is to progress through platform-based levels by defeating groups of buzzard-riding enemy knights. This is achieved by 'jousting'; both enemy and player knights carry a lance and must fly around the level (actioned by repeatedly hitting the 'Flap' button) trying to oust rival knights from their steeds by ramming them with the lance. This can only be achieved if the attacking rider is above the enemy knight when the lance connects. A collision of equal elevations results in the two knights bouncing off each other, but if a player is lower than their enemy at the instant of contact, they themselves will be knocked from their steed and lose a life. [CR]A defeated enemy will turn into an egg that falls to the bottom of the screen. This must be quickly collected by players as if the egg lands on a platform and isn't retrieved in time, it will eventually hatch into another enemy knight that must be defeated again. [CR]Joust features three different types of enemy knights - Bounder, Hunter, and Shadow Lord - with each earning players different points values when defeated. A pterodactyl will appear after a predetermined time to hunt the players. [CR]Accurately navigating the player Knights can be initially quite difficult as control is strongly affected by both gravity and inertia. Players can lose a life by either being knocked from their steed by an enemy knight, or by falling into the lava pit at the bottom of each level.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]* The upright version of Joust was a dedicated cabinet. It is similar in shape to other Williams games from that era, but it is not identical to them. The cabinet is largely black with no painted art on the front of the machine. But it does have sideart, in this case a four-color painted rendering of a knight riding a large bird, while carrying a lance. This design is fairly simple when compared to the sideart on other games, and can be repainted by hand, as long as you are careful. The control panel, monitor bezel, and marquee are all filled with the expected graphics. The marquee especially is a stunning rendition of the Joust logo, and two riders inside the Joust world. Your Joust machine will come with either 2-way leaf switch joysticks, or 2-way optical ones. The early cabinets had the optical ones, while the later ones used the leaf stick ones. [CR]* The cocktail version (a cocktail game is a sit down table version), is notable because it was one of the most popular cocktail cabinets for conversion to newer titles. You see most cocktail tables originally held games that had monitors in a vertical orientation, and had a set of player controls on each end of the table. By 1985 no one was really making many vertical games, especially not ones that were one player at a time, and could flip the screen for the second player. But the Joust table was different. It had a horizontal monitor, and the players sat side by side, instead of at opposite ends of the table. This allowed the Joust cocktail cabinet to be used for all sorts of newer games. Electronically the cocktail version of Joust was identical to the upright version. The cocktail cabinet did not feature a lot of art, and was mostly black.[CR]The Joust PCBs are functionally identical to those used in "Defender", "Robotron - 2084", "Bubbles", "Sinistar", and "Stargate", only the ROM chips are different.[CR]Main CPU : Motorola M6809 (@ 1 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU : M6808 (@ 894.75 Khz)[CR]Sound Chips : DAC[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 2-way joystick (LEFT and RIGHT)[CR]Buttons : 1 (FLAP)[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Joust was released in September 1982. [CR]The name of this game is a reference for 'Jousting'. Jousting is a competition between two knights on horse-back, wherein each knight tries to knock the other off his mount. Jousting was popular in medieval times. [CR]Joust shares some sounds from "Defender" and "Stargate". [CR]James Vollandt holds the official record for this game on 'Marathon' settings with 107,216,700 points. [CR]Don Morlan holds the official record for this game on 'Tournament' settings with 1,002,500 points. [CR]A Joust unit appears in the 1983 movie 'Joysticks'. [CR]A Joust unit appears (multiple times) in a 'Columbo' tv movie episode : (Murder, Smoke and Shadows) directed by James Frawley.[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]Red version has a default high score of 107,212 points, Green and Yellow versions have 109,102 points as the default high score. Also, the Green version fixes a well known bug that allowed you to endlessly kill Pterodactyls on certain levels, thus achieving incredible scores.[CR][B]Scoring[/B][CR]Killing enemies : [CR]Bounder (Red) : 500 points. [CR]Hunter (Silver/Gray) : 750 points. [CR]Shadow Lord (Blue) : 1,000 points. [CR]Pterodactyl : 1,000 points. [CR]Getting killed : 50 points. [CR]Picking up eggs or hatchlings : 250, 500, 750, or 1,000 points (progressive). The progression starts again when the player is killed or starts the next wave. [CR]Picking up an egg before it touches the ground : 500 points. [CR]Not dying during a Survival Wave : 3,000 points. [CR]If neither player kills the other during a Team Wave (2-player game only) : 3,000 points for each player. [CR]The first player who kills the other player during a Gladiator Wave (2-player game only) : 3,000 points.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* When you start the game, your man will be at the entry point at the bottom of the playing field. From the other entry points, enemy riders will appear. It will then be up to you to successfully defeat them. Learning to flap your ostrich's wings is the most vital aspect of this game. How fast or slow you flap the wings determines speed and maneuverability. Once you get good, you will be able to glide around and only flap for either altitude or to hit an enemy rider.[CR]* The name of the game is height. Whoever is the higher rider during a joust is the winner. If you and an enemy collide on the same level, the impact will knock you both backwards a little and turn you both around. This can prove to be dangerous if more then one enemy is coming for you since the first one turns you around and the second knocks you off your mount.[CR]* You need to pay particular attention to the screen setup on each wave. Different platforms may collapse forcing you to readjust your strategy accordingly. Using the 20-wave example from Chapter 6.4, I will give you some basic strategies...[CR]a) During the non-pterodactyl waves and platform one is intact, your best bet is to hang out under the right side of platform one. The enemy riders have to drop to get to you.  Just a quick press of the flap button should give you altitude over them and the easy kill.[CR]b) If you lose platform one, the next best place is platform five. This forces the enemy riders to rise up to you. If you hover over the left or right edge, you can drop on enemy riders trying to rise up from the areas of platforms two and three. Of course, if any make it to your level, just sit on that entry point. When an enemy rider gets near, rapidly climb and move over toward the enemy to knock them off their mount.[CR]c) When you only have platforms two and three, you will use a modified strategy from the one above. You will hover around the area that platform five was at. This forces the enemy riders to rise up to you, thereby exposing themselves to you dropping down on them.[CR]d) If any of the above have Shadow Lords in them, you will have to be prepared to move around quickly since Shadow Lords are very fast and they tend to bounce off the top of the game screen.[CR]* There are a couple of ways to kill off the pterodactyl during the pterodactyl waves :[CR]1) First of all, you must be facing the pterodactyl in order to kill it.[CR]2) If platform one still exists, then just wait for the pterodactyl and be ready for it to choke itself on your lance. If there are multiple pterodactyls, they usually come from opposite sides so the first one will have you turned around to meet the second one.[CR]3) If platform one is gone, they use platform two to do your prehistoric hunting. If there are multiple pterodactyls, then you will have to move around until the second and subsequent pterodactyls are coming at your rider head on while you sit atop platform two.[CR]4) If you are real good, you can kill the pterodactyls off in the air. You just have to make sure that your lance is evenly aligned with the pterodactyls mouth.[CR]5) Pterodactyls also show up if you take too long on a wave. These can't be killed using the platform method. The only way is either in the air or to lose a man.[CR]6) Some players take out all the enemy riders but one. Then they lead this rider toward the lave so the Lava Troll can grab them. The player then sits and hunts pterodactyls. This is a long process that is definitely loaded with peril.[CR]7) If you get killed before killing the pterodactyl, it is very hard to get in position to kill the pterodactyl since it does involve a sort of rhythm. Also keep in mind that the enemy riders will still be trying to dismount you as you are hunting.[CR]* The Pterodactyl Trick : Classic trick! Doesn't work on upgraded Joust machines, or on "Joust 2". Trick the last jouster on the stage to fly to the lava and get trapped by the lava troll. Then wait in the center of the middle platform. When a pterodactyl comes out, it'll fly right into your lance. The next part takes a fair amount of practice : When the pterodactyl has hit you, your character will be knocked back. Jiggle the joystick so that your mount is back in the middle of the ledge again. Keep doing this. Eventually there'll be a steady stream of pterodactyls and you'll be killing 'em about two per second, for 1,000 points each. When you make a mistake and get killed, the trapped jouster will escape. On the last board in which this works (47), the jouster will not escape.[CR]* The Lava Troll hazard isn't too major unless you fly too close to the surface of the lava. If you do happen to get grabbed, flap rapidly to escape.  It is also easy to hit enemies immobilized by the troll.[CR]* After you hit an enemy rider, they become an egg. After a few seconds, the egg will hatch to the next hardest enemy rider. For example, a Bounder becomes a Hunter; a Hunter becomes a Shadow Lord. After that, it will always be a Shadow Lord. Some players leave one egg and then hover over it. When the enemy buzzard comes to pick up the rider, you knock him off the saddle again and collect the points. Again, the pterodactyl will show up soon to end this fun.[CR]* Make sure you don't knock too many enemy riders off at once or there will be eggs scattered all over the place. This makes it hard to keep the enemy population down to a dull roar.[CR]* Whenever your rider gets killed, he will appear at the entrance point all shimmery. If you let the sequence go, it will take up to five seconds for your rider to appear. During that time, he is immune to all attacks. Your rider will enter at the point there is the least amount of enemies. This is usually the very bottom platform. Keep in mind, the enemies also enter at these points.[CR]* The game does reach a point where there are so many enemy riders running around, they are constantly bumping into one another. This, in effect, creates a wall which is very difficult and hazardous to navigate through. This means you have to split up the enemy[CR]* If you die during a wave, try quickly to get your bearings so that you can get in position to continue depleting the enemy forces.[CR]* The above tips are as valid for the two-player game as they are for the one-player game. In the two-player game, though, you and the other player can cover each other to make it more difficult for the enemy to knock you off your mounts.[CR]* Phantom Energizer : In a two-player game (on a screen just before the middle ledge disappears) clear all opponents except one. Kill him, leaving the egg in the middle of the bottom platform. Player 1 stands on the bottom energizer while player 2 jumps in the lava. If player 2 appears on the top energizer, then the trick will work. Player 1 then gets the egg. The 'phantom' ledge should remain.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1. Joust (1982)[CR]2.

		<plot>Dig Dug (c) 1982 Namco.[CR]Dig Dug is a 1- or 2-player game with a color raster-scan video display. The screen shows a cutaway view of the land, most of which is below ground. The player controls the Dig Dug character who travels through and digs tunnels in the dirt. The object is for Dig Dug to destroy monsters by pumping them up or dropping rocks on them and to capture vegetables. [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] takes place on a cutaway section of the land. The characters are Dig Dug and two monsters - one is a round, orange monster with goggles called Pooka, the other is a green, fire-breathing dragon named Fygar. The underground area is divided into four different colored layers of dirt. Rocks are scattered in the dirt. The sky is at the top of the screen. [CR]The player controls Dig Dug, the hero of the garden, clad in white. He moves through horizontal and vertical tunnels. When Dig Dug digs new tunnels he moves slowly. When he is on the surface or in an existing tunnel, he moves faster. The object of the game is for Dig Dug to destroy all the monsters and go to the next round. [CR]Monsters are trapped in caves. A monster may get out of a cave two ways. Dig Dug may dig him out. Then, the monster chases Dig Dug. The monster may also get out of the cave by turning into a ghost. As a ghost, he cannot be destroyed. The ghost does not travel in the tunnels. He travels through the dirt, and can travel diagonally. However, he reappears as the monster when he goes into a tunnel. [CR]The monsters move faster than Dig Dug in vertical tunnels and slower on the surface. They destroy Dig Dug by catching him. In addition, Fygar can destroy Dig Dug by breathing fire on him. Fygar can only breathe fire horizontally. The fire can also penetrate thin layers of dirt. [CR]Dig Dug destroys the monsters by pumping them up until they burst, or by causing rocks to drop on them. To pump up and destroy a monster, the player presses and holds down the Pump button. It is possible to stun a monster for a few seconds by pressing the pump button once or twice. While a monster is stunned, Dig Dug may pass over him without being destroyed. If two monsters are very close together, only one may be stunned. The other will catch and destroy Dig Dug. [CR]Dig Dug must dig tunnels under the rocks to get them to drop. A rock may fall in a vertical or horizontal tunnel. A rock also goes through a thin layer of dirt from one tunnel to the next. In a vertical tunnel, Dig Dug may stay directly under a rock and it will not drop. However, in a horizontal tunnel, Dig Dug must move out from under a rock right away, or he will be crushed. [CR]After two rocks are dropped, a vegetable (worth extra points, see Scoring below) appears in a tunnel in the center of the screen. Dig Dug has ten seconds to capture (touch) the vegetable or it will disappear. There is only one vegetable per round. [CR]The game progresses by rounds. Round 1 starts with four monsters (one Fygar and three Pookas) and three rocks. The vegetable is a carrot. One flower on the surface (top right of the screen) represents Round 1. Two flowers represent Round 2, etc. As the rounds progress, the monsters move a little faster, and are better at avoiding falling rocks. In each round, the last monster tries to escape. If he is not caught by Dig Dug, he exits on the surface (top left). [CR]The game ends when all of Dig Dug's lives are used up. A player may continue to play at the beginning of the same round (level) by following instructions on the screen. He or she has 16 seconds to insert a coin(s). Then he or she must push and hold the Pump and Start buttons at the same time.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Main CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 3.072 Mhz) [CR]Sub CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 3.072 Mhz) [CR]Sound CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 3.072 Mhz) [CR]Sound Chips : Namco 3-channel WSG [CR]Players : 2 [CR]Control : 4-way joystick [CR]Buttons : 1 (PUMP)[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Dig Dug was released on April 19, 1982 in Japan.[CR]Dig Dug was a shining addition to the golden age of video games. The game's charming world and innovative game play made it an instant classic. [CR]The main character of Dig Dug has a name in Japan, 'Taizo Hori', a pun based on the phrase 'Horitai zo', or 'I want to dig!'. He is believed to be the father of "Mr. Driller".  He makes an appearance on the 2012 animation movie 'Wreck-It Ralph' from Walt Disney Animation Studios.[CR]* A place in video game history : "During the golden age of video games we saw a lot of novel approaches to gaming," said Chris Lindsey, director of the National Video Game and Coin-Op Museum in St. Louis. "'Tempest', for instance, required things of its players that we'd never seen in a video game before. You had to learn a whole new set of skills to further the game experience. Dig Dug is another game that provided a novel approach. The types of movement you had to learn, the skills you had to develop, were like none other up until that point. And this game play was combined with a really engaging subject matter, which was this guy, Dig Dug, who digs around underground after subterranean monsters, and who explodes them with a really bizarre weapon, an air pump! There was just this string of interesting, engaging things for the viewer to look at and experience while dealing with this new type of game. It really captured, and still captures, the imagination. The sounds in Dig Dug are also really distinctive. When people hear that music start to play here at the museum, they'll laugh with recognition. It's quite funny watching people play that game." [CR]* The great 25-cent escape : Lindsey enjoys seeing visitors to his museum discover a video game that rekindles memories from earlier years. [CR]"They'll say, 'Wow, I used to be great at this!' And then they'll adopt their old game-playing position -- which seems to vary almost randomly from person to person, " Lindsey said. "They drop a token in, start rolling, and then they will lose all sense of time and space, becoming completely immersed in the game. Often they'll start laughing. I had a guy yesterday who was so funny. He came in and had obviously played these video games quite a bit in years past, like many of us did. He wandered around the museum, going from game to game, and he just laughed hysterically as he remembered all the little details of each game that he had spent so much time on, so long ago." [CR]* Namco notes that after the release of Dig Dug in 1982, Namco engineers went to arcades to watch their new game being played. They noticed that "there were two completely separate groups of people. One group enjoyed blowing the enemy up with the pump. The other group enjoyed beating the enemy by dropping rocks on them". [CR]Donald Hayes holds the official record for this game with 5,142,500 points on March 24, 2011. [CR]A bootleg of this game is known as "Zig Zag". Another bootleg running on the "Galaxian" hardware was made by LAX as "Zigzag". [CR]Alfa Records released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Video Game Music - YLC-20003) on April 25, 1984. [CR]Alfa Records released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (The Best Of Video Game Music - 32XA-66) on April 25, 1986.[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]The Sidam version skips the first three layouts and starts with the layout of Round 4.[CR][B]Scoring[/B][CR]Scoring in this game is relatively complicated due to the dirt layer a monster is at and also how you kill said monster. In addition, you even get points for 'eating' dirt. [CR]* Over-inflating (bursting) monsters : [CR]Layer 1 : 200 Points [CR]Layer 2 : 300 Points [CR]Layer 3 : 400 Points [CR]Layer 4 : 500 Points [CR]NOTE : If you over-inflate a Fygar horizontally, you will get double the listed points. This is due to the fact that you are risking your life dealing with Fygar's flame breath. [CR]* Dropping rocks on monsters : [CR]1 Crushed : 1,000 Points [CR]2 Crushed : 2,500 Points [CR]3 Crushed : 4,000 Points [CR]4 Crushed : 6,000 Points [CR]5 Crushed : 8,000 Points [CR]6 Crushed : 10,000 Points [CR]7 Crushed : 12,000 Points [CR]8 Crushed : 15,000 Points [CR]* You get points for collecting the prizes : [CR]Round 1 - Carrot : 400 Points [CR]Round 2 - Rutabaga : 600 Points [CR]Round 3 - Mushroom : 800 Points [CR]Rounds 4 &amp; 5 - Cucumber : 1,000 Points [CR]Rounds 6 &amp; 7 - Eggplant : 2,000 Points [CR]Rounds 8 &amp; 9 - Bell Pepper : 3,000 Points [CR]Rounds 10 &amp; 11 - Tomato : 4,000 Points [CR]Rounds 12 &amp; 13 - Onion : 5,000 Points [CR]Rounds 14 &amp; 15 - Watermelon : 6,000 Points [CR]Rounds 16 &amp; 17 - Galaxian : 7,000 Points [CR]Round 18 onward - Pineapple : 8,000 Points [CR]When you are digging a new tunnel, you get 10 points per 5/8 inch (app. 1.6 cm.) dug.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Hints for Game Play : [CR]1) Get many monsters to follow you. Then dig a long vertical tunnel up to a rock. [CR]2) Drop the rock by digging right or left. [CR]3) Dig Dug may take extra time to turn. It is better to start turning early than to wait until the last second. [CR]4) Destroy monsters at bottom dirt level for more points. [CR]5)Use the Pump button to stun monsters. Then you may escape or walk through them. [CR]6) Don't stop next to Fygar when he is in a cave. His fire can go through a thin layer of dirt and destroy you. [CR]7) A prize appears after two rocks have been dropped. So be sure to drop two rocks in each round. [CR]* When you start the game, Dig Dug will dig a downward vertical shaft into a chamber. The floor of this chamber is the top of the third layer. It is your job to dig tunnels and keep the monsters busy. This won't be an easy task since the monsters will attempt to surround Dig Dug and permanently end his mining career. You will have a two second delay before the round starts. It shows Dig Dug digging his vertical tunnel down to his starting area. Take this time to see where all the monsters are and figure out the best course of action to take them out. [CR]* Knowing the behavior of the monsters is a crucial element of this game. Pookas travel a bit faster then Dig Dug and tend to run him down. Fygars don't have the speed but they make up for it with their fiery belch. [CR]* Dig Dug travels slower when he is busy carving tunnels. [CR]* Know the rules of dropping rocks : [CR]1) Rocks will wobble for about a second before they drop. [CR]2) Rocks drop immediately when you cut a horizontal tunnel under them. [CR]3) In vertical tunnels, the rock will stay in place as long as Dig Dug is facing it and moving. [CR]4) When you drop two rocks, the prize will appear. [CR]* Don't waste your rocks on only one monster. Try to get as many monsters crushed as possible. The best way to accomplish this is : [CR]1) Try to dig long, vertical tunnels under the rocks. Don't dig all the way to the rock or you will waste it. [CR]2) Try to get the monsters to follow you. Sort of a ''follow the leader'' type thing up that vertical tunnel. This will be especially important in the later rounds. [CR]3) If the monsters are spread out a little, do a couple of pumps on the monster that is close. This will only stun it and allow the others to catch up. [CR]4) Right before they get Dig Dug, dig the rest of the way then head off left or right. The long, vertical shaft will prevent their escape and get you big points. [CR]* There are a total of 15 unique layouts in the game. After Round 15, layouts 12-15 repeat over and over in waves of four. There are patterns for these levels. Also, after Round 36, all of the enemies will speed up. The game does not award extra man after 900,000 points; the score will simply flip over at 1,000,000. It is very easy to get a score of 999,990 by eating dirt for ten points per section. Round 256 begins with a Pooka on top of Dig Dug. Since there is no way to escape, the game is basically over, no matter how many lives the player may have left. [CR]* Avoid killing the monsters by bursting them. If you don't have a choice, try to do in the lower layers since you get more points that way. [CR]* The pump is better utilized as a delay mechanism. Inflating a monster with two pumps will immobilize it for about two seconds. With two monsters, you can pump one up, move back a little and pump the other one up. [CR]* Monsters can be released from their pens in one of two ways : [CR]1) You open up their pen by digging it open. [CR]2) They turn into 'ghosts'. While they are ghosts, Pookas appear only as goggles, and Fygars appear as a set of evil eyes and a mouth. They will rematerialize as soon as they get into a tunnel. [CR]* Watch out for the fiery breath of Fygar. They not only can let loose down a horizontal tunnel, they also can send their fire through thin layers of dirt. The best defense when caught in a horizontal tunnel with a Fygar is to immediately go up or down to avoid their breath. [CR]* The Pookas have a tendency to try to surround Dig Dug. Usually they will try to trap him from the front and behind. Watch the Pooka 'ghosts' to make sure that they are not heading toward an area that you are currently tunnelling in. [CR]* It is possible to find patterns for the different levels, but it also is difficult since there isn't a well-defined maze to work with (like in "Pac-Man"). [CR]* When there is one monster left, it will attempt to escape rather then continue to pursue Dig Dug. You can chase him to get the points or let him go. Regardless, the game will advance to the next round. [CR]* In the later rounds, it is much more profitable to collect the prizes, then try to drop rocks on the monsters since they move so quickly. [CR]* 'Eat Dirt' secret : You should try this before round 36 since everything speeds up. [CR]1) Get the game down to two Pookas. If you only leave one, it will escape thus ending the round. [CR]2) This works best in horizontal tunnels under the rocks. [CR]3) Get a Pooka to follow you, inflate as necessary to delay him a little. [CR]4) Right when you are next to the rock, inflate the Pooka once to just delay him. When he moves at your character again, move under the rock. [CR]5) Quickly turn around and start pumping the Pooka up. Using the delay of the rock dropping, you should be able to cause the Pooka to burst at the same time the rock drops on him. [CR]6) If you are successful, then the other Pooka will disappear and you can amuse yourself digging out tunnels all day long in the dirt. To return the game back to normal, drop another rock and you will go into the next round. [CR]* Ender's loop: To beat any round of Dig Dug, one must take advantage of the artificial intelligence. One way to do this is to dig out either left or right from the starting position, dig up a short way from your starting position, turn around and continue digging out your initial tunnel, then go up again (this time further away from your start position) until you are higher than the end of your first vertical tunnel. Continue from here in the opposite direction of the direction you went at the beginning of the level, until you have almost reached the vertical tunnel that exists before you start any given level of the game. Create a thin wall between you and the vertical tunnel, and pump the enemies up as they pass by - but watch out, as the Fygars can still burn you.[CR]* Late game:[CR]Score: As with most of the other early Namco 8-bit arcade games, once you have made it to 999,990 points, your score will roll over to 0. No additional extra lives will be awarded now.[CR]Flowers: The flowers that indicate the rounds on the surface of the ground will stop updating at round 69, but the indicator at the bottom of the screen will continue updating until round 99 before rolling over to round 0. At this point there will be no flowers. Once you have made it to round 101, the flowers will update again until you reach round 256 (is the "kill screen").[CR]Slow enemies: In the original arcade versions of the game by Namco, the Pookas and Fygars will slow down once you have made it to round 124, and again once you have made it to round 136. This reduction in speed will continue every twelve rounds, until you reach round 256 (which, as mentioned above, is the "kill screen" - and is described in full detail below).[CR]Kill screen: In the original Namco versions of the game, the game has a "kill screen" on round 256, which is registered by the game as round 0. The round starts with a Pooka directly on top of Dig Dug, which will cause the player to lose all of his remaining lives very quickly. The Atari revisions of the game (which changed the logo on the titles) correct this problem.[CR]* Easter Egg : [CR]1) Enter service mode. [CR]2) Keep B1 pressed and enter the following sequence : Up(x6), Right(x3), Down(x4), Left(x8). [CR]3) '(c) 1982 NAMCO LTD.' will appear on the screen.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

		<plot>Burger Time (c) 1982 Data East.[CR]Stand-alone release of "Hamburger [Model DT-126]". For more information on the game itself, please see the original release entry.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Main CPU : MOS Technology M6502 (@ 1.5 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU : MOS Technology M6502 (@ 500 Khz)[CR]Sound Chips : (2x) General Instrument AY8910 (@ 1.5 Mhz)[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 4-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 1 (PEPPER)[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Burger Time was released in November 1982. The game was originally titled "Hamburger" in Japan, but was renamed "Burger Time" before being exported internationally. [CR]The game was originally made for the DECO Cassette System, an early arcade format that pulled the game data from audio cassettes. The cassette system enjoyed a brief bit of popularity, until it was discovered that the cassettes quickly wore out, rendering the game useless. Bally/Midway licensed this title soon after its original release (October 1982), and redesigned the hardware to drop the cassette altogether. The Bally/Midway version of the game sold vast quantities when compared to the original.[CR]This stand-alone version, manufactured without Bally/Midway's involvement, features a different attract mode.[CR]When starting a new game (and a new life after getting caught), the game start display says 'Game Ready'. This was corrected to 'Get Ready' in the Bally/Midway version. It originally said 'Game Start' in "Hamburger".[CR]When the chef runs out of pepper, the 'Pepper' display blinks, but there is no warning sound.[CR]In the Data East USA version : [CR]* Gameplay is noticeably much faster than the other versions.[CR]* 'Lives' dip switch can be set to 30,000, 50,000, 80,000, or None.[CR]* The attract mode is exactly the same as the Bally/Midway version except for the different copyright information on the title screen.[CR]Bryan Wagner holds the official record for this game with 11,512,500 points on September 19, 2008.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]Stage 1[CR]The introductory stage is very spacious and balanced, and you will only have to contend with three copies of Mr. Hot Dog and one copy of Mr. Egg. No one section of the stage presents any danger since ample escape routes can be found. At most, the burger layers only need to drop through five floors, so this stage won't take you as long as some of the other stages. Use this stage to understand the nature of the enemies' movement. Note how they tend to alternate between walking across a floor and using a ladder whenever they encounter one or the other that brings them closer to your position. Setting up the layers to allow enemies to drop with them is fairly easy to do.[CR]Stage 2[CR]While this stage features the same number of enemies as the previous stage, the layout of the floors makes the top portion of the screen much safer than the bottom portion. With the limited space and choices in the lower half of the stage, it is best to save it for last when you have no choice but to clear it. Focus on getting to the top as quickly as possible, but watch out for where the enemies are appearing. Staying on a ladder for a little while is a great way to lure enemies to a lower floor than the one you intend to visit. Once the two side burgers are complete, you must venture down the center of the stage. Before you do, draw the enemies as high as possible before heading down the center. Once you're ready to clear the stage, try to lure an enemy on to a top bun before dropping it. If you time it well, the enemies can clear the stage for you faster than you could. Note that the lower floors where the burgers wait are dead ends.[CR]Stage 3[CR]Even though you must build six burgers with only three layers each, this stage is a lot tougher than it looks. This time, six enemies will pursue you, including the never-before-seen Mr. Pickle. First and foremost, you need to get out of the bottom portion of the stage as quickly as possible. And the left is not a good choice for escape routes. If the copy of Mr. Pickle that enters from that side doesn't get you, another enemy is almost sure to come down that left ladder and trap you. Instead, head immediately for the right. If you're an expert player, you may choose to complete that lower right hamburger before continuing on to the top, but the more time you spend there, the bigger opportunity you give the enemies to trap you. Beginners should climb the right side of the stage all the way to the top in order to gain a little control over the enemies' movements. Like the previous stage, focus on completing the burgers at the top before tackling the lower burgers on either side.[CR]Stage 4[CR]You may feel a little daunted by the task at hand when you first see this stage: four hamburgers composed of eight layers. That's a lot of walking. But if you remember to focus your efforts on the top buns as much as possible, you won't waste a lot of time. The ladders are arranged in such a way that continuous climbing is difficult to accomplish. Instead, you and the enemies are more likely to staircase your way through the stage in order to get around. This can be a blessing and a curse. It's good because the enemies have few direct paths or multiple options to attack you from. It's bad because you need to become very skilled at controlling Peter in order not to slow down as you progress up or down the screen. Peter can feel very sluggish on ladders, and it can be difficult at first to properly time his transitions from ladder to floor and back to ladder again. By the time you complete this stage however, you'll have plenty of practice.[CR]Stage 5[CR]If you think that this stage is easier than the last stage because there's only half as many burgers to make, you're wrong. The layout of the stage is such that you have very few options to get from one section to another. Fewer options to move means fewer chances to escape so you must plot your course through this stage very carefully in order to avoid the six enemies that will be occupying the stage with you. There are two strategies to take. One involves luring the enemies to the lower right hand portion of the stage to keep them occupied for a while. This can be risky however, since you might become trapped from above and below. The other strategy is to employ pepper more liberally, provided you have a good supply by this stage. If you intend to use pepper, and wish to make the most use out of it, be sure to freeze enemies while they are standing on top of a layer so that you can walk across the layer and send it falling several stories with the enemy on board.[CR]Stage 6[CR]This is the last new stage that you will see before the game repeats the cycle of stages over again. In the heat of the moment, it's very easy to assume that certain paths on this stage connect when in fact they don't. Total comprehension of your available escape routes will decrease your chances of getting trapped and increase your chances of survival. The burgers on the side are especially dangerous since every layer is perched on a dead end. If an enemy is following you, it's relatively easy to drop a burger layer with the enemy standing on it, but getting out of the area can be tricky if you are too slow and allow another enemy to pursue you. You'll need to employ every trick that you've learned in the previous five stages to make it out of this one. The most important thing is not to panic.[CR]Beyond Stage 28[CR]The game will continue normally until stage 28. Starting on stage 28 the enemies move about 2 1/2 times faster than they did before. After 90 seconds (if you can survive that long on one chef), they slow down to a crawl, moving one step every 5 seconds. You can still die if you run into the enemies. The chefs speed never changes. If you can make it to the top of the board (28), you can find the "safe" spot. You can hide out here until they slow down. You will need new patterns for each board to group the enemies, and wait each time for each drop. It can take 1-1 1/2 hour per board at this level.[CR][B]Game Ports[/B][CR]NOTE: Only ports released outside Japan and North America are listed here.

		<plot>Arkanoid (c) 1986 Taito Corp.[CR]After a sudden alien assault, the Arkanoid spaceship has been destroyed and the only survivor, the small 'Vaus' space vessel, has been mysteriously trapped in another dimension by an unknown enemy. The player is charged with helping the 'Vaus' overcome the security systems, as well as the many enemies that guard them, before finally finding and destroying 'DOH', the alien responsible for the attack.[CR]Arkanoid is an update of the early ball and paddle video games - and specifically of Atari's 1978 classic, "Super Breakout" - in which the player takes control of a paddle at the bottom of the screen and must use it to deflect a ball into rows of bricks at the top of the screen, thus destroying them and, eventually, clearing the screen to progress to the next level. [CR]As well as impressive and colourful graphics, Arkanoid introduced a number of new elements to the classic bat 'n' ball gameplay. Certain bricks, when destroyed, would release a power-up - in the form of a falling capsule. the player had to catch the capsule to retrieve the power-up. Among the many enhancements the power-ups provided were an increased 'bat' size, multiple balls, 'sticky' ball (which would stick to the bat and could be released when the player chose) and even a laser, which allowed the player to shoot the bricks.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Prom Stickers : A75[CR]Main CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 6 Mhz), Motorola M68705 (@ 500 Khz)[CR]Sound Chips : General Instrument AY8910 (@ 1.5 Mhz)[CR]Players: 2 (alternative)[CR]Control: Paddle[CR]Buttons: 1[CR]=&gt; Fire - Used to launch the energy ball at the start of each new round and each new life, to relaunch the energy ball after it is caught by the vaus when the C (Catch) pill is in effect, and to fire lasers when the L (Laser) pill is in effect.[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Arkanoid was released in July 1986 in Japan.[CR]Arkanoid has remained a popular game and is commonly cloned by aspiring game developers in freeware and shareware titles. Many companies have also regularly cloned the game in arcades.[CR]Arkanoid's popularity led to it being featured in "Rainbow Islands - The Story of Bubble Bobble 2", which has a whole level (four stages in all) dedicated to the game, including DOH as the level boss.[CR]Nick Mollison holds the official record for this game on extremely hard settings with 1,156,930 points on September 7, 2008. [CR]Zack Hample holds the official record for this game on normal settings with 1,658,110 points on March 13, 2000.[CR]An Arkanoid unit appears on the sitcom 'Married...

Only one extra life pill is possible per Vaus. If the pill randomizer selects a duplicate pill based on the last pill dropped, a multi-ball pill is substituted. Thus, the multi-ball pill is the only one you can get twice in a row. The randomizer uses player score as the seed, so it is possible to control which pill is dispensed by purposely breaking pill dispensing blocks with specific scores displayed.[CR]* Ball Speed: On each level, the ball will not speed up completely until it hits the back wall, so:[CR]1) Try to remove bricks from the bottom up, or punch a hole through thicker areas of bricks rather than go straight through (e.g. take out the left side of level 2 rather than the single block at the right as you will catch far more pills).[CR]2) If you have collected a lot of S pills and the ball has been in play for a bit of time, be prepared for a sudden speedup.[CR]3) Also, the D token speeds up the balls and is pretty useless on most levels (the one with the enclosed diamond is the only good example).[CR]* Multiple Balls: As only one pill can fall at a time, multiple balls can reduce your potential score quite drastically. Every pill is worth 1,000 points. For the first few levels, get every pill you can, but do not use the special powers. You will get a lot of extra ships and should get a gray P or two - thereby starting early with six or seven ships.[CR]* DOH: In the final level, where you face DOH himself, you should get 15 hits (1,000 points per hit) on DOH/per man until you defeat DOH with the 16th hit on your last man to end the game.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

		<plot>Ms. Pac-Man (c) 1981 Midway. [CR]In this, the first proper sequel to Namco's legendary pill eating maze game, players must once again run around a number of mazes, eating all of the pills that are scattered throughout. The ever-present ghosts (Blinky, Pinky, Inky and Sue) return to hamper the player's progress. The infamous 'Power Pills' are also present and correct, with four appearing in each maze. [CR]Namco introduced a number of changes and enhancements over the original game. The first difference is in the main character. For the first time in video-game history, the game's lead character was female. Ms. Pac-Man is almost identical to the original character with two main differences; she wears a bow in her 'hair', and is also wearing lipstick. [CR]Another change from the original is that the bonus fruit items are no longer static but now move randomly around the mazes. [CR]Ms Pac-Man features four different maze layouts, which alternate every two to four rounds : [CR]The first maze is only encountered in Rounds 1 and 2, and has 220 dots and 4 Power Pills. There are two sets of tunnels in this maze equidistant from the center of the maze. You must clear this maze two times before moving on to the next maze. [CR]The second maze is only encountered in Rounds 3, 4, and 5, and has 240 dots and 4 Power Pills. There are two sets of tunnels in this maze; one set in the lower half, and the other set at the very top. You must clear this maze three times before moving on to the next maze. [CR]The third maze is first encountered in Round 6 and has 238 dots and 4 Power Pills. Unlike all other mazes, there is only one set of tunnels in this maze, slightly above the center of the board. You must clear this maze four times before moving on to the next maze. [CR]The fourth and final unique maze is first encountered in Round 10 and has 234 dots and 4 Power Pills. There are two sets of tunnels in this maze, directly next to one another in the middle of the maze. The turns at the entrance to the tunnels change the usual immediate accessibility of the tunnels and should be taken in to account. You must clear this maze four times before moving on to the next maze. [CR]After Round 13, the game alternates every four rounds between the third and fourth mazes. [CR]Finally, the ghosts' movement patterns are also completely different from those of the original game. [CR]As in the original game, intermission scenes will be played after certain rounds. Ms. Pac-Man's intermissions tell the story of how Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man met, fell in love, and had a baby. Ms. Pac-Man's intermissions are also preceded by a sign and a title. 3 intermissions are present : [CR]1) Act I - They Meet : Pac-Man, the star of the original game, enters the screen being chased by Inky while Ms. Pac-Man enters from the other side being chased by Pinky. As the two of them are about to collide, they quickly move upwards, causing Inky and Pinky to collide. Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man face each other at the top of the screen, and a heart appears above them. This intermission is played after Round 2. [CR]2) Act II - The Chase : Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man are seen giving each other a playful chase. One chases the other in one direction, and they take turns alternating who chases who and in what direction. After three turns, they chase each other twice more at a faster speed. This intermission is played after Round 5. [CR]3) Act III - Junior : Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man anxiously await the arrival of a stork, who flies overhead with a bundle. As the stork is about to pass over them, he releases the bundle, which drops to the ground in front of Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man, and opens up to reveal a baby Pac. This intermission, which is played after Rounds 9, 13, and 17, would later serve as the introductory sequence to "Jr. Pac-Man". [CR]No intermission is present between rounds after the 18th one.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR][Upright model] [CR][No. 595] [CR]The upright model came in the standard Namco/Midway cabinet. This is the same 'swoopy' cabinet that "Galaxian", "Galaga", and "Pac-Man" came in as well. These featured painted side-art of Ms. Pac-Man and the ghosts, along with some pink accent lines. The last 10, 000 or so Ms. Pac-Man machines to roll off the assembly line had sticker side-art instead, it was the same basic scene, but the colors were brighter, and there were a few minor differences in the layout of the graphics. The marquee showed an image of Ms. Pac-Man lounging on her own logo, with a ghost off to the side. The exact colors used on the marquee varied a bit over the production run (as did the paint codes used on the side). The control panel and monitor bezel had a single design that covered both of them, that of a blue background with a pink or maroon stripe going around it, with a few game instructions printed upon them. [CR]Main CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 3.072 Mhz) [CR]Sound Chips : Namco 3-channel WSG (@ 96 Khz)  [CR]Players : 2 [CR]Control : 4-way joystick[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Having won their enhancement kit lawsuit against Atari, General Computing went to Bally Midway and showed them an enhancement kit that they were working on for Pac-Man called Crazy Otto. Crazy Otto was a character similar to Pac-Man with the exception that he had legs. GCC was going to bluff Midway into letting them release their enhancement kit by telling them that they won their lawsuit against Atari, and that they just wanted Midway's blessing. Midway suggested that they create a sequel to the original Pac-Man instead of an enhancement kit, and GCC got to work on Ms. Pac-Man. Ms. Pac-Man had two prior names before settling on the one that everyone knows. 'Mrs. Pac-Man' was the original, but some of the women employees at Midway had a problem with that, so it was changed to 'Miss Pac-Man'. When someone pointed out the third intermission, where Pac and Ms. Pac welcome "Jr. Pac-Man" (or Baby Pac-Man) into the fold, they changed it to the final name of 'Ms. Pac-Man'. Midway released "Baby Pac-Man" as a pinball/video hybrid, and General Computing sued the company, claiming they had created the concept of a Pac Family. They won the suit and were awarded royalties from Pac Family merchandise. [CR]The logo for General Computer Corporation is present among the graphics, probably a leftover from the game's days as Crazy Otto.[CR]In its initial run, 110,000 units were produced in the U.S. making it the best selling domestic arcade video game of all time. [CR]The game added a few improvements over the original : [CR]* Non-deterministic artificial intelligence for the ghosts, making it harder for enthusiasts to follow set patterns through levels. [CR]* A variety of different mazes used through the game. [CR]* Bonus items (such as cherries and pretzels) entered the maze and bounced through it, rather than appear in a set location as in the original, making the player go out of his way to attain it. [CR]* Brand new sound effects, including a new 'death' sound and opening theme. [CR]It was also one of the more successful of early arcade games in the female demographic, which has been attributed to 'Ms. Pac-Man' being a girl - although the Ms. Pac-Man sprite was little more than "Pac-Man" with eyelashes, a bow, lipstick and a dimple. [CR]After the 255th level, the maze (including dots) disappears. The game becomes unplayable, since there are no more dots to eat. [CR]Chris Ayra holds the record for this game on 'Regular' settings with 920,310 points on August 16, 1998. [CR]Victor Kunisada holds the record for this game on 'Speed-Up' settings with 922,810 points on June 16, 2001. [CR]Vancouver, Canada (Reuters) - Little 7-year old Al Nagac attained the Guinness World Record for Ms. Pac-Man v.2.97 with a score of 18,976,048. Al was exhausted and dehydrated and asked for several glasses of skim milk after shattering the longtime record of 11,056,736 set by Faith DeRivera, who was onhand to congratulate the victor with a kiss on the cheek. [CR]A Ms. Pac-Man unit appears in the 1983 movie 'WarGames', in the 1983 movie 'Joysticks', in the 1984 movie 'Tightrope' (the cab appears in the background of the bar scene), in the 1990 movie 'The Grifters', in the 1999 movie 'Man In The Moon' and in the 2002 movie 'Van Wilder'. [CR]Milton Bradley (MB) released a board game based on this video game in 1983. Up to 4 players can play. The maze is divided into four colored areas, representing each player; the object of the game is to clear all the dots in your colored area. Only one player at a time controls Ms. Pac-Man; the other players control the ghosts. Once a ghost catches Ms. Pac-Man, the player controlling that ghost takes over control of Ms. Pac-Man. [CR]Michael Jackson used to own this game (Midway upright). It was sold at the official Michael Jackson Auction on April 24th, 2009.[CR][B]Scoring[/B][CR]Dot : 10 points [CR]Power pill (energizer) : 50 points [CR]Ghosts : 200, 400, 800, 1,600 points [CR]Cherry : 100 points [CR]Strawberry : 200 points [CR]Peach : 500 points [CR]Pretzel : 700 points [CR]Apple : 1,000 points [CR]Pear : 2,000 points [CR]Banana : 5,000 points[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* The most dangerous section of the first maze is the long path at the very top. It is safest to clear it when the ghosts are blue, or at least 3 of them occupy the bottom half of the maze. [CR]* There are a couple of dangerous sections in the second maze. The pathways above and below the T section at the top of the maze can be particularly easy to get trapped in. It is easiest to clear these when all 4 ghosts are close on your tail, or after eating one of the top two power pellets. The two sections directly above the lower escape tunnels on either side should also be cleared with caution. [CR]* The most dangerous section of the 3rd maze is the center of the bottom, directly below where you begin. It is advisable to clear it out as early as possible before the ghosts can organize and trap you. The top section of the maze presents the ghosts with many pathways to reach you, so use caution. [CR]* The most dangerous sections of the 4th maze is the section that you begin in, and the section directly above the ghosts' den. The very top section of the maze should also be cleared with caution. [CR]* Secret Message : the message 'GENERAL COMPUTER CORPORATION Hello, Nakamura!' is buried at the end of the Ms. Pac-Man ROM image (Masaya Nakamura was head of Namco). [CR]* There's a fairly well-known glitch in the game - if you put a coin in when the Ms. Pac-Man marquee title first appears but before Blinky appears then the first board will be blue instead of pink and will remain blue until you either finish the board or lose a life, after which the board will return to its normal color.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

		<plot>Galaga (c) 1981 Namco. [CR]Galaga is a single-screen shoot-em-up in which the player controls a 'Fighter' spaceship and must defend the home planet against the on-coming hordes of alien invaders called "Galagans". The Fighter can only move left and right along the bottom of the screen. [CR]Galagans fly onto the screen in a variety of formations before forming troop lines at the top of the screen. Once all troop lines are formed the Galagans separate and start attacking the player's Fighter in ones, twos and threes. The top-line Boss Galaga need to be shot twice before they are destroyed. [CR]The Boss Galaga has a tractor beam that can capture the player's Fighter. A captured Fighter changes color from white to red and stays with that particular Boss until it is destroyed. The Fighter can be retrieved by destroying the Boss that captured it, but players must be careful not to destroy the captured Fighter itself, or that Fighter is lost. A rescued Fighter changes color back to white and links up with the player's current Fighter, doubling its fire power. [CR]As players progress through each screen, the speed and number of alien attacks increases. Alien formations also become more complex, making the aliens harder to shoot. [CR]Bonus Fighters are awarded periodically throughout the game, as players reach specific point values, as dictated by the 'Bonus Life' dip switch setting. Each enemy ship also has an assigned point value (see Scoring below). [CR]The alien troop lines that form at the top of the screen are, from top to bottom: Boss Galaga (in one row of four), Butterflies (red/white bug ships, in two rows of eight, directly below the Boss Galaga), and Bees (blue/yellow bug ships, in two rows of ten, directly below the Butterflies). [CR]In Stage 1, the enemies do not drop bombs as they fly onto the screen. However, they do so in most of the later stages. [CR]From Stage 4 onwards, a squadron of special bonus enemies called "transforms" start appearing. They're called transforms because Bees will begin pulsating and move out of formation to change into these bonus enemies. They appear in the form of yellow scorpions in Stages 4, 5, and 6, green 'Spy Ships' from "Bosconian" in Stages 8, 9, and 10, and Galaxian Flagships in Stages 12, 13, and 14. After that, the three different transforms are repeated in the same order. Transforms are always worthwhile targets because they are not very aggressive and are worth more than the other enemies. If all three transforms are destroyed, extra bonus points will be awarded. [CR]Galaga also features CHALLENGING STAGES, these consist of 40 Galagans that fly onto the screen in formations but do not drop any bombs. The object is to shoot as many of them as possible before they leave the play area. When an entire formation of eight Galagans is destroyed, bonus points are added to the player's score. If all 40 aliens are destroyed, players are awarded a special bonus of 10,000 points. [CR]Two new gameplay features Galaga introduced are : [CR]1) Players are given the chance to double their fire power. [CR]2) The game has a rapid fire (automatic firing) option, whereby the player simply holds the FIRE button down and the space fighter continues to fire at the Galagan army in bursts of two missiles each.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR][Upright model][CR]Game ID : GG[CR]Main CPU : Zilog Z80 (x3), MB88xx[CR]Sound Chips : Namco 3-channel WSG, discrete circuitry (for the ship explosion sound)[CR]Palette colors : 32 (16 colors for tiles + 16 colors for sprites)[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 2-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 1 (FIRE)[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Galaga was released in September 1981 in Japan.[CR]Although Galaga was a superior game, it didn't sell the large numbers that "Galaxian" did. One of the first games with a bonus stage. [CR]The game 'rolls over' at 999,990 points. The 1P score counter is six digits, but the 2P counter is seven digits. Therefore, most good players start a 2-player game and play exclusively on the 2P side so their score won't 'roll over' at 999,990. After the 1,000,000 mark, new Fighters are no longer awarded. [CR]What happens after finishing Stage 255 depends upon the skill level set in the DIP switches: [CR]* On the easy skill, the game resets. [CR]* On the medium skill, the game flips to "Stage 0" which plays as a strange cross between the 2nd Challenging Stage and a regular level where the enemies shoot. The game will advance to Stage 1 after completion, and the game will get easy again. [CR]* On the hard skill setting, the words "Stage 0" stay on the screen forever. No more enemies ever appear. The player can continue to move the ship and fire, but there is no way to advance to the next level, or to die. To play again, the machine must be reset. [CR]* On the hardest skill, the game flips to "Stage 0" which plays like Stage 1 (no extra enemies when flying onto the screen), but it is still as difficult as Stage 255. The game will advance to Stage 1 after completion, and the game will get easy again. [CR]If you have more than seven extra Fighters, the marker for the screen will only show 7 1/2 (!)

[CR]A Galaga unit appears in the 1983 movie 'WarGames', the 1983 movie 'Spring Break' (being played by one of the main characters), the 1984 movie 'The Karate Kid,' the 1987 movie 'Planes, Trains and Automobiles', and the sitcom 'Two and a Half Men', Season 5, Episode 2 (People Who Love Peepholes), and was shown in 2012 movie 'The Avengers' (a agent soldier was surprised playing in the Helicarrier computer).[CR][B]Scoring[/B][CR]Bee : 50 points in formation or 100 points in flight.[CR]Butterfly : 80 points in formation or 160 points in flight.[CR]Boss Galaga : 150 points in formation or 400 points in flight.[CR]Boss Galaga : 800 points in flight with 1 wingman.[CR]Boss Galaga : 1,600 points in flight with 2 wingmen.[CR]Scorpions : 160 points each, 1,000 points for destroying all 3.[CR]Bosconian Spy Ships : 160 points each, 2,000 points for destroying all 3.[CR]Galaxian Flagships : 160 points each, 3,000 points for destroying all 3.[CR]Captured fighter : 500 points in formation or 1000 points in flight.[CR]Challenging Stage : 100 points per ship destroyed if less than 40.[CR]Challenging Stage : 10,000 points for destroying all 40 ships (Perfect).[CR]Challenging Stage : 1,000 points on the first two Challenging Stages, 1,500 points on the 3rd and 4th, 2,000 points on the 5th and 6th, and 3,000 points from the 7th onward for destroying a complete formation of 8 ships.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Enemy Stop Shooting : on the first stage, kill everything but the two Bees in the bottom left corner. Then just wait, dodging the enemies' shots, until the enemy no longer drops any shots towards you. After the enemies stop firing, let them pass for two more trips and then kill them. For the rest of the game, the enemies will not drop shots. It will take approximately 15 minutes for the enemies to quit shooting at you, so this trick requires a lot of patience. Note : in a 2-player game, only one person has to do the cheat for both players to benefit. But as soon as one of the player's game is over the enemies begin shooting again.[CR]* (BUG) Take The Control Of The Fighter For Free : during the Galaga demo, the Boss Galaga comes down and tries to tractor-beam the Fighter. As soon as that tractor-beam starts, the player can take control of the ship in the demo. The player has two choices here and this will effect how the game handles this bug : If the player allows himself to be captured, the demo will continue as normal and he has the option of controlling the player Fighter or not. The player can choose whether to save the captured Fighter, try to complete the level, etc. The demo mode will complete after 30 seconds and the high-score screen will appear. If the player takes control of the Fighter and destroys the Boss Galaga with the tractor beam, some of the characters on the screen will freeze while others are still moving and doing what they are suppose to be doing. This will last 15-20 seconds, then the game will go to the high score screen.[CR]* Challenging stages are easier if the high score numbers are used to refine your aim. These tips assume a 6-digit high score :[CR]1) On the first two challenging stages, aim your ships so that your left set of bullets falls between the second and third numbers in the high score list.[CR]2) On subsequent challenging stages, aim one set of your bullets between the first and second numbers in the high score list (if the units come from the left) or between the last and next-to-last numbers (if the units come from the right). This will allow you to hit descending enemies at the highest possible point.[CR]* Here is a neat (and useless) Galaga trick : It is possible to end the game with a 200% ratio. The 200% hit-miss ratio trick can only be done with your first shot of the game. When the game starts, don't move, and fire only one shot. If you time it correctly, two enemies will be killed at once. Let your remaining Fighters be destroyed, and presto : a better-than-perfect result.[CR]* Easter Egg :[CR]1) Enter service mode.[CR]2) Keep B1 pressed and enter the following sequence : Right(x5), Left(x6), Right(x3), Left(x7). '(c) 1981 NAMCO LTD.' will be added at the bottom of the screen.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1. Galaxian (1979)[CR]2. Galaga (1981)[CR]3. Gaplus (1984) : also known in the USA as "Galaga 3"[CR]4.

		<plot>Spy Hunter (c) 1983 Bally Midway Mfg. Co.[CR]Spy Hunter is an action/driving game. It places the player as the driver of a G-6155 CIA Prototype Interceptor sports car. The object of the game is to travel the freeways and waterways, hunting down and destroying as many enemy vehicles as possible, all the while not harming civilian vehicles. The view is top-down and the screen scrolls vertically underneath the player's car.[CR]The game begins with the player driving the G-6155. Soon, the player starts to encounter enemy vehicles which try to force the player's car off the road and crash. Each enemy vehicle has its own special feature, such as tire slashers or bulletproof armor.[CR]Points are scored for driving on the road and for destroying enemy vehicles. There is a lead-in time when the player has an endless supply of cars. After this time expires, the player will lose a life each time the car crashes. Extra cars can be earned with high scores. The first extra car is earned at a default value of 30,000 points, but this value can vary depending on settings.[CR]The player must be careful to avoid harming civilian vehicles on the road. There are three types: blue automobiles, pink automobiles, and motorcycles. Hurting these vehicles causes scoring to stop briefly, during which time the player's score reads 'NO POINTS'.[CR]Initially, the only weapon the player's car has available is a dual front-mounted machine gun which has an endless supply of ammunition. Early on, these guns and the player's driving skill are his only weapons against the enemy cars. The player can also attempt to force or ram the enemy cars off the road. Eventually the player encounters an ally, the weapons van. After the player drives past the weapons van parked on the side of the road, the van accelerates past the player's car and positions itself in front of it and drops a ramp. The player can then drive up the ramp to enter the back of the van. The van then pulls to the side of the road and deploys the spy car equipped with a new weapon. A symbol atop the weapons van indicates which type of special weapon it carries. The player is not obligated to use the weapons supplied by the van. Also, if uninterested, the player can simply ignore the van and drive past it.[CR]There are three special weapons in all and they can all be equipped simultaneously. The special weapons consist of an oil slick, a smoke screen and missiles. Each special weapon has a limited number of uses. The smoke screen and missiles can each be used three times. The special weapons are activated via dedicated buttons on the steering wheel. Once the weapons ammo is depleted or before, the car can be refitted with a new supply from the weapons van.[CR]There are six enemies in all, each with their own special characteristic : [CR]* 'Switchblade' or 'Never To Be Trusted' cars have tire slashers. Knives pop out of this car's tires and can force the player's car to crash if they touch his tires.[CR]* 'The Road Lord' or 'Bulletproof Bully' cars have bulletproof armor plating; machine guns are ineffective against these cars.[CR]* 'The Enforcer' or 'Double Barrel Action' is a limousine with a shotgun-toting thug who shoots at the player's car.[CR]* 'The Mad Bomber' or 'Master Of The Sky' is a helicopter which drops bombs. This enemy can only be destroyed with missiles.[CR]* 'Barrel Dumper' is a boat which drops lethal explosives into the water.[CR]* 'Doctor Torpedo' is a boat which shoots torpedoes at the player's ship.[CR]Occasionally a message appears on screen that says 'Bridge Out - Detour on Left'. Then the player must drive his car into a boathouse located alongside the road, otherwise he will crash into the water and lose a life. After driving through this house, the player's car is turned into a speedboat on a river, with enemy boats which try to destroy the player. In this area, if the player uses the oil slick, the boat instead issues a line of fire which destroys any ship directly behind the player. In this area, occasionally the river splits; the left side continues the river, the right side causes the player to drive through another house where the boat is changed back into the car.[CR]Later in the game the player gets a warning that there are 'Icy Roads Ahead', then the player enters an area that has a white road which is very slick. The icy roads section eventually ends and goes back to normal roads. Icy roads occur again on and off during the rest of the game.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR][Game No. A27][CR][Upright model][CR]Bally Midway MCR 3 hardware[CR]Main CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 5 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 2 Mhz), 68000 (@ 7.5 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : (2x) General Instrument AY8910 (@ 2 Mhz), DAC (@ 2 Mhz)[CR]Screen orientation : Vertical[CR]Video resolution : 480 x 480 pixels[CR]Screen refresh : 30.00 Hz[CR]Palette colors : 68[CR]Players : 1[CR]Control : Steering wheel with gear shift and pedal (High/Low)[CR]Buttons : 5[CR]=&gt; MACHINE GUNS, SMOKE SCREEN, OIL SLICK, MISSILES, WEAPONS VAN[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Spy Hunter was released in November 1983.[CR]Originally the James Bond theme was planned as the background music for the game. The inability to obtain the rights to use the music, however, forced Midway to change the theme on shipping models. In the end, the Peter Gunn theme music was a large part of the game's appeal.[CR]A boat driving sequence is incorporated in the game, and a sequence with the player flying a helicopter was also planned. Shortage of memory, however, did not allow for this feature. The game was RUMORED to have an ending sequence where the player exited the car for on-foot action in a graveyard scene, however this is a fantasy; the game has no end and at no time does the driver ever leave the car or boat.[CR]The car was based on one of the designer's own Nissan 280z. The name of the car, the G-6155, is a clever tribute to designer George Gomez - the numbers stand for his birth date.[CR]From George Gomez : 'My original design for both upright and sit-down were identical. And they were produced that way only because of the economies of manufacturing. Which means : why make different parts, since it will cost less to make more of one design. "Spy Hunter II" which I had nothing to do with was different. On my game both left and right grips should each have a trigger and a thumb button, in addition to the center button (call weapons van). The shifter was a two-position device, low and high. Of course there was the gas pedal and a series of dashboard weapons lights for machine guns, missiles, oil slick and smoke. After the first few thousand games the grips were retooled in plastic and they went on to be used in hundreds of different games. They were licensed to Happ controls in the late 80's and they have been on almost every manufacturer's games at one point or another. The original sand cast aluminium grips (painted black) were actually molded directly from patterns that I carved and they had softer contours and were more comfortable but they were also very expensive. So to cost-reduce them, the company took the grips and retooled them to be injection molded plastic. However, the patterns for the plastic grips were made off the engineering drawings, and the drawings of that era were not as representative of the actual parts I carved, since they were made after my patterns instead of before. I have the original wood patterns along with some other stuff from development of the game in a box somewhere.' [CR]Spy Hunter was parodied in a sketch in the television show 'Robot Chicken'.[CR]In 2008, a Pontiac Commercial featured an homage to Spy Hunter by showing some gameplay which had the player's car turn into a real Pontiac.[CR][B]Scoring[/B][CR]The Road Lord : 150 points[CR]Switch Blade : 150 points[CR]The Enforcer : 500 points[CR]The Mad Bomber : 700 points[CR]Barrel Dumper : 150 points[CR]Doctor Torpedo : 500 points[CR]Driving through the river boathouse : 1,500 points[CR]Driving on the road for each 1/4 screen traveled : 15 points[CR]Driving on the water for each 1/4 screen traveled : 25 points[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Here's A Great Cheat That Does Several Things At Once:[CR]1) You need to have a supply truck available, and be at a bridge-out level. When the detour appears, don't take it - instead, call up your truck.[CR]2) Wait until the road has straightened out into the bridge and drive into the truck. When the truck pulls over and lets you out, stay on the side of the road, and SLOWLY drive up until you reach the gap in the bridge.[CR]3) Drive on until you car is about half-way over the edge, and wait until the Enforcer comes along. He will try and get you, but he'll be unable to drive far enough to do so. At this point, I would get a friend to mind the game, while I went for a break. When I returned, I just drove across the bridge, flying mysteriously across the bridge out, until I reached the other side.[CR]4) You will notice several differences to the game after this happens. The Enforcer no longer appears, the game gets no harder, and Dr. Torpedo no longer appears on water sections![CR]* Switchblade Destruction: You can actually destroy the Switchblade cars without use of weapons. As they close in from the rear, slow down a hair and align your car so that their front bumper is just barely in line with your Rear Bumper. Then Quickly slam the wheel to bump them off the road. As long as you bump them before the front tire area, the blades will not harm you.[CR]* Exploding Van Trick: When the Weapons Van comes, start to drive into it, but shoot a single bullet just before you enter. If you time it right, your car will still enter the yet unharmed Van, give you the weapon, let you out... then it will explode.[CR]* Boat Jumps: In an homage to a famous scene in the James Bond film "Live and Let Die", it is possible to jump the spy boat completely over an island. When you're on the water, an island will appear shortly after you miss an opportunity to exit the river. To make the jump, you must be at or near the vehicle's top speed and simply drive right at the island. If you're closely followed at the time, your pursuers won't make the jump.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1. &lt;a href="index.php?page=database&amp;listtypes=1&amp;lemot=spy%20hunter%20%5Bno"&gt;Spy Hunter&lt;/a&gt; (1983, Arcade)[CR]2.

		<plot>Tron (c) 1982 Bally Midway.[CR]Tron is a 1- or 2-player game set inside the 'Tron' computer, and is based on the ground-breaking Disney movie of the same name.[CR]Tron consists of twenty-two stages - or 'phases' - of play. Each phase consists of four separate games called "domains", all of which must be completed before moving on to the next phase. Players can determine the order in which each of the four domains is attempted, but the domain position is random and is only revealed once that domain has been chosen.[CR]The four domains that make up a phase never change throughout the game, although both the difficulty level and number of enemies increases with each subsequent phase. The domains are as follows:[CR]* LIGHT CYCLES : The player controls a Light Cycle that leaves a blue light trail in its wake. The aim is to 'box in' the yellow enemy Light Cycles, making them crash into either a cycle trail (theirs or the player's) or a wall. The player must also avoid any collision with either walls or light trails. The joystick controls the direction of the bike and the trigger controls its speed.[CR]* I/O TOWER : Destroy the Grid Bugs that emerge from the grid surrounding the tower. The bugs will multiply and fill the entire screen if not stopped. Players must attempt to clear a path to - and enter - the I/O Tower before the timer runs out. The stick controls the movement of the player's character and the spinner controls the direction of fire.[CR]* TANK MAZE : Destroy all enemy tanks that are patrolling the maze. The player's tank can fire in all directions and can bounce shots off walls, but can be destroyed by a single shot; while enemy tanks can only fire in the direction of travel but need three shots before they are destroyed. "Recognizer" tanks also feature in later phases; these Do NOT shoot but move quickly and will try to ram the player's tank. The joystick controls the movement of the player's tank and the spinner controls the direction of fire.[CR]* MCP CONE : Destroy the blocks in the descending, rotating coloured column to clear a path and move the character up into the light cone above the blocks. A bonus is awarded if all of the blocks are destroyed. The stick controls the movement of the character and the spinner controls the direction of fire.[CR]Bonus lives are awarded periodically throughout the game as specific point scores are reached. Each enemy and item has an assigned point value (see the "SCORING" section for details).[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR][Game No. 628][CR][Upright model][CR]Bally Midway MCR 2 hardware[CR]Main CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 2.496 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 2 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : (2x) General Instrument AY8910 (@ 2 Mhz)[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-way 'flight yolk' controller with a trigger, spinner knob[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Tron was released in May 1982.[CR]When Bally/Midway signed a deal to create a Tron video game, they were very pressed for time and needed a game quickly. They decided to let all 3 of their design teams (their in-house team, Dave Nutting Associates, and Arcade Engineering) take a crack at a prototype. The Dave Nutting Associates team (led by Dave Armstrong) proposed a 3-D color vector game that was deemed too complex and expensive, thought it was later developed into a prototype called "Earth, Friend, Mission". The internal team eventually won the right to produce the game. The initial design document called for 6 different mini-games :[CR]1) Rings (a light-disk duel between Tron and Sark).[CR]2) Paranoia (in which the player builds a bridge of spiders to reach an island).[CR]3) Tank Pursuit[CR]4) Space Spores[CR]5) I/O Tower (the player tries to reach an energy socket while avoiding electrifying blue warriors)[CR]6) Light Cycles.[CR]Fearing that they would never get the game out in time, the Rings game was made into a separate game and the Paranoia and I/O Tower game was dropped (though the MCP Cone sequence was later added). At one point the film included deadly spores that were included in the game's Grid Bug sequence, but when they were removed from the movie, they had to be removed from the game as well.[CR]To promote the game, Bally/Midway and Alladin's Castle sponsored a seven-week-long tournament at over 400 locations throughout the country, as well as a celebrity tournament.[CR]Most of the levels correspond to a computer language. Of course, some literary license was used for the level names and a couple of them don't really make sense. Anyway, here are the 11 level names and what they are :[CR]ALGOL : Algorithmic Language. Influenced the development of more modern language (along with FORTRAN and LISP). Used for number crunching.[CR]ASSEMBLY : Machine language. Used to write code directly to the computer without having to compile or interpret it.[CR]BASIC : Beginners All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code. Used primarily for teaching rudimentary programming.[CR]COBOL : Common Business Oriented Language. Used primarily for accounting. Very old language.[CR]FORTRAN : Formula Translator. Used for processing numbers and/or formulas.[CR]JCL : Job Control Language. Used on IBM mainframes to execute specific jobs and scripts on the Job Entry Subsystem.[CR]OS : Precursor language to OS2.[CR]PASCAL : Teaching language for compiled languages. Not very powerful.[CR]PL1 : A play on the actual language called PLI. Language used for solving mathematical problems.[CR]RPG : Report Program Generator. Use for generating reports. Usually used with COBOL.[CR]SNOBOL : Used for character string manipulation.[CR]Walt Disney Productions sued Williams Electronics for copyright and patent infringement over Williams' use of the name 'tron' in their arcade legend, "Robotron - 2084". Common sense prevailed, however, and Williams won the suit.[CR]The game's sequel, "Discs of Tron" was originally intended to be a part of the original game but tight time constraints meant that the mini-game was not completed in time.[CR]A Tron unit appears in the 1983 movie, 'War Games', in the 1986 movie 'The Color of Money' and in the 1987 movie, 'Death Wish 4 - The Crackdown'.[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]OLDER VERSION (clone 6/15 in Mame) :[CR]* Level 1 (RPG) gives you 1000 on the timer instead of 500 in the I/O Tower game, making it easier to get the 1000 point bonus for killing all grid bugs in Level 1.[CR]* The series of sounds that play when blocks are destroyed in the MCP Cone game are higher in pitch than in the other versions of Tron.[CR]* Each phase features different pattern schemes from the other versions - Play Level 2 (COBOL) in the other version, and then play Level 2 in the (6/15) version, keeping the Game Difficulty setting at the default (5) each time, and you'll see what we mean.[CR][B]Scoring[/B][CR]Scoring in this game is relatively easy since there aren't a lot of enemies to keep track of.[CR]Grid Bugs : 50 points[CR]Bit : 5000 points[CR]Blocks : 25 points[CR]Light Cycles : 500 points[CR]Tanks...[CR]1st Hit : 100 points[CR]2nd Hit : 300 points[CR]3rd Hit : 500 points[CR]You get a 1000 point bonus for destroying all the Grid Bugs.[CR]You get the remaining time added to your score when you enter the I/O Tower.[CR]NOTE : On Level 1 (RPG), you only get 500 on the timer. On all other levels, you get 1000 on the timer. EXCEPTION : As stated in the "Updates" section above, if you're playing the (6/15) version, you always get 1000 on the timer, even on Level 1.[CR]You get a 1000 point bonus for destroying all the Blocks.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]When you start the game, you will have a cursor in the middle of a computer-looking grid. You have 8 seconds to go one of 4 directions on that grid. If you don't, you will be randomly sent in a direction. Once you have completed an area, you can no longer go to that area until you get to the next level. The areas are randomized on this computer grid so you won't know what you will get next. Below are the four areas and strategies to get through them.[CR]* I/O TOWER : This is one of the easier areas to get through. It just involves a lot of shooting.[CR]- Quickly establish where the Grid Bugs are. That way you can quickly aim to clear out a path if necessary.[CR]- The game simulation sailor comes out at random times and drops the Bit off. Do everything you can to get to it for a free 5,000 points.[CR]- Work your way to one of the exits and 'camp out'. Just use the spinner to aim high and low to take care of the Grid Bugs. Once the timer hits 100, go ahead and exit the screen.[CR]- It is possible to get over 10,000 points in this area alone (5,000 for the Bit and over 5,000 for Grid Bugs killed).[CR]- On the earlier levels, try to take out all of the Grid Bugs for the 1,000 point bonus.[CR]* LIGHT CYCLES : This is one of the harder areas until you learn the patterns. Then it will become a breeze.[CR]- The arena for this game is a 9 x 9 grid. Use the grid lines to gauge distances and to also know where the turns are.[CR]- Hitting the wall, your light trail, or an enemy light trail will end your cycling career very quickly.[CR]- Depending on the machine set up, you will need to identify different patterns and make the appropriate adjustments to your strategy. Make sure you are staying at full speed until the enemy light cycles are trapped.[CR]- Usually you can adjust when you see enemy cycles coming after you. A lot of times they will follow another cycle into the wall or a light trail. The enemy cycles become much quicker after level 10.[CR]- If the three light cycles are coming straight down, go right and up around them. Then do a rectangle pattern leaving an opening to the right side to allow the enemy cycles to crash against the wall.[CR]- Use the above pattern if the middle or right cycles go straight (the other ones will veer around before they head down).[CR]- For any other occasion, it's best to go left and make a box that way. Again, the enemy cycles will destroy themselves before you get into trouble.[CR]* MCP CONE : Another easier area.  Even if you mess up a little, you can still recover from your mistake.[CR]- First, determine the cone's speed and direction of travel. You can accomplish the second thing by shooting at it to determine which way the hole travels.[CR]- Next, determine your speed. This will determine how much time you have to blow through the cone to get to the exit.[CR]- Once you have determined the above, go over to the side that the cone is entering from. For example, if the cone is moving from left to right, the go over to the left side and start shooting.[CR]- The 4 block cones are pretty easy. Just rapidly blast a path and go up.[CR]- The 6 block cones are a little trickier. You will need to open up the bottom part of the cone. Enter this new opening and start to chew at the top. You will end up having blocks rotate below you as you head up. Be careful and watch around you since you will end up surrounded by blocks before you enter the exit.[CR]- The hardest cone to get through is when Tron is travelling fast and the cone is moving slow. You have to quickly blast a path any way you can or you will collide with the cone.[CR]- For extra points, you can position yourself half-way out of the exit and blast at the top blocks. On the earlier levels, try to get the 1,000 point bonus.[CR]* TANKS : Probably the hardest area of the game. You have to learn how to move and shoot (in different directions) at the same time.[CR]- It takes 3 hits to destroy an enemy tank. You have the advantage, though, by being able to use rapid fire and bouncing your shots off the walls. Enemy tanks can only have one shot out a time.[CR]- This rebounding of shots can be a very effective offensive measure. You may be able to hit tanks from afar or hit them around corners just by rebounding your shots just right. Prevent them from getting close.[CR]- The pink teleporter area is the key to surviving many of the tank patterns. Just don't go too far in or you may end up teleporting to a hostile environment very quickly.[CR]- If you stay off the tank trails, enemy tanks will not fire on you. They can, however, ram your tank (this is especially true if you are hanging out in the teleportation area).[CR]- Like other parts of Tron, there are patterns you can use on the specific tank patterns to ensure your survival.[CR]* This is an interesting bug. On the MCP Cone levels, if you go all the way to the right or the left and keep moving, you can move the whole playfield to the side. This doesn't seem to have any other affect.[CR]* Here's an odd Tron bug : On the Recognizer Tank levels, make your way to one of the little alcoves in either the top right, or bottom left corners. The tanks cannot shoot, and will not go down an alcove, so therefore cannot kill you. Then, wait approximately 9 to 10 minutes without moving your tank. You can fire, but do not kill all the recognizers. After the time (9-10 mins), the sound system will go berzerk, starting with a very high pitch tone, which falls to a low tone that vibrates the cabinet. The sound also goes berzerk if you enter the tower at 0099 units on the bug screen.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1. Tron (1982)[CR]2. Discs of Tron (1983)[CR]3. Tron 2.0 (2003, PC/MAC) [CR]4.

		<plot>Elevator Action (c) 1983 Taito.[CR]Agent 17 (code name 'Otto') is to secure the top secret documents from the security building. The enemy spies are in pursuit and their orders are to stop him at any cost. Having made it to the top of a 30 story building, Agent 17 has to make his way down to the basement to get to the getaway car and save the documents. Enemy spies are everywhere and the documents are hidden behind the red doors (bonus points awarded). He has to open the door and keep moving. If either of them shoots the lights out there will be a temporary blackout. If Otto finds himself on top of the elevator the player will not be able to control the elevator. If he gets caught in the elevator he is a sitting duck and cannot duck the bullets. By using the escalator he can reach the basement quicker. Otto can defeat his enemy by jump kicking or firing at them. Help Otto to grab all the documents and escape the spies.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Elevator Action was available in 2 different arcade formats, a cocktail table and an upright dedicated cabinet. Both versions used the same internal hardware though.[CR]* The upright version came in the standard 'Taito Classic' cabinet, which was the same one used for Jungle Hunt, Zoo Keeper, Alpine Ski, and many others. These cabinets normally did not have side art that advertised the name of the game, instead they had a painted design of lines and shapes, along with a Taito logo. Different titles had different designs and color schemes, although they have been known to ship games in the wrong cabinets. But lets get back on track here. Elevator Action should come in a brown cabinet with a Taito logo up near the top. The marquee shows a scene of Agent 17 waiting for an elevator while an enemy agent shoots at him. While the monitor bezel shows agents on either side, has game instructions at the bottom, and shows an elevator floor display at the top. This bezel artwork is silk screened on glass, and is prone to peeling, be very careful if you have to handle one of these. The control panel has a single 4-Way ball-top joystick mounted centrally, with jump and fire buttons located to either side.[CR]Internally the machine uses a 19 inches open frame monitor mounted horizontally, and a set of game boards that conform to the 'Taito Classic' wiring standard. Many other early Taito games (such as "Jungle Hunt" and "Bubble Bobble") will plug directly into this cabinet without modification.[CR]* The cocktail version came in a table similar in design to the one used for Space Invaders and Carnival. It was not decorated except for a pair of instruction cards underneath the glass. Most Japanese game makers purchased their tables from the same few manufacturers, and were quite likely to change the exact model of cocktail that they shipped in mid production. So assume any Elevator Action cocktail is original unless it is obviously converted from another title.[CR]Runs on the "Taito SJ System" hardware.[CR]Prom Stickers : BA3 / EA[CR]Players: 2[CR]Control: 4-way joystick[CR]Buttons: 2 (FIRE, JUMP)[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Elevator Action was released in July 1983. [CR]G. Ben Carter, Jr. holds official the record for this game with 143,450 points.[CR][B]Scoring[/B][CR]Shooting an enemy agent : 100 points[CR]Jumping on an enemy agent : 150 points[CR]Dropping a light on an enemy agent : 300 points[CR]Getting a secret document : 500 points[CR]The bonus is 1,000 points x the level you are on. After 10th level, you will get 10,000 points per level completed.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* When you start the game, a quick animation will show a hook with a line connecting to the top of the elevator. Then your character will slide down the line to the roof. Then he will enter the building, in the elevator, at the 30th floor. It is now up to you to get all the secrets and make it to your car. The first thing you must know, obviously, is how to eliminate the enemy agents that are after you. There are a few ways you can do this :[CR]1) Just shoot them. Of course, especially in the later levels, enemy agents make themselves an impossible target by lying down. You can only take them out by riding an elevator down.[CR]2) Jumping on them will take care of them. In addition, you may avoid some of their fire.[CR]3) On the non-dark floors, shoot the light down on top of an enemy agent. You must do this from the elevator. This also has the added effect of causing temporary darkness in the building, making enemy agents harder to see.[CR]4) Crush an enemy agent using the elevator. This is hard to do since they move around. You may get lucky, however, and get one under or on top of the elevator you are on.[CR]5) This way is pretty hard. You might be able to get an enemy agent to follow you and fall down the hole created by the missing elevator.[CR]* You must know how to use the escalators and open the red doors :[CR]1) To use the escalators, just stand on the little rectangle. Then push the joystick UP or DOWN depending on which direction you need the escalator to take you.[CR]2) To open the red doors, stand on the little rectangle. Face the doorknob and press RIGHT on the joystick.[CR]* You have full control over any elevator you enter. This means you can move UP and DOWN on a dime to keep your character safe. This works until the alarm goes off.[CR]* Speaking of elevators, your character cannot duck while in an elevator. Also, while riding the escalators, your character cannot duck, jump, or fire his weapon.[CR]* Also on elevators, you do not have control when you are riding on top of them. This means you are at the mercy of the elevator or the enemy agent controlling it. Be very careful if you ride on top of the elevator. You also cannot go past the bar on the top of the elevator.[CR]* Enemy agents usually come out of the doors on the current floor or the floor above and below. A lot of times it is good to lay a wall of fire down a hallway. This way, you can pick off any enemy agents that happen to come out of one of the doors.[CR]* When you enter through one of the red doors, the enemy agents will lose track of your character but will have a general idea of where your character is. When you exit the room, crouch and lay down fire both left and right to clear off the floor.[CR]* As the levels progress, the enemy agents get better at their tactics. They start to crouch more to mess up your fire. They also may lay down which makes it impossible to hit them unless you are on an elevator and can shoot along the floor.[CR]* As you move up in levels, there will be red doors in odd areas. Areas such as on the lower five floors where only elevators can take you across. Of course, if you get good with the jump button, you can jump those gaps to get to either side quicker. The downside is that enemy agents will usually flood the area and lay down a lot of fire.[CR]* If you happen to get to the B1 floor and you have forgotten to get a red door, the game will automatically put your agent at the door you missed. If it is multiple doors, then you will be placed at the highest floor first.[CR]* There is an internal time limit on how long you can take to get everything out of the building. If you take too much time, an alarm sounds and the following things occur :[CR]a) Although you still have control over the elevators, it is much harder to get them to respond to your commands. If you are in a tight situation that requires a little bit of time, don't wait till the last minute or you may be an ex-agent.[CR]b) The enemy agents move much quicker and their shots move faster. Plus, additional enemy agents will start appearing to really make your life miserable.[CR]c) If your character happens to die, the next man will still be facing the same alarm situation. The only way to resolve the situation is to get all of the secrets and make it out of the building.[CR]* Watch out for the double elevator. If you are in the top car, it will stop two floors short of the bottom since there is a one floor gap, and the bottom car. Try to always get into the bottom car of a double elevator so that you can make a hasty exit and not be trapped with enemy agents firing on you.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

		<plot>Tapper (c) 1983 Bally Midway.[CR]Taking on the role of an overworked bartender, the player must serve beer to the ever-thirsty patrons that populate his bar. All customers must be served before they work their way up to the beer kegs. Empty glasses must also be collected before they slide off the end of the bar and smash to the floor. Extra points are awarded for collecting tips, while bonus rounds involve locating the one beer that has not been shaken, and serving it. The game features four different levels :[CR]1. Cowboys[CR]2.

The Suntory version was a Sega board, Suntory is a Japanese beer (see "Updates" section for more information).[CR]The main character in the game (as well as the main character of two other Bally Midway games; "Domino Man", and "Timber") is based on a Marvin Glass employee called Mike Ferris, who had the same distinctive mustache and bald head and reputedly wore a red T-shirt all of the time.[CR]The music for the third stage (the punk bar) was loosely inspired by new wave music group Devo's song 'Workin' in the Coal Mine'.[CR]Tapper was play tested in a Chicago-area Rush Streetbar called 'The Snuggery' and received much positive feedback from the bar's patrons. Digitized belches were originally going to be used in the game, but, perhaps thankfully, they never made it into the final version.[CR]The cabinet is designed to resemble a real bar - replete with a brass foot rail and two brass drink or ashtray holders (one on each side of the control panel). The cabinet and gameplay on the beer version features the Budweiser logo. The pour spouts have mock-up Budweiser handles that closely resemble the Budweiser taps that appear in real bars throughout the world.[CR]Approximately 3300 Tapper uprights were made and around the first 100 or so were released with colour side art. About 300 cocktail machines were also made.[CR]The main character appears on the 2012 Disney animated movie Wreck-It Ralph, during the Bar scene. It should also be noted that despite the game in the movie being Root Beer Tapper, the main character wore his outfit from the Budweiser version.[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]* Suntory version has different graphics and most likely different music.[CR][B]Scoring[/B][CR]Serving a cowboy/girl patron with beer : 50 points.[CR]Serving a sports bar patron with beer : 75 points.[CR]Serving a punk patron with beer : 100 points.[CR]Serving an alien patron with beer : 150 points.[CR]Collecting an empty beer glass : 100 points.[CR]Collecting a tip left on the bar : 1,500 points.[CR]Guessing the correct can on the bonus screen : 3,000 points.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Easter Egg : In the attract mode, wait until the word Tapper is filling up with beer, and hold down the joystick, both taps, and the player 1 &amp; 2 buttons.

		<plot>Mr. Do! (c) 1983 Universal.[CR]Mr. Do! is a colourful and addictive maze game in which the player takes on the role of the eponymous Mr. Do, a circus clown, who must clear each level of either cherries or monsters. The game's single screen levels are made up of tunnels surrounded by a colourful, soil-like substance. This soil can be dug through to create new tunnels, allowing Mr. Do to escape his enemies and to reach the many cherries that litter the levels. A number of apples are also scattered around each level, and Mr. Do can push them along tunnels (to block and/or kill monsters) or can tunnel beneath them to drop them onto the heads of any pursuing enemies. Mr. Do himself can also be killed by a falling apple.[CR]Mr. Do is armed with a 'Powerball' that can be fired down a tunnel, it will then bounce around the tunnels until it either returns to Mr. Do, or comes into contact with, and kills, one of the level's monsters. The Powerball regenerates immediately the first time you use it, but takes longer each time it is used to return to your hands. As each level progresses, the monsters themselves start to dig tunnels of their own in their pursuit of Mr. Do. Monsters can also push the apples.[CR]Each screen has a doorway through which the monsters enter the level. Once all of the monsters have appeared, the doorway will turn into a 'prize', (ice cream, biscuits, etc.). If Mr. Do collects the prize, the 'Alphamonster' and his three 'Muncher' henchmen will appear. The Alphamonster may be in the EXTRA box at the top of the screen or be moving around the screen. The Alphamonster and the Munchers cannot be easily crushed under apples because they tend to eat them. They can be killed individually with the Powerball or by killing the Alphamonster itself, at which point any remaining Munchers will turn into apples.[CR]After every three levels, there is a brief intermission in which a tune is played and a large, animated Mr. Do appears, together with some of the game's monsters. The time to complete each level and the preferred method (monsters, cherries, Alphamonsters, or Diamond) is shown. The paths in the first level resemble a 'D', after this each level's tunnels resemble a digit, ('2', '3', '4' etc.) up to '0' for level 10.[CR]A level can be completed any one of several different ways : either by collecting all of the on-screen cherries; by killing all of the monsters, by completing the EXTRA box, or by collecting the diamond. The latter appears only very occasionally ('Special' awards an extra credit).[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Prom Stickers : D1-D10[CR]Main CPU : Zilog Z80[CR]Sound Chips : (2x) Texas Instruments SN76496[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 4-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 1[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Mr. Do! was released in December 1982. It was also licensed to Taito.[CR]Mr. Do! was inspired by "Dig Dug" and was the first in a series of four Mr. Do! games. Mr. Do! was one of video-gaming's biggest arcade successes. Unfortunately for Universal, none of their other games could match it in commercial terms. [CR]It is the game responsible for launching the kit game craze in the U.S. video game industry.[CR]David Breckon holds the official record for this game with 26,030,050 points.[CR]A bootleg of this game is known as "Mr. Lo!", and another is called "Mr. Du!".[CR]There are several well-known hacks of Mr Do! which are as follows :[CR]* Mr. DigDo! - graphics changed to make them look more like those of Namco's "Dig Dug".[CR]* Mr. Jong - Changes the clown into an old Chinese man, the monsters into clowns and the apples into mahjong blocks.[CR]* Yankee Do! - Changes the graphics to make them more American patriotic.[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]On the Prototype version (which is a Japanese hack) :[CR]* You are a 'Yukidaruma' (a snowman) with green arms instead of the famous clown.[CR]* You dig with a rake in your hands.[CR]* There is a mean expression when you push an apple.[CR]* The screen does not turn red when you grab cookies, cake, etc...[CR][B]Scoring[/B][CR]Eating a cherry : 50 points.[CR]Eating a series of 8 cherries in a row : 500 points bonus.[CR]Killing a monster with your snowball : 500 points.[CR]Killing one monster with one apple : 1,000 points.[CR]Killing two monsters with one apple : 2,000 points.[CR]Killing three monsters with one apple : 4,000 points.[CR]Killing four monsters with one apple : 6,000 points.[CR]Killing five or more monsters with one apple : 8,000 points.[CR]Collecting special (free credit) diamond : 8,000 points.[CR]Collecting bonus treat from empty monster home: 1,000 points on level one, increasing incremently up to a maximum of 8,000 points on level 22 onwards.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* 255 Lives Tricks : It's possible to win 255 lives on the first screen, but only if an apple appears in the top two rows of the playfield.[CR]1) Begin by digging a tunnel directly from the bottom of the screen to just below the apple, but leave enough dirt under it that it doesn't fall.[CR]2) Next, kill all of the enemies but one, then lose all of your extra lives. As soon as you're on your last life, go right under the apple and wait.[CR]3) Eventually, the remaining enemy will come after you. Allow the apple to drop, but, in the interval before you're squashed, kill the enemy with the powerball. If all has gone well, you'll be carried to the bottom of the screen, the music will go haywire for a moment, and you'll be awarded 255 extra lives.[CR]4) Note that you should always lose a life before spelling 'EXTRA', or you'll roll back to zero lives, so, to be safe, immediately kill yourself at the start of level two.[CR]5) IMPORTANT : This trick will only work with the Taito version of Mr. Do!.[CR]* Here's A Neat Trick : You can divide the screen into a grid. The cherries, apples, and tunnel corners are all centered on a grid element. If you are being chased by the normal badguys (not ghosts) you can dig and stop between grid elements. The badguy will think it needs to turn into a digger to get you. While he's changing forms, you can escape.[CR]* An Alphamonster will appear every time your score reaches a multiple of 5,000.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1. Mr. Do! (1982)[CR]2.

		<plot>Tempest (c) 1981 Atari.[CR]Tempest is a classic into-the-screen shoot-em-up in which the player controls a claw-shaped "Blaster" ship that moves around the outer rim of a three-dimensional, wireframe tunnel. Enemies move down the tunnel towards the player's ship and must be destroyed. Any contact with either incoming enemy fire or the enemies themselves will cost the player a life. Completion of a tunnel will see the player warp through "hyperspace" to the next tunnel to tackle a new wave of enemies. [CR]The tunnels are each rendered in one of sixteen different geometric shapes. Enemies increase in number as the game progresses and if an enemy reaches the outer rim occupied by the player's Blaster ship, it will chase and attempt to kill the player. Rim enemies can be killed, but this is difficult to achieve. [CR]Some enemies also drag "spikes" - in the form of lines in the middle of the corridor - behind them as they travel up the tunnel towards the player. These spikes must be avoided during the "hyperspace" warp sequence at the end of the level, as contact results in the loss of a life. [CR]Two "SuperZappers" are available per level. The first SuperZapper kills all enemies on the playfield at the time of firing, while the second randomly kills only one enemy on the playfield. The SuperZapper does not affect enemy shots, spikes or enemies that have not yet landed on the playfield. [CR]One new feature Tempest introduces is "Skill-Step". This allows players to start a new game on the same level as was previously reached (although the new game must be restarted within thirty seconds) without having to replay previous levels. This allows skillful players to continue being challenged, while less experienced players can try to master higher levels. The 99 skill levels of play includes sixteen different playfields and seven different enemy targets. [CR]* The tubes are divided into cosmic corridors through which the aliens travel, although some aliens such as Pulsars and Flippers can move from one corridor to the next. Regardless of the tube shapes, aliens always begin their invasion from the small, distant end of the tube. The sixteen unique tube shapes are as follows : [CR]1. Circle [CR]2. Square [CR]3. Plus symbol [CR]4. Bow-tie [CR]5. Stylized Cross [CR]6. Triangle [CR]7. Clover [CR]8. V [CR]9. Steps [CR]10. U [CR]11. Completely Flat [CR]12. Heart [CR]13. Star [CR]14. W [CR]15. Fan [CR]16. Infinity Symbol (figure 8 on its side) [CR]The playfield's colour scheme changes every sixteen levels. In addition, other events also cause playfield colour variation. The SuperZapper causes the playfield to flash as enemies are zapped. Playfield rails flash rainbow colours when a player earns a bonus life and Pulsar enemies cause sections of the nearest rim to disappear and - during the pulse phase - adjacent rails to flash.

However, this new monitor displays dazzling color and unique visual effects in a spectacular 3-D video display.[CR]Players : 2 [CR]Control : dial [CR]Buttons : 2 [CR]= &gt; (1) Fire, (2) Super Zapper[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Tempest was released in October 1981 at the price of $2,295. 25,113 Upright units were produced. Tempest sold approximately 20,000 units to distributors before it was even released. [CR]Tempest was an awesome arcade game that transported the player into abstract realms of space. It is still the favorite of devotees who seek to become one with this adventure through hyperspace. [CR]Tempest was the first game to use 'Color-Quadrascan' and 'Skill-Step', both features unique to Atari vector games. Tempest was originally a 3-D "Space Invaders" clone called 'Vortex', but was changed when the other engineers didn't come back to play the game. This was kind of a test for an Atari game; if the engineers kept coming back to play a new game, it was considered a hit. [CR]The first prototype of the game had the shape wireframe spinning and the gunner remaining stationary, but that caused motion sickness after a period of time so it was changed around. [CR]* The Creation of Tempest : Dave Theurer, who designed the game and wrote the software, said his original intention was to make a first-person perspective of the "Space Invaders" game, but he ended up doing something completely new and different. [CR]Rich Adam : "Dave implemented a first-person "Space Invaders". Everybody played it but they didn't keep coming back. You could tell when you had something cool, the engineers kept coming back. This was good and bad because there were times when you wanted to work on your game and everybody would want to be playing it. But when he was doing the first-person "Space Invaders", Dave didn't run into this problem of everyone wanting to play the game... and he said to himself : 'Well, maybe this isn't working. What can I do?' Then I came in one day and all of a sudden he had this round tube with these things coming up it. I said, 'What the heck is that Dave?' He said, 'I don't know. Aliens from the center of the Earth? I don't know.' I think he said something about having had a dream about it. I said, 'How does it work?' He said, 'I don't know. They're coming up around the edge of this thing and you're trying to blow them away.' He just sort of started out with this concept and took it from there. I can see why he would say that Tempest was certainly his proudest achievement. He worked extremely hard on that. It's pure creation from his own brain.". [CR]* Remembrances from the Video Game Masters : Although known for his hard work and for his ability to focus on and conquer exceedingly tough software problems, Dave Theurer looks back upon his days at Atari as having been fun and rewarding. [CR]Dave Theurer : "It was just so exciting working on these new games. All my life I loved explosions. When I went to college I was a chemistry major because I wanted to do something where I could make explosions. When I was a kid I had a chemistry set and I'd blow stuff up all the time. Eventually, you learn that you can't really do that in real life, so the next best thing is to do it on the screen, so here I was blowing stuff up on the screen. Simulating real life is fun too. It's almost like you can create your own universe. Well, you are creating your own universe. That's rewarding, to see something come alive.". [CR]Playing games, both video and pinball, was a constant part of life for the engineers at Atari. [CR]Dan Pliskin : "In the morning, I used to go in and I'd make up a pot of Italian roast or French roast coffee and pour myself a big mug. Then I'd go and sit it on a pinball machine and drink coffee and play pinball until scores got up to, like, a couple hundred thousand. That would be my indication that I was sharp enough to go and design something.". [CR]* Popular from the Start : Tempest was a game that immediately captivated people from the very start. [CR]Lyle Rains : "Like a number of these games that were very addictive, the Tempest controls were good enough to where once you learned how to manipulate them you could almost become one with the machine. That is, a good Tempest player gets to spin that knob and do the firing in the right time and get into sync with the machine or get into a rhythm. I don't know exactly what to call it, but you were so close to the action that part of you entered the experience. You forgot about what was going on around you and you were just there. And you could get very good at it. I think what people like is the ability to accomplish amazing things". [CR]* The Great 25-Cent Escape : Not only did players often find a sense of welcome escape in the video games they played, but this was very much the intention of some of the great game designers. [CR]Dave Theurer : "I want to design it for a guy who's totally frazzled by his job and needs a way to temporarily escape. There's a certain class of games... where you just get into a trance when you're playing them. As long as you're in this trance you'll do fine." [CR]The default high score screen of "Cyberball 2072" features names of many Atari arcade games, including TEMPEST. [CR]A Tempest unit appears in the 1982 movie 'Fast Times at Ridgemont High', in the 1983 movie 'Twilight Zone - The Movie', in the 1983 movie 'Joysticks', in the 1984 movie 'Night of the Comet', in the 1986 movie 'Running Scared', in the 1986 movie 'Maximum Overdrive' (A cocktail cabinet) and in the 1987 movie 'Death Wish 4 - The Crackdown'. [CR]A Tempest unit appears in the music video 'Subdivisions' by RUSH. [CR]In 1982, Atari released a set of 12 collector pins including : "Missile Command", "Battle Zone", "Tempest", "Asteroids Deluxe", "Space Duel", "Centipede", "Gravitar", "Dig Dug", "Kangaroo", "Xevious", "Millipede" and "Food Fight".[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]Revision 1 :[CR]* First public release.[CR]Revision 2 :[CR]* Fixes the score cheat in test mode.[CR]* Changes spinner letters to a line.[CR]Revision 3 :[CR]* Fixes screen collapse between 1 and 2 players in the 2 player mode.[CR][B]Scoring[/B][CR]Spike : 1-3 points [CR]Spiker : 50 points [CR]Tanker : 100 points [CR]Flipper : 150 points [CR]Pulsar : 200 points [CR]Fuseball : 250, 500, or 750 points (The closer it is to your Blaster when you shoot it, the more points you get.

Whenever you complete a game, you have either ten seconds or until you press a key to continue a game. You can start a game at any bonus level below where you finished your last game. Therefore you must end your previous game on level 12 or higher to start your next game on level 11. [CR]If you fail to clear the starting level you have chosen, that level is not available for you in the next game. However, all starting levels below it are available. For instance, if you start a game on level 17 but do not finish, then your next game can start as high as level 15.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Hints : [CR]- Continue playing until you destroy all aliens or until all the aliens reach the rim of your universe. If you have a Blaster, you advance to the next level of play. [CR]- Players should work their way up through the levels to become familiar with game play. Drop down a level if play is too difficult. [CR]- Experienced players should start at highest level possible for maximum points. [CR]- On a new playfield shoot at enemy dots at far rim. [CR]- Try to shoot aliens while they are still in the corridors of the cosmic tube. They pose a greater threat (and are harder to hit) once they reach the rim of your universe. [CR]- Shoot a Flipper as soon as it starts to flip. Anticipate where they are heading and fire your Blaster in that direction.[CR]- Once a Flipper reaches the rim, you can shoot it only by waiting for it to flip into initial contact with your Blaster. But you must fire before it takes the next step and flips on top of your Blaster.[CR]- Tankers carry other aliens. To destroy their cargo, move your Blaster back and forth across adjacent corridors as you fire.[CR]- Fuseballs spend most of their time along the edges of the corridors, out of firing range. To make sure you hit them, move your Blaster from one side of a corridor to the other while you fire. Once they reach the rim, you can only destroy them with your SuperZapper. [CR]- Use long Spikes to reclaim shots and kill enemies approaching you from adjacent lanes. [CR]- Avoid shooting Fuseball Tankers near the top since emerging fuseballs usually zip up to the top and kill you. [CR]- When Pulsars contract into a zigzag bolt of lightning, quickly move your Blaster away from their corridor. [CR]- Fire at Pulsars after they fire, but before they get ready to fire again. Pulsars and Fuseballs are like Flippers in their ability to switch corridors.[CR]- Watch for corridors that are open along the rim. You can still move your Blaster over the gaps, but beware...there is a Pulsar inside. [CR]- Don't fire at missiles. They are dangerous and you don't get points for destroying them. [CR]- Avoid spikes. At the end of a level, position your Blaster over a corridor that is free from spikes. During higher levels of play, blast away at the Spikers and their spikes to keep a safe corridor for your next hyperspace passage. Remember, you can't destroy them with just one shot.[CR]- Use the SuperZapper right before last enemy reaches the top for a few extra points. [CR]* 898,000 points bonus : [CR]1) You must have the Revision 1 ROMs in your machine. [CR]2) You must have your machine set to coins and not on free-play. [CR]3) Start a game and play until you successfully clear the red V stage. Die. [CR]4) Start a new game on the red V level and complete the stage to get a bonus taking your score to more than 160, 000. [CR]5) As soon as you get the bonus from clearing the red V level get the last two digits of your score to 46 (by shooting spikes). Die. [CR]6) Wait! Wait for one cycle of the machine's attract mode - high score initials, TEMPEST attract, game demonstration, high score table. [CR]7) Start a new game, spin the spinner to the right all the way up to level 1 of the green stages. [CR]8) Complete the stage for a bonus of 898,000. [CR]* These are cheats. (They weren't cheats at all. They were intentionally programmed in as a security measure.) They were removed in ROM 217 and 222 software revision 2. First, you must complete level 8 and get a score with the format XXYYZZ : XX must be greater than 16, YY between 29 and 60, ZZ is a code listed below... [CR]00 - freeze screen [CR]01 - access bookkeeping totals [CR]05 - allows playing during attract mode [CR]06 - 40 free credits [CR]11 - 40 free credits [CR]12 - 40 free credits [CR]14 - credit sound without actual credit [CR]15 - credit sound without actual credit [CR]16 - 40 free credits [CR]17 - 40 free credits [CR]18 - 40 free credits [CR]41 - switch last 2 digits of score [CR]42 - increase score quickly [CR]46 - demonstration mode - start at any level, up to level 81 [CR]50 - player moves by itself [CR]51 - player moves by itself [CR]60 - objects drift down [CR]66 - objects drift right [CR]67 - objects jump [CR]68 - objects drift up [CR]70 - objects drift up [CR]After code '05' (play during attract mode) is activated, the following cheats become available... [CR]Set the last two digits to 46 : Random-colored level with wrong enemies. [CR]Set the last two digits to 48 : 255 extra lives. [CR]These are tips for anyone new to Tempest : [CR]Note : Level colours mentioned below refer to the level's tunnel colour.[CR]1) Flippers first appear in Level 1 (blue circle), but don't start flipping until Level 2 (blue square). Flippers flip at a constant rate, so play the angles. You can kill Flippers on the outer edge by shooting when they are in the spaces next to you (as they flip). The wider the angle, the more time you have to shoot. You can also move under Flippers as they flip. Good practice is to play level 1 as long as possible without firing. On the open shapes, you will want to hang out on one end of the other (to avoid attacks from both directions). On closed shapes, pick a spot with good angles and good visibility. Often flipping back and forth between two spaces (playing the angles depending on which direction the flippers are attacking from) is all you have to do. [CR]2) Tankers first appear in Level 3 (blue plus). Regular Tankers contain two Flippers. Feel free to shoot them and their cargo with impunity. Fuseball tankers are VERY dangerous. Shoot them and get out of the way. Pulsar tankers are also very dangerous. Shoot them and stay where you are (the Pulsars will appear to either side). You can differentiate between the types of tankers by looking closely at their centers. Fuseball and Pulsar Tankers have tiny pictures of their cargos in their centers. The ability to instantly differentiate between tanker types is probably the most important ability separating good Tempest players from great Tempest players. [CR]3) Spikers first appear in Level 4 (blue bowtie). Spikers are generally harmless (although they do shoot at you), and the spikes they lay down are very handy some times. You can hold the fire button down for continuous fire, but you only get a maximum of eight shots at a time. This is enough to fill half the tube, but not enough for a true continuous stream of shots. If you have lots of flippers coming after you, find a long spike to sit on top of. You can then hold down the fire button for a machine gun effect. As the spike gets eaten away, look for another one to switch to. Be careful of pulsars and fuseballs when you do this however. When you get to level 65 (black/invisible circle) try riding a full spike all the way down at the end of the round. Your descent rate and rate of fire are perfectly matched so that you can actually blast it away without being impaled all the way to the bottom. [CR]4) Fuseballs first appear in Level 11 (blue flat/bowling alley). Fuseballs ride the lines. The safest place to be is in the space NEXT to one. It looks like it will kill you, but the hit logic only tests the center of the fuseball. Fuseballs will only cross one space at a time before dropping back down (until the end of the round when they start chasing you). If you get stuck with one coming after you at the end of a round (usually on one of the open shapes), try the 'Hail Mary' move of spinning very quickly. You can actually jump over one or more spaces (and a fuseball!) if you spin fast enough. Watch out for fuseball tankers at higher levels that split into two fuseballs that will immediately try and jump on you. [CR]5) Pulsars first appear in Level 17 (red circle). Pulsars are only dangerous when they are pulsing. Listen to the low, periodic buzz sound. As you get used to it, you will find yourself adapting to this built-in rhythm. You can shoot them when they aren't pulsing or spin out of the way. Watch out for pulsar tankers at higher levels that split into 2 pulsars on either side of the tanker lane. [CR]6) Dip Switch #2 (2nd from the back of the game) on the upper bank (at N13) controls demo mode. Demo mode lets you start (and practice) anywhere you like. It does not record scores, however. In normal play, the game will let you start close to where you left off. If you want to 'cheat', put the game into demo mode, spin up to where you want to start, start the game and hit the player one start button causing you to zoom down the tube and gain the bonus. Then die and flip the dip switch back to normal mode. Now you can start a real game at the same level and record your score at the end. If you do this often, wiring a front-mounted bypass to that dip switch will come in very handy. There is also a freeze game dip switch that is also handy in case the phone rings while you are playing. [CR]7) Level 81 (green circle) is the highest starting level. Most expert Tempest players agree that green is actually easier than the black/invisible levels that precede it. It is a bit faster, but it restores one of the most valuable visual clues in the game - the tell tale break in the outer edge caused by a pulsar (which is missing in the black/invisible levels). After level 96 (green figure eight/infinity), you are back to the green circle (97) and green square (98). Level 99 is the highest recorded by the game and consists of a never ending supply of random green shapes. Every time you finish the round or loose a life, you will end up with a different shape. To achieve a world record score, you will spend MOST of your time playing level 99 over and over again. If you can keep your rate of loss to roughly one life per two rounds (at 20K bonus), you can theoretically play forever. Tempest isn't a very good marathon game, however, as it only lets you build up 5 lives max at any one time. A 30-second bladder break while playing level 99 will pretty much wipe you out. [CR]8) The highest score recordable by the game is 999,999 (a horrible error on the part of the designers). Starting at Level 81, you get there pretty fast (mid way through the greens). With a bit of practice, you can end the game at exactly 999,999. Do that 3 times and no one will ever be able to beat your score on a single machine (w/o clearing the high score table).[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1. Tempest [Upright model] (1981, ARC)[CR]2.

		<plot>Gauntlet (c) 1985 Atari Games.[CR]Gauntlet is a maze-based shoot-em-up for up to four players. Heavily influenced by classic fantasy conventions, players take on the role of either Thor the Warrior, Thyra the Valkyrie, Merlin the Wizard, or Questor the Elf and must play cooperatively as they explore and fight their way through the enemy-packed mazes. Competitive play is encouraged as players must fight for the limited amount of food, treasure, magic potions and power-up items that litter the dungeons. [CR]Each of Gauntlet's four characters have different strengths and weaknesses: Thyra has the strongest armour, Thor is best at hand-to-hand combat, Questor has the fastest speed and Merlin has the most powerful magic attacks. The object of the game is simply to survive as long as possible while exploring Gauntlet's mazes in search of treasure, food, magic potions and, ultimately, the exit that leads to the next dungeon. [CR]The potions - shown as blue bottles - that litter the levels offer either improved character abilities (such as 'speed' or 'extra shot power') or can be used as a 'smart bomb', destroying some or all of the on-screen monsters. Potions are also the only way to kill the game's 'Death' character that appears in many of the stages. Magic potions can be kept and used at the player's discretion by pressing 'Magic' button, although each potion can only be used once. [CR]The first seven mazes are always the same, but from level 8 onwards, players will find themselves on any one of over a hundred different mazes. If players survive for long enough, the mazes will be repeated in a different order. How long a player lasts depends upon the player's 'health' level. Health continually depletes as time progresses and further health is lost by contact with various monsters or their projectiles. Health can be replenished by consuming the food found in the mazes or by inserting more credits. The many treasure chests that litter the levels can be plundered for points, and collecting treasure increases a player's score multiplier when two or more players are playing the game.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Game ID : 136037[CR]Main CPU : Motorola 68010 (@ 7.15909 Mhz), MOS Technology 6502 (@ 1.789772 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : Yamaha YM2151 (@ 3.579545 Mhz), POKEY (Pot Keyboard Integrated Circuit) (@ 1.789772 Mhz), Texas Instruments TMS5220 (@ 650.826 Khz)[CR]Control per player (4): 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons per player (4): 2[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Gauntlet was released in October 1985.[CR]Gauntlet was originally going to be called 'Dungeons' and was inspired not only by TSR's tabletop RPG, 'Dungeons &amp; Dragons', but also by another Atari game called 'Dandy'. Dandy's creator, Jack Palevich, tried fruitlessly to get his name added to the list of credits in Gauntlet. In lieu of public recognition, Atari Games Corp gave Pelvich a Gauntlet cabinet, and he in turn agreed not to sue Atari.[CR]Two character names were changed before release. The Valkyrie was originally named 'Amazon' and the Warrior was 'Hulk'" The first character art was produced on January 1, 1984.[CR]Gauntlet's revolutionary, non-linear game-play gave players multiple choices, as they were no longer forced into taking a linear route through the game. Like 'Dungeons &amp; Dragons', Gauntlet players could choose their own path, searching for keys, treasures, food and transporters to take them to other levels. Unlike most other games at the time, the player didn't always have to fight; a simpler route through the dungeon could sometimes be found, or players could simply try to make a run for it.[CR]In the early '80s, arcades were struggling. Manufacturers created more elaborate games that operators could charge more money for ($.50!), but players were resistant to the increase. The question at Atari was: How do we get extra earnings? The idea with Gauntlet was that with four players you earn four times as much with every play. It was a drop-in/drop-out design so if someone died they could immediately rejoin or someone new could step in -- there was no down time, so the quarters just kept coming. Another choice made specifically to increase the coin drop: there was no end to the game. Gauntlet would recycle levels by flipping them horizontally and vertically once the players had run through all of them. Gauntlet was a big success in 1985. But the marketing team at Atari was actually worried about the four-player cabinet. They weren't sure four strangers would want to play a game together and they also had concerns about the four separate coin shoots (which were known to break easily). Confident in his game, Ed Logg convinced the marketing team to just go with it.[CR]Another Gauntlet milestone was in the game's use of sound effects. Synthesized human voices had been used sporadically in games in the early eighties and while it had proved, on most occasions, to be moderately successful, was still considered something of a novelty. Gauntlet, however, revolutionized the concept of in-game speech and added immeasurably to the game's superb atmosphere. The deep timbre of Gauntlet's very own 'Dungeon Master' would guide players through the levels, informing them that 'Elf needs food, badly', or that 'Wizard is about to die' and the always-good advice that is 'Remember, don't shoot food.'[CR]Note: The game contains exactly 212 sounds (including digitized voices, effects and musics).[CR]It was common practice to test a new arcade game at select locations before wide release. The operator was given the cabinet for free, but in exchange they couldn't promote it (as a precaution against competition) and they would share the coin drop numbers of it and all the other machines at the location so that Atari could evaluate the new game's success against current games. But when Ed Logg came by to check on Gauntlet during its field test, he found developers from SEGA snapping photos of the cabinet. Atari pulled it from that location and didn't work with the operator henceforth. A year after Gauntlet's release in 1985, SEGA released a four-player arcade game called "Quartet" (although it was side-scrolling). [CR]7,848 units were sold in the U.S. A few thousand more were sold in Japan and Europe. Even though Atari considered Gauntlet a success, earlier games like "Space Invaders" and "Ms. Pac-Man" sold hundreds of thousands of cabinets. One of Gauntlet's contemporaries from Atari, the excellent Temple of Doom game, sold just 2,800 copies. [CR]Note : There were 20 officially released versions (see Updates section for detailed info), including 6 '2-player' versions and various Spanish, German and Japanese versions. Counting 4-player English variants alone, there were 7 releases with various bug-fixes.[CR]The default high score screen of "Cyberball 2072" features names of many Atari arcade games, including GAUNTLET.[CR]Charles Nagle holds the official record for this game with 4,401,169 points on March 28, 2003.[CR]Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (That's Atari Music Vol.II : G.S.M.

Allow the players with the best fighting ability and armor (usually Thyra the Valkyrie and Thor the Warrior) to lead the way and fend off attacks.[CR]5) Avoid contact with the ghosts : they take away your health very quickly and you cannot fight them hand-to-hand.[CR]* If you remain motionless (or basically aimless) and stall off about 30 health, all of the doors will open. Everybody knows this, and the game even tells you about it. The game doesn't tell you that if you stall off about 200 health, all the walls will turn into exits! (work on Revision 6 and +) The game designers had to include this because there are some levels which require you to pick up a key before you exit. If you are already filled up with keys, and the doors are all gone, then it would be IMPOSSIBLE for you to exit, and you would starve to death. What they didn't anticipate, is that certain levels of the game which are really difficult, which would require you to take massive health losses to finish, become very simple if all the walls are exits. Or they can be effectively skipped altogether. Because the game has Monty-Hall levels with lots of food on them, you can use this cheat to only play levels which are a wash or increase your health dramatically, and cut your losses to 200 on all the really hard levels.[CR]* The best character to play, in the LONG run, is Questor. His magic is just as good as Merlin's and his fight ability as good as Thor's. His ability to shoot through cracks in addition to all this (when he has the power potions) makes him the best. Thyra is the worst, although some people regard this as a challenge...[CR]* To manipulate the point value of Death, shoot him. Death's point value takes the following progression : 1000-2000-1000-4000-1000-6000-1000-8000, and then back to start. His value keeps from the previous game.[CR]* You can kill Death painlessly by teleporting on top of him.[CR]* If a previous game ended beyond Level 8, Level 8 in the next game becomes the level that the previous game ended on. If you got a really good sequence of boards in a game and you want to repeat them, turn the machine off and on again after you've entered your high score.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

		<plot>Rampage (c) 1986 Bally Midway.[CR]Rampage is a classic B-movie inspired smash-em-up in which up to three players take on the roles of three mutated monsters - George the giant ape, Lizzie the giant lizard and Ralph the giant wolf - who move from city to city destroying skyscrapers and vehicles, while eating or killing any people that get in their way. [CR]The monsters' health can be damaged in a number of ways: by being shot by National Guardsmen, by being hit by another monster, by falling from a building, by being hit by police cars or tanks, by going underwater, by being struck by lightning, or by eating something bad, such as dynamite. Health is replenished by eating food found in damaged buildings. [CR]If the players' health gauge diminishes completely, the monsters will revert back to their original human form and walk sideways off the screen. Rampage has a "buy back in" option, however; if players chose to continue the game before the human figure leaves the play area, the game will continue from that stage. [CR]Rampage is set over the course of 128 days in cities across North America. The game starts in Peoria, Illinois and ends in Plano, Illinois. In Plano, players receive a mega vitamin bonus which heals all the monsters and provides a large point bonus. After this, the cycle of cities repeats five times. After 768 days, the game resets back to Day One. [CR]* Examples of bonuses and hazards found inside damaged buildings: [CR]Food: Milk, Turkey, Hot Toast, Fruit [CR]Bonus: Flower Pot, TV Set, Money Bag [CR]Hazard: Cactus, Poison, Toaster [CR]* Examples of bonuses and hazards found outside damaged buildings: [CR]Bonus: Auto (or Truck), Commuter Train, Person in Manhole [CR]Hazard: National Guard Tank, Police Car, Storm Cloud [CR]Further bonus points can be earned by grabbing a fleeing 'Townie' from a building window. This has two benefits: 1) While holding the Townie, all swat team members disappear from the building windows and 2) accumulating points are scored during the time the Townie is held.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Bally Midway MCR 3 hardware[CR]Game No. 0E36[CR]Main CPU: Zilog Z80 (@ 5 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU: Motorola 68000 (@ 8 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips: DAC[CR]Players: 3[CR]Control: 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons: 2[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Rampage was released in October 1986.[CR]It was also released as a conversion kit for Star Guards as "Rampage [No. 00F06]".[CR]Rampage incorporates Bally Midway's JOIN THE ACTION feature : each set of game controls includes a corresponding start (Jump) button, which is activated independently. This allows a person, after inserting the proper coinage, to begin play at any time including while the other sets of game controls are in use.[CR]Rampage has an impressive 768 different levels. The 128th level of the game is 'Plano, Illinois', and was the only level in the game with less than three buildings. Brian, one of the designers, said : Plano Illinois was only two buildings because Plano Il is a Tiny town, in which my partner Jeff was born and raised.[CR]These are the random headlines you may encounter during the game. These headlines appear when the next day begins :[CR]EX-MUTANT IS ARRESTED FOR STREAKING![CR]LAB SCREW-UP WEARS OFF...FILM AT 11[CR]SPOUSE OF MUTANT FILES LEGAL ACTION[CR]FORMER BEAST SAYS IT MAY HAPPEN AGAIN[CR]STILL AT LARGE...VERY LARGE![CR]IS THERE NO END TO THIS RAMPAGE???[CR]PROPERTY VALUES AT ALL TIME LOW[CR]YOUR AD HERE CALL NOW! 1-800-ZOO-KEEP[CR]JOB OPENINGS IN NATIONAL GUARD![CR]REAL LIFE JEKYLL AND HYDE STORY!![CR]A Rampage unit appears in the 1991 movie 'Terminator 2 - Judgment Day'.[CR]Rampage was included as a bonus in "Rampage - Total Destruction" for the Nintendo GameCube, Sony PlayStation 2, and Nintendo Wii.[CR][B]Scoring[/B][CR]Scoring in this game is relatively complicated due to the various numbers of enemies. In addition, you also score points for hitting buildings and collecting bonus and/or food items. [CR]* ITEMS [CR]Bag of loot : 100-500 points. [CR]Boater : 750 points. [CR]Building destroyed : 2,500 points - You will only get the points if your monster destroys the building. Buildings destroyed by things other than you monster will not earn you these points. [CR]Car (parked) : 100 points. [CR]Car (moving slowly) : 200 points. [CR]Car (parked then takes off quickly) : 750 points. [CR]Food such as turkey, milk, fruit, hamburger, or toast : 175 points. [CR]Eating one of the civilians : 500 points. [CR]Flower pot : 500 points. [CR]Helicopter : 750 points. [CR]Holding designated victim : 4,000 - 6,000 points. [CR]Light bulb (off) : 500 points. [CR]Manhole cover (per hit) : 500 points. [CR]Mega-vitamin bonus (every 128 days) : 5,000 points. [CR]National guardsman : 50 points. [CR]Neon sign : 1,000 points. [CR]Paratrooper : 50 points. [CR]Photographer : 750 points. [CR]Police car : 750 points. [CR]Punch causes partial break in building : 25 points. [CR]Punch cause full break/hole in building : 225 points. [CR]Safe (after opening) : 100-500 points. [CR]Tank : 200 points. [CR]Television (off) : 500 points. [CR]Train (per hit) : 500 points.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]You start the game with your monsters at the bottom of the screen. After the game starts, it is time for you to start the 'urban renewal' process.[CR]* After you start, you will start being attacked. There is no real way to avoid a lot of the attacks by the National Guardsmen due to the sheer volume of fire they are laying down. Your best bet is to keep moving and make yourself a hard target to hit.[CR]* To move quickly from building to building, jump toward the building and push up to grab the building. This enables you to use your monster's ability to both jump and climb at the same time.[CR]* To relieve some pressure from the National Guardsmen, climb up the buildings and smash the windows where they pop out from or just eat them when they are leaning out the window. Move quickly since their buddies are still shooting or throwing dynamite at your monster.[CR]* Unless you are totally obsessed with points, let the National Guardsmen do your work for you. A great example of this is that about midway through a day, a National Guard-man will rush out from the side of the screen with explosives. They will place them at the base of a building. This demolishes the building and helps you along to the next day.[CR]* Another way to destroy buildings is to weaken it up, then jump on the roof. Your monster's weight will cause the building to collapse.[CR]* The air units can be rather dangerous. During the beginning days, the helicopters will overfly your monster, turn around, and then dive in for the attack. You can destroy the helicopters when they are coming in to prevent their attack. Also, when you are moving around, you make it harder for them to get a bead on your monster.[CR]* During the later days, helicopters will drop bombs. Again, paying attention to everything that is going on will allow you to easily escape the bomb being dropped. You can also entice the helicopter to drop a bomb when you are on top of a building. When the bomb is dropped, jump out of the way and let the bomb do the damage to the building for you.[CR]* Make sure that you either grab the food or eat the National Guardsmen to keep your health up. If you can hold out for 128 days, you will get all of your health restored for that day and days 256, 384, 512, 640, and 768. Also keep in mind that if you punch too fast, you may end up getting something that will harm your monster.[CR]* Paratroopers can be a particular pain. If you plan to attack a building with a Paratrooper unit on it, make sure you quickly scale the building and eat said unit. It makes life a lot easier since their rapid fire can put a major hurting on your monster.[CR]* Ground units such as Tanks and Police Cars can be a real nuisance. They fire some pretty heavy shells which not only cause a lot of damage, but they also can knock back your monster for quite a distance. There are some ways to combat these units :[CR]1) Climb quickly up a building. When the unit passes below you, jump down and give it a good punch.[CR]2) Time the shots and rush the ground unit in-between shots to get a good punch in.[CR]3) Use available weapons such as manhole covers, flower pots, or safes to drop on them. These things also allow you to hit them at a distance.[CR]* Be sure and watch what your monster grabs at. There are a lot of hazards in the buildings and it is pretty bad when your monster buys the farm doing dumb stuff such as grabbing electrical items such as toasters and light bulbs.[CR]* In addition to the above, dynamite is sometimes in the middle of buildings. When uncovered, you have about two to three seconds to get your monster out of there before they are blown off the building. Eating it will only decrease your monster's health so run far away when it is uncovered.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1. Rampage [No. 0E36] (1986, Arcade) [CR]2. Rampage - World Tour (1997, Arcade)[CR]3.

		<plot>R*Type (c) 1987 Irem Corp.[CR]R*Type is a sideways-scrolling shoot-em-up in which the evil Bydo Empire rules the galaxy through fear and intimidation and it's up to the player - piloting their heavily-armed R-9 space ship - to battle through eight tough levels to the heart of the Bydo stronghold and defeat them.[CR]The game's revolutionary weapons system is its real stroke of genius. The first of numerous innovations that R*Type bought to the genre is the beam weapon: when the fire button is held down, a 'power meter' starts to charge up; once the meter is full, releasing the fire button unleashes a very powerful plasma burst capable of inflicting much greater damage to enemy ships or even destroying numerous enemies simultaneously. The trade-off is that charging the weapon takes up valuable seconds, giving the Bydo ships time to attack.[CR]The most significant addition to R-type's arsenal is the now-legendary 'Force Pod'. This takes the form of an invincible, detachable laser-firing pod that can be attached to either the front or rear of the player's ship, or can be detached completely, after which the pod sits some distance either ahead or behind the player's ship, tracking its movements and providing additional fire power. When attached to the R9 ship, the pod acts as a shield. This forms a crucial part of R*Type's gameplay and has to be fully utilised to navigate certain sections of the game, such as the huge mothership that comprises the game's 3rd stage.[CR]R*Type's levels are designed to make full use of its unique weapons system, making for very linear and demanding gameplay in which losing or picking up the wrong weapon at the wrong time often leads to an instant death. Its intelligent, precise and demanding level design, gave the world its first truly 'strategic' shoot-em-up.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Irem M-72 system hardware[CR]Main CPU : V30 (@ 8 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 3.579545 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : Yamaha YM2151 (@ 3.579545 Mhz)[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 2[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]R*Type was released in July 1987. [CR]Licensed to Nintendo of America for US manufacture and distribution. [CR]R*Type is one of the most famous of all scrolling shooters. Its impressive graphics, detailed animation, inventive features and simple yet surprisingly involved gameplay made it a huge success for Irem. [CR]The first boss, as well as some of the stages, seem inspired by the artistic works of H. R. Giger (of 'Aliens' fame). He makes a brief cameo in the TV sets in "Undercover Cops". [CR]Alfa Records released a limited-edition soundtrack cassette for this game (R*Type : Irem Game Music - 28XA-199) on January 25, 1988.[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]At the title screen, the prototype version says 'Play and enjoy the game' instead of 'Blast off and strike the evil Bydo empire!', as it does in the final version.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Force Pod levels:[CR]1) Level 1: Fires single bullet when separated.[CR]2) Level 2: Fires twin shots when separated.[CR]3) Level 3: Fires four shots up, down and forwards when separated.[CR]* Weapons:[CR]1) Speed Up: Alters your ship's speed.[CR]2) Missile: Fires two rather nice homing missiles.[CR]3) Bouncy: Blue lasers bounce around the screen.

If you shoot where a bee medal is hidden, it starts to blink. Then you will need to use your laser to free it, before you can collect the medal.[CR]* Hits : There is a combo score system for hits within a specific time range. If it takes too long for your next hit, the chain breaks and counting restarts.[CR]* Hidden 1up player : In stage 3 is your one and only chance to pick up a 1up item. It is hidden in the giant red spaceship you will pass later in the stage. To get it, open all 6 side-boxes with your laser, before you destroy the main tower in the center of the ship. You are not allowed to use your smartbomb for these actions. Otherwise the 1up item would not appear in the ruins of the tower afterwards.[CR]* Bomb Stock : If you don't use the smartbombs and keep the stock display at 'maximum' bonus multiplier will be 2x.[CR]* Flower bloom : There are a few places in the game you will meet flowers growing in ruins. If you fly near them they will bloom. This is more than just a joke of the graphic artist. It can reward you with a nice bonus score :[CR](each) flower blooming : 10 points per 1/60 sec.[CR]+ your shots hit it : 510 points per bullet[CR]+ your laser crosses it : 1'100 points per 1/30 sec.[CR]* Second loop : To access the second (harder) loop thus being able to fight against Hibachi, the 'true' final boss after level 6 boss, you have to complete the first 6 levels with only one credit and meet at least one of these conditions :[CR]- Don't lose more than 2 fighters (lives). [CR]- Depending on the fighter, have a maximum hit count of at least : [CR]Type A : 270 hits [CR]Type B : 300 hits [CR]Type C : 330 hits [CR]- At least 50 million points by the end of level 6.

		<plot>Space Harrier (c) 1985 Sega.[CR]Space Harrier is a sprite-scaling 3D shoot-em-up set in the 'Fantasy Zone'; a surreal world composed of abstract structures and a checkerboard landscape. The game's enemies are as abstract as its setting; with creatures including prehistoric Mammoths, alien pods, giant mushrooms and, at the end of most stages, a huge, fireball-spitting Chinese Dragon.[CR]The player's on-screen counterpart carries a portable jetpack under his arm which allows him to fly. The player can also run along the ground to avoid overhead structures and enemies.[CR]In addition to its flight capability, the jetpack is also equipped with a laser, used to destroy both the game's many enemies as well as some (but not all) obstructions, such as the trees and floating rocks on the first stage.[CR]Space Harrier has a total of 18 stages, each with a boss fight at the end. Three exceptions are the bonus stages (5th and 12th) and the 18th stage, which is a 'boss rush' featuring some of the bosses encountered up to that point.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR][1] [Sit-Down model][CR][2] [Rolling model][CR][3] [Upright model][CR]Players : 1[CR]Control : stick[CR]Buttons : 3 (FIRE, FIRE, FIRE)[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Space Harrier was released in October 1985 in Japan.[CR]The pioneer 3-D shooting game realized by a high speed 3-D processing.

		<plot>Total Carnage (c) 1992 Midway.[CR]A pseudo-sequel to Williams' superb 1990 shoot-em-up, "Smash TV", Total Carnage is set in a futuristic parody of the first Gulf War. General Ahkboob, himself an obvious parody of Sadam Hussein, has set his vast army of infantry, tanks and BioGenetic Mutants onto the world.[CR]1 or 2 players must fight through the enemy-packed levels, rescuing reporters and civilians as they go. Total Carnage retains the dual-joystick control of its predecessor, but introduced new weapons, enemies and large, scrolling levels to the original game-play.[CR]As with "Smash TV", Total Carnage features the infamous 'Pleasuredome'; accessible only if players manage to collect the 220 keys that are hidden throughout the game's levels. Total Carnage has a much higher difficulty level than that of "Smash TV".[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Midway Y Unit hardware[CR]Main CPU: TMS34010 (@ 6.25 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU: Motorola M6809 (@ 2 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips: Yamaha YM2151 (@ 3.57958 Mhz), DAC, OKI6295 (@ 8 Khz)[CR]Players: 2[CR]Control: Double 8-way joysticks[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Total Carnage was released in January 1992 in North America.

The game's slow sales resulted in Turmell taking on a different project for his next game, which would become the highly successful NBA Jam.[CR]General Akhboob's role as a parody of Saddam Hussein becomes obvious during the game's cut-scenes; as well as him saying slogans from Smash T.V., he makes an obvious reference to the original Gulf War by announcing that 'all we are making is baby milk.'.[CR]While playing the game, there is a message which says 'the pistons will rule the NBA'. This is a reference to the Detroit Pistons who Mark Turmell was a fan of. Coincidentially, 12 years later, the Detroit Pistons would win the NBA Championship.[CR]Originally the game was programmed to display one of two endings upon completion of the Pleasuredome bonus level. One ending would feature the women from Smash TV and was to be displayed if the player collected all the treasures in the dome. A second bad ending showed the same screen without the women along with a message challenging the player to collect all the dome's treasure. However, a bug in the game caused the good ending to be displayed with the bad ending text no matter how many treasures were collected.[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]* Rev 1.0[CR]* Rev LA1[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Password : enter the password on the 'red and white' warp at the beginning of the first mission.[CR]Mission 1 :[CR]'GOOB' - Gate (heading Checkpoint #1).[CR]'ZULU' - Bunker (heading Checkpoint #2).[CR]'ORCS' - Orcus (boss).[CR]Mission 2 :[CR]'ROAD' - Road one (heading Checkpoint #3).[CR]'LIPS' - Airport gate (heading Checkpoint #4).[CR]'LICK' - Airfield (heading Checkpoint #5).[CR]'FIRE' - Hangar.[CR]'FOOD' - Road two (heading Checkpoint #6).[CR]Mission 3 :[CR]'EATS' - Monster Cutscene.[CR]'TOID' - Factory (heading Checkpoint #7).[CR]'BOOF' - Reactor.[CR]'MARK' - Reactor basement (heading Checkpoint #10).[CR]Misc :[CR]'SHOK' - Electric chair.[CR]'DOME' - Akhboob escaped and lacking keys.[CR]'WORM' - Caught Akhboob but lacking keys.[CR]'AZAZ' - Warp to Pleasure Dome with 500 keys.[CR][B]Staff[/B][CR]Total Carnage Design Team: Mark Turmell (MJT), John Tobias (JON), Shawn Liptak (SL!), Jim Gentile, Eugene Jarvis (DRJ) (EPJ), Tony Goskie[CR]Music and Sounds: Jon Hey (HEY)[CR]Voices: Ed Boon (EJB)[CR]Special Thanks: George N.

		<plot>Smash T.V. (c) 1990 Williams Electronics Games, Incorporated.[CR]The year is 1999. Television has adapted to the more violent nature of man. The most popular form of television remains the game show. One show in particular has dominated the ratings. That show is SMASH TV. The most violent game show of all time. Two lucky contestants compete for cash and prizes. Each contestant is armed with an assortment of powerful weapons and sent into a closed arena. The action takes place in front of a studio audience and is broadcast live via satellite around the world. Be prepared. The future is now. You are the next lucky contestant![CR]Smash TV Game Rules:[CR]1. Move with LEFT joystick to avoid enemies and gather prizes (cash and game show gifts).[CR]2. Fire weapons with RIGHT joystick and collect power-up icons for increased firepower.[CR]3. Advance to next game arena when enemies are gone.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]The first series of cabinet was released with 19-inch monitors while the more common second series was fitted with 25-inch monitors.[CR]Williams Y Unit hardware[CR]Game No. 3044-U1[CR]Main CPU : TMS34010[CR]Sound CPU : Motorola M6809[CR]Sound Chips : Yamaha YM2151, DAC, HC55516[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : Double 8-way joysticks[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Smash T.V. was released in April 1990.[CR]A superb spiritual sequel to 1982's legendary single screen shoot-em-up, "Robotron: 2084". The Classic Robotron game-play is enhanced further with the addition of power-ups and imaginative and challenging end-of-level bosses. The two-player game introduced a very high level of competitiveness as both players try to beat each other to the power-ups, prizes and keys.[CR]The game seems to be based, at least in part, on the sci-fi action movie, 'The Running Man', starring Arnold Schwarzenegger. This movie itself was based on a book of the same name by Stephen King (under the pseudonym 'Richard Bachman').[CR]One of Smash TV's more memorable elements was the game show host; at random intervals, a garishly suited, grinning host would pop up and enthusiastically announce such memorable sound-bites as, 'Total carnage! I love it!', 'I'll buy that for a dollar!' (taken from the 1987 movie Robocop), 'I love it!', 'Big money! Big prizes! I love it!'.[CR]A Smash T.V. sequel was planned, but the project never got past the planning stage and nothing more was heard of it. While Smash TV has yet to see a fully-fledged sequel, it WAS followed by a semi-sequel in the form of 'Total Carnage'; a military-themed scrolling shoot-em-up which was housed in a cabinet very similar to that of Smash T.V.s and shared the same dual joystick controls. Upon completion of Total Carnage's incredibly difficult first level, a message screen appeared stating that "all Smash T.V. players should quit and flee from this machine" before Total Carnage's already high difficulty level increased further. A solid follow-up to an already challenging game.[CR]On the 2005 video game "Grand Theft Auto - Liberty City Stories", there is a side-mission called 'Slash TV', which parodies this game, where the player's character is surrounded by enemies, and is awarded cash for eliminating waves of them. The camera angle changes from the game's traditional third-person to a slightly angled overhead view so it looks like the original.[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]Revision 1 :[CR]* Software version 3.01.[CR]Revision 2 :[CR]* Software version 4.00.[CR]Revision 3 :[CR]* Software version 5.00.[CR]* Added the 'Reset secret warp' (see 'Tips And Tricks' section for more info).[CR]* Reduced difficulty (Factory setting : 3 (easy) instead of 5 (medium)).[CR]Revision 4 :[CR]* Software version 6.00.[CR]Revision 5 :[CR]* Software version 8.00.[CR]* Added the famous 'Pleasure Dome'.[CR]* Changed some 'in-game texts'.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Secret Warp (Works on 5.00 and Up) : when you start a game of Smash T.V. on the first level, reset the machine, it'll take you to the 'Secret Warp 3' and take you to the third boss stages.[CR]* Difficulty : the game is known to adjust its difficulty by the daily high score list. If the high scores are too high, making the game too hard, just reset the machine :).[CR]* Don't try to conserve ammo. Your shots should be efficient and kill as much as possible, and you won't have time to think about conserving shots (especially in the latter stages). The pattern of moves you should follow at the end of each board to reach the easiest boards is :[CR]Level 1 : right, up; and then you have no choices.[CR]Level 2 : up, right; and then again, no choices.[CR]Level 3 : right, right, down; and then you have no choices.[CR]* When playing with 2 people, if one player finishes the level near an exit, the other will 'walk through the wall' to the next room. Can be useful on some levels.[CR][B]Staff[/B][CR]Smash TV Design Team: Mark Turmell (MJT), John Tobias (JON), Tim Coman (TIM), Eugene Jarvis (DRJ), Todd Allen, George N. Petro, Larry DeMar, Jack E.

		<plot>R*Type Leo (c) 1992 Irem.[CR]R-Type Leo is a horizontally-scrolling shoot-em-up and is the third and final arcade release of this classic series (although numerous console-only sequels would follow, see 'Series' for details).[CR]Mankind are currently at peace with their former adversaries, the Bydo Empire, and have taken the opportunity to undertake a massive project called 'Project Paradise'. This involved the construction of an artificial terrestrial-like planet called 'Eden', created as a safe haven should humanity once again find itself under threat. However, soon after construction is completed, 'Major' - the bio-computer system responsible for maintaining Eden - malfunctions, taking control of the planet's defences and launching an attack on mankind. It is up to the newly-developed 'R-9 Leo' fleet to fly in and stop Major's assault on its creators.[CR]R-Type Leo deviates from the gameplay style of its predecessors by removing the use of both the 'Force Pod' and the 'Wave Cannon'. The new weapons are called 'Force Bits' (later identified in "R-Type Final" as "Psy Bits") and the 'Bit Shot'. The three 'Force Bit' weapon types are:[CR]* Red - Claw Laser: a powerful horizontal laser beam and horizontal traverse wave[CR]* Blue - Mirror Laser: fires multiple, ricocheting lasers.[CR]* Green - Search Laser LRG: fires semi-homing lasers that can bend at 90 degree angles.[CR]Unlike previous 'Bit' devices, the 'Force/Psy Bits' are capable of firing either forwards or backwards (their direction dictated by the movement of the ship itself). Finally, the 'Wave Cannon' is replaced by a 'Bit Shot', in which the Psy Bits detach from the ship and collide with the nearest enemy. The Bits can only do this for a limited time before running out of energy, and must be recalled to the ship to recharge.[CR]R Type Leo consists of 6 stages and is the first game in the series to allow 2 players to play simultaneously.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Irem M-92 system hardware[CR]Main CPU : V33 (@ 9 Mhz), V30 (@ 7.15909 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : Yamaha YM2151 (@ 3.579545 Mhz), GA20 (@ 3.579545 Mhz)[CR]Screen orientation : Horizontal[CR]Video resolution : 320 x 240 pixels[CR]Screen refresh : 60.00 Hz[CR]Palette colors : 2048[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 2[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Released in December 1992.[CR]R*Type Leo was developed by Irem's internal group, 'Nanao' (authors of the famous "Meikyuu Jima"); the original authors of R*Type's series moved to 'Aicom' (bought by SNK) and went on to develop another superb shoot-em-up, "Pulstar"; released in 1995.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

		<plot>Boogie Wings (c) 1992 Data East Corp.[CR]A superbly playable, humourous and utterly unique shoot-em-up from the Date East stable. The player begins each life in control of a bi-plane with a huge metal hook attached to its rear. This hook can be used to pick up enemies, objects, bombs and vehicles which can then be thrown both at other enemies, and at any walls and doorways that may be barring the player's route.[CR]If the bi-plane takes two hits from enemy forces, it will explode and the player is forced to continue on foot. The on-foot sections play in a vaguely similar fashion to SNK's legendary "Metal Slug" series, but while on foot, the player has no protection from enemy hits and is very vulnerable to attack. As such, a replacement vehicle (which appear in the form of tanks, motorbikes, giant robots, elephants etc.) must be found quickly.[CR]Boogie Wings features highly detailed and completely destructible scenery, with a multitude of background animations making the game feel 'alive' and giving it much of its distinctive character. The game's settings are as original as its gameplay; with museums, fairgrounds, the inside of skyscrapers etc. all making an appearance. Boogie Wings soundtrack is also unique to the genre, with a mixture of well-known jazz and blues tunes accompanying the frenetic on-screen action.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]PCB # : DE-0379-1[CR]Main CPU : Motorola 68000 (@ 14 Mhz)[CR]Sound : Hudson Soft HuC6280A, YM2151, YM3012, (2x) OKI6295[CR]RAM: (2x) 62256, (5x) 6264[CR]Dipswitch : (2x) 8 position[CR]Players : 1[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Released in December 1992 in US.[CR]This game is also known as "The Great Ragtime Show".[CR]The 'Blues Brothers' appear in the 'Merry Merry Christmas' stage.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Secret Character 'Santa Claus' : on the 'Merry Merry Christmas' stage, pick up the stage boss's head parts with the skyhook and throw it after you have destroyed the boss.

[CR]Ships have been mysteriously disappearing in the vicinity of the Bahamas for years. Now, in 1930, the United States government sends an expedition to the area in a flying boat to determine the cause. As they survey the ocean, the expedition comes across an uncharted landmass which they dub "Greenhell Isle" and launches two reconnaissance biplanes to take a closer look. As they investigate the island, the biplanes come under attack by dinosaurs and other life forms that were thought to have become extinct millions of years ago. [CR]The player takes control of a biplane armed with a forward-firing machine gun. It can also be equipped with an option weapon pod that can be rotated clockwise around the craft. The option's attack changes depending on where it is currently positioned:[CR]* When directly above or below the plane, the option fires energy waves that reflect back upon contact with a surface.[CR]* When diagonally above the plane, the option fires balls of energy that bounce off surfaces at a 45 degree angle.[CR]* When diagonally below the plane, the option drops bombs.[CR]* When directly in front of the plane, the option replaces the default machine gun with its own flame cannon.[CR]* When directly behind the plane, the option deploys aerial mines.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Game ID : A8003 'GT'[CR]Main CPU : Motorola 68000 (@ 12 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 4 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : YM3812 (@ 4 Mhz), UPD7759 (@ 640 Khz)[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 2[CR]=&gt; [A] Shoot, [B] Pod[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Released in June 1989.[CR]This game is known in Japan as "Genshi-Tou 1930's".[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]The US version is slightly different, it has the "Winners Don't Use Drugs" logo.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

		<plot>Pole Position (c) 1982 Namco.[CR]Pole Position is a 1-player game using a color raster-scan video display. Game action takes place at the Fuji Speedway in Japan. The country around the speedway consists of green meadows, hills, and snow-capped Mt. Fuji. [CR]The player drives a Formula-1 race car on the track. The first objective of the game is to finish the qualifying lap as quickly as possible. If the player beats the clock, he or she qualifies for the race. If not, he or she drives out the remainder of the time along the qualifying course. [CR]As a qualifier, the player is ranked according to his or her qualifying lap time, from the 1st (pole) position to the 8th. The second objective of the game is to race against the clock and other cars to finish the specified number of laps ('Nr. of Laps' dip switch setting; 3 laps is the default) of the race as fast as possible and to achieve the highest score possible. The player earns points for passing cars, driving on the track, and finishing the race with time remaining. He or she is rewarded with an extended-play lap for completing the first lap within a certain amount of time (depending on the 'Extended Rank' dip switch setting). [CR]The game starts with the player's car behind the starting line and a certain amount of time, in seconds ('Game Time' dip switch setting; the default is 90 seconds), will be on the clock. The player's car must finish the qualifying lap within a certain amount of time (which varies depending on the 'Practice Rank' dip switch setting) to be in the race. If the player does not qualify, his or her car continues on the track until the 'Game Time' elapses.[CR]If the player has qualified, just before the race begins, the player's car (flashing on the screen) is placed at the starting line with seven other cars. The position of the car depends on the position earned during the qualifying lap. (The player's car is always place at the 8th position in the attract mode.)[CR]The starting lights flash from red to green, and the race begins. Racing hazards are other racing cars, sharp turns, road signs, and water puddles. (All of these hazards except for water puddles are also present on the qualifying lap.) As the race progresses, more cars appear on the track. If the player's car hits another car or a road sign, it is destroyed in an explosion. The player's car reappears in a few seconds and the race continues. Driving through water puddles or off the track slows down the player's car. [CR]Racing into the first turn, the player must let up on the accelerator slightly to make the corner. Road signs flash along the side of the track. Depending on how well the player manipulates the controls, he or she can either roar through the hairpin turns like a champion or spin out in a flaming crash. He or she jockeys for position with the other racers, while keeping his or her eye on the clock at the top of the screen. When time runs out, the race is over. If the player has beaten the racing lap time and has seconds remaining, the remaining seconds are added to the extended lap time, which varies depending on the 'Extended Rank' dip switch setting. [CR]The top score achieved by a player appears at the top of the screen. The time allotted for the lap is displayed under the top score. Increasing lap time (in seconds and hundredths of a second) and the speed of the car appears last.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR][Upright model] [CR]Game ID : PP [CR]Main CPU : Zilog Z80 (also drives the sound), Zilog Z8002 (x2) [CR]Sound Chips : Namco 6-channel stereo WSG, DAC (engine sound), discrete circuitry (crash and skid sounds), custom DAC (speech) [CR]Players : 1 [CR]Controls : Steering wheel, gear shifter (Hi and Low) [CR]Pedals : Accelerator only[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Pole Position was released in July 1982 outside of North America.[CR]When Pole Position was introduced, players lined up in arcades around the world to grip the steering wheel and stomp on the gas pedal of a driving game so realistic that the players -- just like their cars -- were swerving around the corners. Pole Position was a 14-carat contribution to the golden age of video games. It started the trend for photo-realism in video game graphics. In addition to great graphics, it had great game play and it was a huge success, dominating game charts for almost about two years. [CR]Pole Position was the first driving game to be based on a real circuit. The action takes place at Fuji Speedway in Japan. The snow-capped Mt. Fuji appears in the background.[CR]* A place in video game history : "Pole Position stands out as the racing game that really appealed to the general public," said Chris Lindsey, director of the National Video Game and Coin-Op Museum in St. Louis. "It went into arcades across the nation, where it can still be found. Pole Position machines were placed everywhere -- even in gas stations!". The popularity of Pole Position was based on its realism. Players felt as if they were actually in the driver's seat. "Racing games before Pole Position tended to have a top-down perspective in which you floated over the course, which wasn't terribly realistic," Lindsey said. "Pole Position's eye-level point of view gave it a great deal of realism, and this point of view became a standard for racing games that followed. In addition, it provided a lot of peripheral cues. You saw lots of things zipping by on the side of the screen and this really added to the excitement of the game. Pole Position also had great sound. You could hear the gears winding out in the stretches. As you zipped by another car, you could hear that car's engine. All of these details added to the overall effect. Pole Position was, and still is, an awfully nice game."[CR] * The great 25-cent escape : Chris Lindsey believes that a big reason why Pole Position has remained such a timeless classic is that it has always appealed to women, in addition to men. "I think there are quite a few game developers who would like to figure out why some games appeal to females," Lindsey said. "Perhaps this is just pop psychology, but I've seen two types of games women will take to: racing games, and games in which the character, or your representation on screen, is doing something besides destroying bad guys. I don't know if that's the correct way to describe it, but that is what I've seen. I've had occasion to work in different types of entertainment facilities, large and small, very modern and, of course, the museum. Without fail I see women take to 'Pac-Man', and I see them take to racing games, almost regardless of what the racing game is." [CR]* Lindsey said the comparative lack of violence in Pole Position and other racing games might explain their popularity with women -- as well as with men. "I think violence in games is fairly thoughtless for men, and for some women, the violence in a video game may stick out," Lindsey said. "Violence in gaming is not an experience that most people seek even though they like video games. When those people find games that are engaging, and that offer outstanding game play, there is a desire on their part to dive into it. These racing games really offer that." [CR]* Namco notes : The engineers who created Pole Position knew they had created something special when a steering wheel was first connected to the prototype game in their lab. Later, when Pole Position was released, engineers visiting the arcades found that the waiting lines were so long that they curled back and forth within the arcade and then extended out the door.[CR]Pole Position is widely cursed by collectors as having the worst hardware design of any arcade game released in the 1980s. Internal documents that have recently surfaced bear this fact out. The circuit board underwent a large number of modifications and design changes that, while finally allowing the game to function, made the boards fragile. Proof can be found by the piles of Pole Position video PCBs with burnt edge connectors sitting on collectors' workbenches. Working replacement Pole Position PCBs are very hard to find these days, and almost all of the known repair shops won't even look at them, much less attempt to fix them.[CR]Les Lagier holds the official record for this game with 67,310 points.[CR]A Pole Position cockpit model appears in the 1983 movie 'Joysticks'.[CR]A Pole Position upright model appears in the Judas Priest music video 'Freewheel Burning'. The gameplay shows the head of Rob Halford (lead singer) in the player's car.[CR][B]Scoring[/B][CR]Points are scored for every foot of track driven. [CR]At the end of the game, 50 points are scored for each car the driver passed. [CR]Finishing the game awards 200 points for each second left on the timer. [CR]Qualifying Lap Placement Bonus : [CR](Qualifying times vary depending on the 'Practice Rank' dip switch setting)[CR]Pole Position (1st place) : 4,000 points [CR]2nd place : 2,000 points [CR]3rd place : 1,400 points [CR]4th place : 1,000 points [CR]5th place : 800 points [CR]6th place : 600 points [CR]7th place : 400 points [CR]8th place : 200 points[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Hints for Game Play : [CR]1) Avoid puddles and the sides of the track because these slow you down. [CR]2) Accelerate before the green light appears, and stay ahead of other racers. [CR]3) Drive to the inside of the track to make the corners. [CR]4) Successful completion of a turn depends on braking skill. [CR]5) Engine sound will cue the driver when to shift to high gear.[CR]6) When sliding, steer into the skid. [CR]* Instead of pressing down on the gas pedal for acceleration, placing your foot underneath the gas pedal and lifting the pedal up with your instep caused the car to go even faster.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

		<plot>Cruis'n USA (c) 1994 Midway.[CR]Designed by the legendary Eugene Jarvis (creator of, among other things, "Robotron" and "Defender"), Cruis'n USA is a point-to-point racing game featuring fourteen separate courses set in a number of different US locations.[CR]Each race takes place against nine other rival cars. In addition to the player's opponents, the roads are packed with civilian traffic that must be avoided. Any collision with either other vehicles or with trackside objects will result in lost time as the player races against both the clock and the nine rival racers. On many tracks, collisions can be avoided by driving off-road, although this has as inverse effect on both handling and speed.[CR]The in-game physics are skewed entirely toward arcade-style handling.

		<plot>Out Run (c) 1986 Sega Enterprises, Limited.[CR]Out Run is a ground-breaking racing game in which the player drives a red Ferrari Testarossa through a number of colourful European locations, trying to reach each end-of-level checkpoint before the tight time limit expires.[CR]Each of the game's stages is packed with civilian traffic that must be carefully avoided, as players try to negotiate the game's twisting, hilly roads. [CR]At the end of every stage players are presented with a fork in the road, allowing them to chose which route they wish to take next. This was not the first time this feature had appeared (Tatsumi's 1983 racer, TX-1, was the first to introduce forked roads).[CR]As well as being able to choose routes, players could also - via the game's "in-car radio" - choose one of three different catchy tunes to listen to while driving. The songs are 'Magical Sound Shower', 'Passing Breeze' and 'Splash Wave'.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR][1] Standard Type[CR][2] Upright Type[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Released internationally on September 20, 1986.[CR]Also released as:[CR]"Out Run [Deluxe Type]".[CR]At the end of each stage, before the end-of-stage goal is reached, players are presented with a fork in the road; a unique innovation that, for the first time in the history of racing games, gave players a choice of which route they wished to take through the game. Out Run's game-play was both tight and instinctive and, together with the superb stage design and wonderfully realized sprite-scaled graphics, would completely revolutionize not just racing games, but arcade games in general.[CR]Out Run is still regarded as perhaps the finest arcade racer (and certainly the finest sprite-driven racer) of all time. This was especially true of the deluxe cabinet version, which featured a fully hydraulic tilting cabinet (resembling a red Ferrari Testarossa) and a powerful speaker system situated directly behind the player's head. The sublime music still captivates many fans today, although the sublime 'Magical Sound Shower' is generally regarded as the finest of the three in-game tunes on offer (the others being 'Passing Breeze' and 'Splash Wave'). The final tune, 'Last Wave', is only played when the high-score table is displayed.[CR]At least part of Out Run's huge success was down to it capturing the fun-yet-superficial spirit of the 1980s. Previous racing games had concentrated on the more serious side of racing, with the action usually taking place in a Formula One racing car, over a series of competent but uninspiring racing tracks. Out Run was different; in a decade that celebrated style over content, the game offered players the ultimate boy racer experience by putting them behind the wheel of that eighties icon of cool, a red Ferrari Testarossa; replete with a 'blonde bimbo' in the passenger seat.[CR]Sega didn't actually have (nor indeed ask for) permission from Ferrari to use one of their cars for the game. This inevitably led to a degree of bad feeling and threats of litigation between the two companies. They have since settled their differences, however, as Sega acquired an official license to use the Ferrari range in its 2003 sequel, "Out Run 2".[CR]Opponent cars list :[CR]* 1972 Volkswagen Beetle[CR]* 1971 Chevrolet Corvette[CR]* 1985 Porsche Carrera 911 Turbo[CR]* 1985 BMW 325i Cabriolet E30[CR]* Lorry[CR]Out Run contains in-game billboards advertising KTM motorcycles.[CR]Richard Jackson holds the official record for this game with 52,897,690 points.[CR]In the film 'Donnie Darko', Donnie is playing Out Run at an arcade with his girlfriend. The scene shows him crashing his car during their discussion.[CR]An Out Run cabinet can be seen in the 1988 educational video presented by General Motors called 'The Game Of Your Life'.[CR]A MTV public announcement against drunk driving shown in the mid '90s shows a gamer in their viewpoint playing Out Run whilst under the influence of alcohol and cuts to each point where the gamer crashes until the end of game.[CR]Soundtracks:[CR][JP] Dec. ??, 1987 - Sega Taikan Game Special [28XA-198][CR][JP] Feb. ??, 1992 - Outrun/SEGA S.S.T.

When you choose one of the roads and the other one disappears from view, a secret credit message will come up on the screen.[CR]* Instead of just pressing the accelerator all the way when you're about to start, you should instead try to keep the gas in 'the high greens' and just below red. The exact moment the green light goes on you should give it as much gas as possible thereby starting up much faster. Instead of shifting at approx. 170mph you should change gears at about 120 mph to avoid slowdown. This hint earns you approx. 1 second. This trick works every time you have to start from 0 mph but is difficult to time right when you don't have the green light for timing.[CR]* The second before going off road you can change very quickly to low gear and then high gear again. If done correctly you can drive off the road without any slowdown for about 1-2 seconds. If you time it right you can actually change to low then high again after the 1-2 seconds and not loose ANY speed whatsoever when driving offroad. This way you can keep going 292mph even though you're offroad.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1. Out Run (1986, Arcade)[CR]2. Out Run 3-D (1989, Master System) [CR]3.

		<plot>Super Hang-On (c) 1987 Sega.[CR]Super Hang-On is a checkpoint-based racing game and is the sequel to the acclaimed "Hang-On", released two years earlier. As with the prequel, players take control of a superbike and must race over twisting road-based circuits, avoiding rival bikers and trying to reach the end-of-stage checkpoint before the time limit expires.[CR]For the sequel, Sega introduced the hilly, undulating roads that had been executed so superbly in 1986's "Out Run". The gameplay was further enhanced with the introduction of the 'turbo' button. Upon reaching the bike's maximum speed of 280kph, players could press and hold the turbo and push the bike up to 324kph - something that was necessary to beat the game's extremely tight time limits. This had to be used carefully, however, as the increase in speed made the bike harder to control and accelerating at the wrong time would invariably see a head-on collision with either rival bikers or the road-side objects that litter the stages.[CR]Players could chose to race on any one of four courses: Africa, Asia, America and Europe. Africa is the easiest and shortest of the four, with each subsequent course becoming both more demanding - with tighter bends and more aggressive rival racers - and having a greater number of stages to have to beat. Africa, for example, is made up of only six stages, while the hardest course, Europe, has eighteen stages.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR][1] Mini Ride-On Type[CR][2] Sit-Down Type[CR][3] Upright Type: It has an actual motorcycle handlebar, throttle and break lever.

		<plot>Chase H.Q. (c) 1988 Taito Corp.[CR]"Chase H.Q." is a checkpoint-based racing game in which the player takes on the role on an undercover cop called Tony Gibson in this 'Miami Vice' inspired game from Taito. Gibson drives a powerful unmarked police car (resembling a Porsche 911) along with his partner, 'Raymond Broady' and must chase down and apprehend various criminals.[CR]The player has between fifty-five and seventy seconds (depending on the game's 'Dip' settings) to catch up with the fleeing criminal, then the same time period again to repeatedly ram into the criminal's car until it is too damaged to drive. The criminal's car is constantly moving away, so if the player repeatedly crashes or drives too slowly, the criminal will escape and the game ends.[CR]As with Sega's seminal "Out Run", "Chase H.Q." features forked junctions offering players a choice of routes. In this game, however, the route selected is only a temporary diversion and dictates how quickly the criminal is caught up with. The player's Porsche is equipped with a limited number of turbo boosts, when used a turbo boost pushes the car to incredible speeds, at the expense of control. The turbos must be used wisely if the player is to have a chance of capturing the criminal before the time limit expires.[CR]The game consists of five levels, each with its own villain to capture.[CR]The game's villains and the cars they drive are:[CR]1. Ralph, the Idaho Slasher (White Lotus Esprit)[CR]2. Carlos, the New York armed robber (Yellow Lamborghini Countach)[CR]3. Chicago pushers (Grey Porsche 959)[CR]4.

		<plot>Toobin' (c) 1988 Atari Games Corp.[CR]Toobin' is a unique fantasy-adventure game. 1 or 2 players can race Bif and Jet, the Toobin' dudes, in their inner tubes, down 45 different rivers. The players try to keep Jet and Bif afloat, avoiding sharp objects, gaining points, and throwing cans at obstacles. Toobin' appeals to both males and females of all ages who both find it just 'fun to play'.[CR]Toobin' has a continuous buy-in feature so players can join in at any time. Toobin' has a color-coded control panel and players can identify Jet in the yellow inner tube and Bif in the black inner tube and red shorts.[CR]Each player has a set of four buttons to steer Bif or Jet forwards, backwards, and sideways. Pressing the two Paddle Forward buttons moves the inner tube forward. Pressing the two Back Paddle buttons moves the inner tube backwards. Pressing only one Paddle button makes the inner tube turn. The player uses the Throw Can button to destroy obstacles in the river and stun riverside pests.[CR]Toobin' players can enjoy amusing game play and an incredible variety of rivers and environments for their long-term enjoyment.[CR]The player races Bif or Jet against other players, or against the game, down Toobin's 45 different rivers, paddling through six classes of play, and cruising the 15 unique river environments. The player can choose almost 200 courses through the rivers, finding his own way through rapids, obstacles, riverside pests and waterfalls.[CR]The player has to guide Bif or Jet around obstacles, go through gates and pick up treasure to accumulate points to get more inner tube patches, collect cans to throw at obstacles and to stun riverside pests, and paddle fast enough to avoid the big 'gator lurking in all the rivers.[CR]At the finish line, players are treated to a party. Each party grows in size until the player reaches the final super party at the end of the game.[CR]Inner-Tube Patches : At the beginning of each game, the player has a certain number of inner-tube patches, which represent game lives. A player receives extra patches by scoring the number of points required for another patch. The number of points required changes from level to level, and is displayed in the lower left and right corners of the playfield. A player can also receive more patches by picking up patches floating in the rivers.[CR]Cans : The player must accumulate cans to throw at obstacles and pests. All cans are the same value. The player can pick up individual cans floating in all the rivers or six-packs hidden under obstacles or in back waters (Six packs give unlimited cans). The player throws the cans by pointing Bif or Jet at the obstacle and pressing the Throw Can button.[CR]Most of the obstacles in the river can be eliminated by hitting them with a can.[CR]Dangers : The player must avoid or eliminate dangers in the river and stun pests on the river banks. The dangers in the river include falling rocks, floating logs, deadly falling coconuts, icebergs, mines, stampeding cattle, snakes, crocodiles, barbed wire, and thorny bushes.[CR]Dangerous riverside pests throw and shoot objects at Bif and Jet. The player can stun most of these objectionable characters with a can thrown in their direction. These pests include Casting fishermen, Hillbillies, Terrorists, Devils, Martians, Street punks, Pistolaros, Natives, Penguins, Bears, Dinosaurs, and Cavemen.[CR]Big 'Gator : If a player is slow, the big 'gator comes up from behind to discourage slow play and hurry the player through the gates. A loud thumping sound warns the player of its presence. One escape from the big 'gator is to quickly paddle downstream or pass through a gate. If the gator catches Bif or Jet, one inner-tube patch is lost.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Game ID : 136061[CR]Main CPU : Motorola 68010 (@ 8 Mhz), MOS Technology 6502 (@ 1.7895 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : Yamaha YM2151 (@ 3.579 Mhz), POKEY (Pot Keyboard Integrated Circuit) (@ 1.7895 Mhz)[CR]Players : 2[CR]Buttons : 5[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Toobin' was released in June 1988.[CR]1500 units were produced in the USA. The selling price was $2395. This was an unique cabinet (as did many Atari games of the time) that featured a large marquee behind which were two rotating drums, designed to give the impression of a flowing waterfall.[CR]Toobin' was a classic example of Atari's genius approach to abstract game design, that would typify their heyday of the mid-to-late 80s.[CR]The default high score screen of "Cyberball 2072" features names of many Atari arcade games, including TOOBIN.[CR]Special Contest Feature : Every Toobin' game in the U.S. has a special contest. A player can win a free Toobin' t-shirt just for playing the game and finding and picking up all seven characters to spell the word Toobin' (including the apostrophe). These characters are hidden in the river below obstacles and hazards. The letters collected by the player are shown at the beach party at the end of the run.

The player receives points for passing through the gates in the river. Different colored gates are worth different amounts of points. The green gates give the lowest points, then the red, gold, and finally crystal gates give the highest points.[CR]If a players swishes a gate, that is, paddles through it without hitting the poles, he adds to his Score Multiplier (This is described in Score Multiplier below). For maximum points, the player should be the first through the gate and swish the gate. Each time the gate poles are hit, the point value of the gate falls.[CR]*  Score Multiplier. If a player swishes the gate, the score is multiplied. Each gate that is swished adds to the multiplier. For example, if the player has a 2X multiplier, each point scored is multiplied by 2.[CR]Every point the player scores is multiplied by the score multiplier. The score multiplier is shown in the upper left and right of the playfield, underneath the game scores. The minimum multiplier is 1 and the maximum is 5. The player must pass through every gate (whether he swishes it or not) to maintain the score multiplier. If the player misses a gate, the score multiplier is reduced by one. As long as the player passes through the gate, even if he bumps it, the score multiplier is maintained. However, if a player's tube is punctured, his score multiplier falls to one.[CR]*  Treasures. The player can pick up treasures floating on the river or hidden under obstacles to gain extra points. The lowest-value treasure is green, next is red, and gold is the highest.[CR]*  Warp. The warp feature moves the player to the intermediate or advanced play classes. When the player warps, he is rewarded with warp bonus points. Warping is a good way to quickly score points.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* When you pick up a six-pack of cans, it's possible to park yourself close to a non-player character and rack up points by hitting them with the cans. The faster you are the better, so the beachball speed-up can be a big help here. [CR]* When the alligator comes to eat you (because you're taking too long to progress down the river) just hit him with one of the cans. This also works for certain other obstacles such as the floating mines (seeking or non-seeking). If you are quick enough, you can re-destroy the same mine several times and release multiple bonuses such as letters, treasures, sixpacks, etc. You can only throw one can at a time so any can already thrown will disappear once you press throw again.[CR]* Collect as many points as possible and try to push your opponent into obstacles. Swish up to five gates in a row and you will correspondingly advance your score multiplier (very important). Basic gates start at 2000, 1000, 500, 250. Once passed through the gates will decrease in points until they reach 100. Swishing a gate and then bumping it numerous times before your opponent can pass is an effective move. Pick-up cans (you can carry up to 9 at a time) or a sixpack (which gives you unlimited cans). The cans are used as "ammo" to hinder your opponent, stun other game characters, or to destroy certain obstacles (some obstacles are only temporarily destroyed). When you have a blowout you lose your sixpack and your score multiplier resets to 1. Your multiplier will go down each time you miss a gate.[CR]* Obstacles in the water (icebergs, bushes, mines, etc.) can reveal hidden points, sixpacks, patches (extra life), beachballs (speedup), including the fabled colorful letters. These letters are worth 10,000 points a piece. Try to have your score multiplier as high as possible to maximize the letter bonus at the end of each class. Be on the lookout for the 25,000 point gate since swishing it can give you up to 125,000 points if your score multiplier is 5! Unlike the other gates however, you only get one chance at the 25,000. Also be on the lookout for falling rocks, jumping penguins, submarines with nasty torpedoes, etc. On the first and second start gate you can utilize the warp whirlpool that will send you to a higher class. Many non-player characters chase you along the way. Watch out for the alligator, he likes to come out when you stall and he always comes from the top of the screen. You must go through a gate to repel that alligator before he appears or before he gets you.[CR]* A simple way to get a very high score : In only a minute or so, there's a way you can rack up over a million points. On Class 1, after going towards the first gate, direct your innertube to the right-hand side of the screen. You should see a sign that says 'This Way to Class 2' and a whirlpool should appear next to it. Shoot the twigs in front of the entrance and paddle back up. You will now be at the start of Class 2. Immediately move to the right of the screen, the same sign will appear, only this one warps you to Class 3. Shoot the iceberg in front, paddle back up and end up on class 3. The best part about the warps is that after each one, you get 600,000 points each. That's 1,200,000+ for doing very little work. An added bonus is that you will have four patches left in reserve thanks to the excess points you will have accumulated.[CR][B]Staff[/B][CR]Game designer : Milt Loper[CR]Game programmer : Dennis Harper[CR]Support programmers : Gary Stark, Russel Dawe (Rusty)[CR]Animators : Will Noble, Mark West, Deborah Short[CR]Audio : Brad Fuller, Hal Canon[CR]Engineers : Gary Stempler, Doug Snyder[CR]Technician : Dave Wiebenson[CR][B]Game Ports[/B][CR]* Consoles : [CR]Atari 7800 [US] (unreleased prototype)[CR]Nintendo NES [US] (1989)[CR]Sony PlayStation [US] (September 30, 1999) "Arcade Party Pak [Model SLUS-00952]"[CR]Sony PlayStation [EU] (February 23, 2001) "Arcade Party Pak [Model SLES-02339]" [CR]Sony PlayStation 2 [US] (November 18, 2003) "Midway Arcade Treasures [Model SLUS-20801]" [CR]Microsoft XBOX [US] (November 24, 2003) "Midway Arcade Treasures" [CR]Nintendo GameCube [US] (December 18, 2003) "Midway Arcade Treasures [Model DOL-GAKE-USA]" [CR]Microsoft XBOX [EU] (February 6, 2004) "Midway Arcade Treasures" [CR]Sony PlayStation 2 [EU] (February 6, 2004) "Midway Arcade Treasures [Model SLES-51927]" [CR]Microsoft XBOX 360 [US] (November 6, 2012) "Midway Arcade Origins" [CR]Sony PlayStation 3 [US] (November 6, 2012) "Midway Arcade Origins [Model BLUS-31083]"[CR]Microsoft XBOX 360 [EU] (November 15, 2012) "Midway Arcade Origins" [CR]Sony PlayStation 3 [EU] (November 15, 2012) "Midway Arcade Origins [Model BLES-01768]"[CR]* Handhelds : [CR]Nintendo Game Boy Color [US] (May 18, 2000) "Toobin' [Model CGB-AOIE-USA]" [CR]Sony PSP [US] (December 13, 2005) "Midway Arcade Treasures Extended Play [Model ULUS-10059]"[CR]Sony PSP [EU] (February 24, 2006) "Midway Arcade Treasures Extended Play [Model ULES-00180]" [CR]* Computers : [CR]MSX [EU] (1988) [CR]Amstrad CPC [EU] (1989) [CR]Commodore C64 [US] [EU] (1989) [CR]Commodore Amiga [EU] (1989) [CR]Atari ST [EU] (1989) [CR]Sinclair ZX Spectrum [EU] (1989) [CR]PC [MS-DOS] [US] (1992) [CR]PC [MS Windows, CD-ROM] [US] (August 27, 2004) "Midway Arcade Treasures" [CR]PC [MS Windows, CD-ROM] [EU] (November 23, 2004) "Midway Arcade Treasures"[CR]</plot>

		<plot>Road Blasters (c) 1987 Atari Games.[CR]Road Blasters is a futuristic driving game in which the player must shoot rival racers and collect fuel globes to top up his ever-diminishing fuel supply. Power-up weapons are dropped from above and and must be 'caught' by the player. Collision with enemy vehicles will result in the destruction of the player's own vehicle. Digitized speech, effects and music play throughout the game.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR][Upright model][CR]Game ID : 136048[CR]Runs on the "Atari System 1" hardware.[CR]Players: 1[CR]Control: dial[CR]Buttons: 3[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Road Blasters was released in March 1987.[CR]2,906 Upright units were produced in the USA.[CR]Also released as "Road Blasters [Sit-Down model]".[CR]For a limited period after the game's release, players could win a free Atari T-shirt by completing all 50 levels. [CR]Road Blasters was the last of the Atari System 1 games made. The original name of Road Blasters during its design was 'Future Vette'.[CR]This game appears, on the 2012 animation movie "Wreck-It Ralph" from Walt Disney Animation Studios.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Shoot cars using a single shot instead of holding down the fire button to increase the bonus multiplier.[CR]* Crash into roadside cannons instead of shooting them for 8,000+ points. This will greatly increase reserve fuel, which is awarded at the end of a rally based on score.[CR]* If you crash your car into one of the turrets at the side of the road, you'll get 8-10x the current value of a turret. When your score multiplier is up to 10, this is 16,000 - 20,000 points! Early on, keep your score multiplier high and always crash into at least two of these babies every board and finishing the game (or doing very well at it) is not tough. After a while it gets hard to crash into two turrets every board and still finish the board on time.[CR]* Tip For Strategies On Level 49 and 50 : Since level 50 is the last level, and the game gives you a complete recharge at the end of 49, accuracy doesn't count any more.

		<plot>Cruis'n World (c) 1996 Midway Mfg. Co.[CR]Cruis'n World is a direct sequel to "Cruis'n USA", and is again a point-to-point racing game, with each race having the player racing against nine rival drivers.[CR]Unlike its USA-set prequel, Cruis'n World's races take place in a variety of global locations, such as the Egypt, London and France. Players can race in any one of twelve countries ranked by difficulty, or drive the entire world through fourteen tracks.[CR]While the core gameplay remains the same, new time-saving stunt moves have been introduced in the form of wheelies and jumps, and many tracks now feature short-cuts.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Midway V Unit hardware[CR]Main CPU : TMS32031 (@ 50 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU : ADSP2105 (@ 10 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : DMA-driven (@ 10 Mhz)[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : paddle[CR]Buttons : 6[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Released in November 1996.[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]Revision 1 :[CR]* Software version : 1.3.[CR]* Build date : ???[CR]Revision 2 :[CR]* Software version : 1.7.[CR]* Build date : ???[CR]Revision 3 :[CR]* Software version : 1.9.[CR]* Build date : ???[CR]Revision 4 :[CR]* Software version : 2.0.[CR]* Build date : TUE MAR 18 12 :32 :57 1997[CR]Revision 5 :[CR]* Software version : 2.3.[CR]* Build date : FRI JAN 09 10 :25 :49 1998[CR]Revision 6 :[CR]* Software version : 2.4.[CR]* Build date : ???[CR]Revision 7 :[CR]* Software version : 2.5.[CR]* Build date : ???[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Hidden Cars : Hold View 1 or View 2 at the car selection screen to access two sets of hidden cars.

If you do it right you should still be pulling a wheelie when you hit the car you are jumping over and will not crash. [CR]* Wheelie and Turbo Boost : To pop a wheelie and gain some acceleration, double-tap the gas while driving. NOTE : If you're playing in Manual mode, you can also do this by switching from fourth gear to neutral and back.[CR]* Ride on 2 Wheels : To race on 2 wheels, double-tap the gas while turning a corner.[CR]* Back Flip : When you are going up a hill, do a wheelie at the top. [CR]* Side Flip : Do a wheelie while turning, then press in the opposite direction of your turn to flip on your side.[CR]* Honk your Horn : While racing, press Start to honk your horn. The Humvee will fire it's machine gun if you do this.[CR]* Short Cut in Hawaii : Before the tunnel you'll see construction cones. Go through them on the forest side and it'll take you up a 2-track and off a cliff.[CR]* Shortcut in China : When racing in China, you will find a break in the sides of the wall. Hit the gas and cut your wheel. It will take you through the break in the wall and across a country road before rejoining the game ahead of your competition.[CR]* Shortcut in New York : The shortcut through the Big Apple is on the third exit through a construction zone![CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

		<plot>Pole Position II (c) 1983 Namco, Ltd. [CR]Pole Position II is a 1-player game using a color raster-scan video display. Game action takes place at four different raceways - the Fuji Speedway in Japan, the Test Track (an oval track like Indy), the Seaside Speedway (with the Long Beach Pike in the background), and the Suzuka Speedway in Japan. The unique and picturesque scenery around each raceway adds exciting realism to each race! [CR]The player drives a Formula-1 race car on each track. The first objective of the game is to finish the qualifying lap as quickly as possible. If the player beats the time, he or she qualifies for the race. If not, he or she drives the remainder of his time along the qualifying course. [CR]As a qualifier, the player is ranked according to his or her qualifying lap time, from the 1st (pole) position to 8th. The second objective of the game is to race against the clock and other cars to finish the specified number of laps ('Nr. of Laps' dip switch setting; 3 laps is the default) of the race as fast as possible, and to achieve the highest score possible. The player earns points for passing cars, driving on the track, and finishing the race with time remaining. The player is rewarded with an extended-play lap for completing the first lap within a certain amount of time (depending on the 'Extended Rank' dip switch setting). [CR]To start play, the player must first insert the correct number of coin(s) for a game (according to the coin dip switch settings, 1 coin/1 credit is the default for both 'Coin A' and 'Coin B' dips). The player then turns the steering wheel until the track he or she wants to drive on is highlighted in white. The game starts when the player steps on the accelerator. The player's car will appear behind the starting line and a certain amount of time, in seconds ('Game Time' dip switch setting; the default is 90 seconds), will be on the clock. The player's car must finish the qualifying lap within a certain amount of time (which varies depending on the 'Practice Rank' dip switch setting) to be in the race. If the player does not qualify, his or her car continues on the track until the 'Game Time' elapses. [CR]If the player has qualified, just before the race begins, the player's car (flashing on the screen) is placed at the starting line with seven other cars. The position of the car depends on the position earned during the qualifying lap. (The player's car is always placed at the 8th position in the attract mode.) [CR]The starting lights flash from red to green, and the race begins. Racing hazards are other racing cars, sharp turns, water puddles, and road signs. (All of these hazards except for water puddles are also present on the qualifying lap.) As the race progresses, more cars appear on the track. If the player's car hits another car or a road sign, it is destroyed in an explosion (Pole Position II adds flying debris to the visual effect). The player's car reappears in a few seconds and the race continues. Driving through water puddles or off the track slows down the player's car even more than in the original "Pole Position". [CR]Experience will teach the player which turns on which tracks require slight steering (because they're banked) and which turns require fast and forceful steering. The player jockeys for position with the other racers, while keeping his or her eye on the clock at the top of the screen. When time runs out, the race is over. If the player has beaten the racing lap time and has seconds remaining, the remaining seconds are added to the extended lap time, which varies depending on the track and the 'Extended Rank' dip switch setting. [CR]The top score achieved by a player appears at the top of the screen. The time allotted for the lap is displayed under the top score. Increasing lap time (in seconds and hundredths of a second) and the speed of the car appear last. Each track has its own separate high score list.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR][Upright model] [CR]Game ID : PP2 [CR]Main CPU : Zilog Z80 (also drives the sound), Zilog Z8002 (x2) [CR]Sound Chips : Namco 6-channel stereo WSG, DAC (engine sound), discrete circuitry (crash and skid sounds), custom DAC (speech) [CR]Players : 1 [CR]Controls : Steering wheel, gear shifter (Hi and Low) [CR]Pedals : Accelerator only[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Pole Position II was released in October 1983 in Japan. [CR]Lloyd Dahling holds the official record for this game on the 'Fuji' track with 75,390 points. [CR]Jeff Peters holds the official record for this game on the 'Seaside' track with 75,390 points. [CR]Jeff Peters also holds the official record for this game on the 'Suzuka' track with 75,660 points. [CR]Jeff Peters also holds another official record for this game on the 'Test' track with 81,870 points.[CR][B]Scoring[/B][CR]Points are scored for every foot of track driven. [CR]At the end of the game, 50 points are scored for each car the driver passed. [CR]Finishing the game awards 200 points for each second left on the timer. [CR]Qualifying Lap Placement Bonus : [CR](Qualifying times vary depending on both the track and the 'Practice Rank' dip switch setting) [CR]Pole Position (1st place) : 4,000 points [CR]2nd place : 2,000 points [CR]3rd place : 1,400 points [CR]4th place : 1,000 points [CR]5th place : 800 points [CR]6th place : 600 points [CR]7th place : 400 points [CR]8th place : 200 points[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Hints for Game Play : [CR]1) Avoid puddles and the sides of the track because these slow you down. In Pole Position II, puddles slow you down even more than in the original "Pole Position".[CR]2) Accelerate before the green light appears, and stay ahead of other racers. [CR]3) Drive to the inside of the track to make the corners. [CR]4) Do not over steer (tracks are banked). [CR]5) Engine sound will cue the driver when to shift to high gear. [CR]6) When sliding, steer into the skid. [CR]7) Drive over water puddles at 370 km/h (230 mph), and you will have turbo charge power. [CR]* Easter Egg :[CR]1) Enter service mode.[CR]2) Turn wheel to 04; Change the shifter from LO to HI.[CR]3) Turn wheel to 45; Change the shifter from LO to HI.[CR]4) Turn wheel to 55; Change the shifter from LO to HI.[CR]5) Turn wheel to 56; Change the shifter from LO to HI.[CR]6) Turn wheel to 91; Change the shifter from LO to HI.[CR]'(c) 1982 NAMCO LTD.' will appear on the screen.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

		<plot>Out Runners (c) 1992 Sega.[CR]Between 1 and 8 players (the latter requiring the use of link-up cabinets) compete in this colourful update of the 1986 classic, "Out Run". Out Runners features the multiple routes of the original but this time includes a large number of selectable vehicles; each of which poses different strengths and weaknesses, such as higher speed or better handling. Out Runners captures of the spirit of Out Run adding characters, humour, numerous selectable soundtracks (including a radio broadcast of the race by Jake Elwood) and a seamless driving experience barely interrupted by crashes.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Sega System Multi 32 hardware[CR]Main CPU : V70 (@ 20 Mhz), Zilog Z80 (@ 8.053975 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : YM3438 (@ 8.053975 Mhz), MultiPCM (@ 8.053975 Mhz)[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : paddle[CR]Buttons : 5[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Even if titlescreen says 1992, OutRunners was released in May 1993 in Japan.[CR]The name of the DJ (Jake Elwood) is a combination of the names of the main characters (Joliet 'Jake' and 'Elwood' Blues) in the 1980 film 'The Blues Brothers'.[CR]"Magical Sound Shower", "Passing Breeze" and "Splash Wave" are the original Out Run soundtracks that can also be found in 'Out Runners' - albeit in 'enhanced' form.[CR]A hugely impressive game CV by anyone's standards.[CR]Toshiba EMI released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Virtua Racing &amp; Out Runners - TYCY-5365) on 15/12/1993.[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]The US version is slightly different, It has the 'Winners Don't Use Drugs' on one screen and the 'Recycle It, Don't Trash It!' on the other screen.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* To play Jingle Bells as the background music, you must first start a race. Any time during the race hit the next music station and previous music station at the same time.[CR]* To enter your name to the Best 'Out Runners' rankings, win the game before the clock runs out.[CR]* Each car has its own number of gears for Manual transmission ranging from two to six. Also note that manual transmission cars on the arcade version have higher top speeds and each car has its own strengths and weaknesses. The Bad Boy Being the quickest, Wild Chaser being able to drive faster off road, Quick Reactor having the best handling, The Road Monster slows down less when crashing into other vehicles on the road and Mad Power being the fastest car in the game. Speed Buster had slow acceleration but better handling and the same top speed as Mad Power while Easy Handling and Smooth Operator are just overall great cars.[CR]As far as the home port goes, there are just a few things different. Speed Buster is the best regular car on the game and can run low 4m30sec times via Australia while Mad Power Can Run high 4min30s. Wild Chaser when off road will rapidly accelerate from 263mph-283mph unlike the arcade where the car stays steady at 274mph Mad Power can hit a top speed of 308mph with the manual transmission by downshifting into 5th gear at 293mph. You can also downshift at 274mph but you will top out at 306mph. The Virtua Formula Car can be unlocked on the Japanese and some early versions of the game by entering a cheat. One the title screen, take controller one and enter this code: LEFT, RIGHT, LEFT, RIGHT, B, C, A. You'll hear a noise if it worked. Press START and choose the Arcade Mode with button C. To the left of the first car is the Virtua Formula. This is by far the best car in the game. it also has the same top speed as Mad Power and the downshifting trick works on her as well.[CR]Acceleration Times With Manual Transmissions and Top Speed[CR]Easy Handling: 0-60mph 2.72sec 0-100mph 4.48sec 0-150mph 6.80sec 0-200mph 8.94sec 0-250mph 12.47sec Top Speed 274mph Transmission 5 speed[CR]The Bad Boy: 0-60mph 1.66sec 0-100mph 2.82sec 0-150mph 3.74sec 0-200mph 4.52sec 0-250mph 5.54sec Top Speed 272mph Transmission 2 speed[CR]Smooth Operator: 0-60mph 2.72sec 0-100mph 4.55sec 0-150mph 6.66sec 0-200mph 8.67sec 0-250mph 12.30sec Top Speed 274mph Transmission 2 speed[CR]Wild Chaser: 0-60mph 3.02sec 0-100mph 4.89sec 0-150mph 6.49sec 0-200mph 8.16sec 0-250mph 10.57sec Top Speed 267mph on road 274mph off road Transmission 3 speed[CR]Quick Reactor: 0-60mph 1.46sec 0-100mph 2.58sec 0-150mph 4.25sec 0-200mph 5.95sec 0-250mph 8.97sec Top Speed 267mph Transmission 4 speed[CR]Road Monster: 0-60mph 3.02sec 0-100mph 4.79sec 0-150mph 6.76sec 0-200mph 8.80sec 0-250mph 12.37sec Top Speed 274mph Transmission 3 speed[CR]Speed Buster: 0-60mph 3.02sec 0-100mph 5.06sec 0-150mph 7.41sec 0-200mph 9.82sec 0-250mph 12.03sec Top Speed 299mph Transmission 2 speed[CR]Mad Power: 0-60mph 2.38sec 0-100mph 3.77sec 0-150mph 5.54sec 0-200mph 8.02sec 0-250mph 10.26sec Top Speed 299mph Transmission 6 speed[CR]Your acceleration times may differ.

		<plot>Hard Drivin' (c) 1988 Atari Games.[CR]Slide into the contoured seat and adjust it to fit the length of your arms and legs. Put your feet on gas and clutch pedals and try the stick shift. Select manual or automatic transmission, turn the ignition key and you're off![CR]It&#8217;s the ride of your life. You feel the tires grip the road when you take a wide turn at high speed. You're alerted to the smallest change in the road by the feedback steering. You catch air as you fly the draw bridge and land on the down ramp. You control the car as it holds the road on the dizzying vertical loop.[CR]Hard Drivin' might look like an arcade game but it drives like a real car. For the best lap times, drive Hard Drivin' as if it were a real car. The main difference between Hard Drivin' and a real car is that Hard Drivin' is much safer to drive. A player can test the limits of the car and his skill with no risk of personal injury, and follow a course that does not exist anywhere in the real world.[CR]After inserting the proper number of coins to start the simulator, the player can select either an automatic or manual transmission. Turning the ignition key starts the simulator.[CR]Drivers can choose between the stunt track or the speed track by following the posted signs on the road. Each player has a certain (operator-selectable) amount of time to reach a checkpoint or the finish line. Crossing checkpoints and the finish line rewards the player with (operator-selectable) bonus driving time.[CR]With Hard Drivin' a player can test drive a high-powered sports car on a real stunt course. He can jump a draw bridge, negotiate a high-speed banked turn and drive a 360-degree vertical loop. These thrilling stunts, among others, provide the ultimate realistic driving experience.[CR]Or maybe high-speed driving is a particular player's type of excitement. He can 'put the pedal to the metal' and try to keep control around the corners, weaving in and out of traffic while avoiding oncoming cars. All this, and more, await the player behind the wheel of Hard Drivin'.[CR]Players especially enjoy the unique instant replay feature on Hard Drivin'.  Every time a player crashes, the simulator records and replays the crash sequence. Not only will the player find this entertaining, but it is also informative. The instant replay shows the player exactly what he did wrong and why he crashed (If a player wants to skip the instant replay, he can press the abort switch or turn the key when the replay starts).[CR]A skilled player finds the ultimate competition in the 'challenge' lap (or 'grudge match' as Atari Games likes to call it). The simulator remembers the path of the car driven by the best driver on record.  When a player beats the qualifying lap time, he challenges the car of the past winner in a head-to-head race.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Cockpit model[CR]Game ID : 136052[CR]Main CPU : Motorola 68010 (@ 8 Mhz), TMS34010 (@ 6 Mhz), TMS34010 (@ 6.25 Mhz), ADSP2100 (@ 8 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU : Motorola 68000 (@ 8 Mhz), TMS32010 (@ 5 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : DAC[CR]Hard Drivin' is equipped with center-feel steering with continuous force feedback, adjustable swivel seat, gas, brake and clutch pedals, four-speed stick shift, and a medium-resolution monitor.[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Even if titlescreen says 1988, Hard Drivin' was released in February 1989. [CR]1668 units were produced in the USA and 200 in Ireland for European distribution. The selling price was $7995. [CR]This was the world first driving simulator to use 3-D polygon graphics. [CR]Despite claiming to be a real driving simulator, there were a lot of discrepancies between the game's software physics and the car physics on screen. However, the cockpit physics were considered very accurate at the time. [CR]You may have noticed that the Credit Screen lists Doug Milliken as a Test Driver (See Staff section). He is listed as a Test Driver because Atari didn't want anyone to know what he really did. Hard Drivin' had to be as accurate as possible. That meant doing an accurate car model to mathematically describe the physics of how the parts of the car (engine, transmission, springs, shock absorbers, tires, etc.) react to each other, to the road and to the driver's inputs. The pioneer in the field (in the 1950s) was William Milliken of Milliken Research. His son, Doug, has continued his father's work. Doug is probably the world's leading expert in car modelling. Doug and his father wrote the book on car modelling. [CR]Patents that come out of Hard Drivin' are : [CR]5005148 : 'Driving simulator with moving painted dashboard'. [CR]5354202 : 'System and method for driver training'. [CR]5577913 : 'System and method for driver training with multiple driver competition'. [CR]Prior to the release of Hard Drivin', Namco had acquired a controlling interest in Atari games by 1986. The sharing of R&amp;D information would spawn many games of the same polygon engine years later. It can be credited that the success of the Hard Drivin' engine set the trend for the high quality simulation games in the early 90's. [CR]One of the buildings along the speed course, a small camouflage-painted building, if approached from behind (a non-trivial task, given the off-road time limit) has a sign above its normally-unseen door that says 'THE HUT'. [CR]If the driver slowed down and stopped in front of one of the buildings, a 'keyhole' appeared on the building's door. [CR]There is no apparent Ferrari license shown in any version of the game. [CR]Jeff Garabedian holds the official record for this game with 531400 points at Aladdin's Castle at the Pontiac Mall in Waterford, MI in the summer of 1989. [CR]There were 15 officially released versions, counting 11 cockpit and 4 compact versions, including various British, German and Japanese versions.[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]Notes : In all British versions, you are in a right-hand drive car.[CR]COCKPIT Revision 1 :[CR]* World release.[CR]* Software version : 7.8.[CR]COCKPIT Revision 2 :[CR]* World release.[CR]* Software version : 7.9.[CR]COCKPIT Revision 3 :[CR]* World release.[CR]* Software version : 8.1.[CR]COCKPIT Revision 4 :[CR]* German release only.[CR]* Software version : 8.2.[CR]COCKPIT Revision 5 :[CR]* British release only.[CR]* Software version : 8.3.[CR]COCKPIT Revision 6[CR]* British and Japanese releases only.[CR]* Software version : 8.4 for Japanese and 8.5 for British.[CR]COCKPIT Revision 7[CR]* World, British and Japanese release.[CR]* Software version : 8.6 for all.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]If the driver made a hard left turn at the start of the game, a 'secret' track was available.

		<plot>Ironman Ivan Stewart's Super Off-Road (c) 1989 Leland Corporation. [CR]In his never ending quest for adventure and excitement, man invented off-road racing. These races were then brought before the masses by converting huge sports stadiums into dirt and mud obstacle courses in which off-road 'Ironmen' battled for top honors. [CR]Now the Leland Corporation brings this fast moving, hard driving sport to the video game arena. [CR]Ironman Ivan Stewart's Super Off-Road is stadium off-road racing at it's best. One to three players are asked to test their dirt track skills against the best dirt truck driver in the world. [CR]Contestants compete on eight different tracks with a total of 16 configurations and these courses are packed with enough jumps, bumps, hills, and holes to challenge even the most skillful driver. [CR]Winning drivers earn 'cash' prizes, and use this 'cash' to 'buff out' their machines. At the end of each race, players take their trucks to the 'Speed Shop' to buy better shocks, tires, engines, and higher top speed. They can also buy nitro packs to help them blast over the jumps and through the mud. [CR]The 'Convert-a-Credit' feature allows drivers to add to their winnings by using credits as 'cash'. Each additional quarter, when converted, becomes $200,000 in game 'cash' and this additional 'cash' may be used for purchases in the 'Speed Shop'.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Main CPU : (2x) Zilog Z80 (@ 6 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU : I80186 (@ 8 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : (2x) General Instrument AY8910 (@ 1.666 Mhz), Custom (@ 1.666 Mhz)[CR]Players : 3[CR]Control : dial[CR]Buttons : 1[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Ironman Ivan Stewart's Super Off-Road was released in April 1989. [CR]Ivan Ironman Stewart's Super Off-Road is the first arcade game to feature Dynamic Play Adjustment (DPA), the cpu would change the speed and skill of the grey car (supposedly Mr. Stewart himself) in relation to your performance in the game, in order to ensure high earnings and close contests. [CR]Ivan Stewart is a legend in Off-Road racing. He gained his nickname 'Ironman' as a result of competing in many marathon treks through the desert. Each time he won a Baja 500 or Baja 1000 race, held in the heat of Mexico, Stewart received an 'Ironman' award.

		<plot>NBA Jam (c) 1993 Midway Mfg. Co.[CR]Two-on-two basketball with digitized images of real NBA players, monster dunks and no referee - it's a blowout![CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Midway T Unit hardware[CR]Main CPU : TMS34010 (@ 6.25 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU : Motorola M6809 (@ 2 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : Yamaha YM2151 (@ 3.57958 Mhz), DAC, OKI6295 (@ 8 Khz)[CR]Players : 4[CR]Control : 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 3[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Released in February 1993. Many critics claim that the release of NBA Jam gave rise to a new genre of sports games, which were based around action-packed, unrealistic game-play.[CR]Midway Games, no stranger to releasing landmark games having released "Pac-Man", had started experimenting with the ideas two years earlier, with the "High Impact Football" series. Both High Impact and Super High Impact had somewhat average success in arcades. It was not until the release of NBA Jam that gamers noticed the new genre. The game became exceptionally popular, and generated a lot of money for arcades after its release, largely because of the fairly expensive prices put on these games; a game quarter generally took two credits and a full game generally took eight, typically equal to $2.00 USD. Nonetheless, the game was a smash hit.[CR]NBA Jam was one of the first real playable basketball arcade games (It was the first game to be officially licensed by the NBA (National Basketball Association)), and was also one of the first sports games to feature real teams, real players, and their real digitized likenesses. However, the unrealism of the game was the major drawing point, as the high flying dunks (often featuring players jumping twice their own height in the air while making highly acrobatic slams) were the games' signature. Of course, seeing NBA superstars like Hakeem Olajuwon, Karl Malone, David Robinson, Charles Barkley, and Shaquille O'Neal flying through the air with the greatest of ease brought just as many fans back. In time, players discovered another major feature of the game, as it was filled with easter eggs, special features and players activated by initials or button/joystick combinations.[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]Revision 1[CR]* Software version : 2.00.[CR]Revision 2 :[CR]* Software version 3.01.[CR]* Credit problems fixed.[CR]* Jersey color of special guests fixed.[CR]* Prevents games from ending at the Tank mini-game.[CR]* Added 'Fair Shake'.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Hidden Characters :[CR]Air Morris - WIL, Jan 1[CR]Carleton - JMC, Aug 5[CR]Divita - SAL, Feb 1 (Sal Divita did the artwork for NBA Jam, as well as some graphics work on Mortal Kombat)[CR]Goskie - TWG, Dec 7[CR]Hey - JWH, Sep 20 (On the design team screen, Jon Hey is the one in the checkered shirt and glasses, sticking his tongue out to the rest of the world)[CR]Howard - HOW, Jul 15[CR]Liptak - SL(space), Jun 24 (Shawn Liptak is the one on the design team screen with a basketball for a brain)[CR]Newcomer - JRN, Jun 18[CR]Oursler - SNO, Jan 3[CR]Petro - GNP, Oct 8 (George N.

		<plot>Track &amp; Field (c) 1983 Konami.[CR]Track &amp; Field is a multi-event sports game. Up to four players compete against each other in six track and field events in this legendary, genre creating and much-copied game from Konami. The game consists of two 'Run' buttons per player (one for each 'leg' of the athlete) and one action button.[CR]Only two players can compete simultaneously so on 3 and 4-player games, players have to wait their turn.[CR]An extra life is awarded for every 100000 points acquired.[CR]Each player must qualify in the current event before they can move on to the next.[CR]Hit the two 'Run' buttons to build up speed and use action button to jump or throw. [CR]The six events are : [CR]1) 100-meter Dash - Run as fast as possible. [CR]2) Long Jump - Run to the take-off board then choose angle of jump (42 is optimal). [CR]3) Javelin Throw - Run to the line then choose angle of throw (42 is optimal). [CR]4) 110-meter Hurdles - Run and time jumps over the hurdles. [CR]5) Hammer Throw - As the athlete spins faster and faster, time release of hammer and angle of throw (45 is optimal). [CR]6) High Jump - The athlete will run to the bar, just as he reaches it, use Action button to start the jump and hold down the action button to reduce the angle of climb, i.e. you start going straight up at 90 degrees if you tap the button just once. Use run buttons while in the air to gain extra height.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Game ID : GX361 [CR]Main CPU : Motorola M6809 (@ 2.048 Mhz) [CR]Sound CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 3.579545 Mhz) [CR]Sound Chips : DAC (@ 3.579545 Mhz), SN76496 (@ 1.789772 Mhz), Sanyo VLM5030 (@ 3.58 Mhz) [CR]Players : 4 [CR]Buttons : 3 [CR]= &gt; [1] Run (Left), [2] Jump/Throw, [3] Run (Right) [CR]Odd-numbered players (1 and 3) use the controls on the right side of the panel; even-numbered players (2 and 4) use the controls on the left side. [CR]In a 4-player game on an upright machine, players 1 and 3 share player 1's control; players 2 and 4 share player 2's control. [CR]On a cocktail machine, players 1 and 2 play from one end of the machine, while players 3 and 4 play from the opposite end. The screen's orientation will flip for each pair of players.[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Track &amp; Field was released in October 1983 by Konami. It was licensed to Centuri for US manufacture and distribution during the same month. [CR]Track &amp; Field proved to be incredibly successful for Konami, and would spawn countless imitations - particularly on the 8-bit home systems of the time - as well as three sequels of its own. One of the undoubted reasons for its success was the superb multi-player game, which, for perhaps the first time in the video arcade, introduced a genuine sense of rivalry among players and showed the gaming world what was truly possible with multi-player gaming. [CR]The song that is heard playing on the high score and awards screen is 'Chariots of Fire', written by Vangelis for the movie of the same name. [CR]This game is known in Japan as "Hyper Olympic". A Bootleg of this game called "Atlant Olimpic" was released in Italy in 1996, thirteen years after the game first appeared. [CR]A Track &amp; Field unit appears in the 1985 movie, 'The Goonies'.[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]Later versions of this game replace the two 'Run' buttons with a trackball.[CR][B]Scoring[/B][CR]Points are awarded in each event. The faster the time, the further or higher the jump, or the further you throw the more points you score.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* 100m Dash : Achieve exactly the same time for player 1 and 2 and 1000 point bonus will be awarded. [CR]* Long Jump : 3 jumps of exactly the same length will cause a little man with a key to run across the screen, awarding 1000 points. [CR]* Javelin : Throw the javelin off the top of the screen to bring down a bird for a 1000 point bonus. To do this you must achieve the 'maximum' angle. [CR]* 110m Hurdles : If both players finish the race in a dead heat then a little man with a key will run across the screen, awarding 1000 points to each player. [CR]* High Jump : Fail the first two jumps and then clear it; a mole burrows up for a 1000 point bonus. [CR]* Hint : When you alternate tapping the run buttons (run1, run2, run1, run2 etc.) you will get a much better speed increase. You have three attempts to qualify on all but the two running events. [CR]* BUG : In both Javelin and the Hammer Throw, throwing over 100m will cause a counter wraparound, so a 100m12 throw will be logged as 0m12 (and will not qualify you).[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

		<plot>Super Punch-Out!! (c) 1984 Nintendo.[CR]Super Punch-Out!! is an update of the superb boxing game, "Punch-Out!!", featuring five new larger-than-life opponents. The player once again assumes the role of a green-haired boxer who must fight his way up through five boxers to earn the title of 'Champ'. [CR]As with the original game, the player's boxer is viewed from behind with his torso rendered with wire-frame graphics (allowing the player's opponent to be easily seen). Punches, dodges and blocks must all be well-timed in order to defeat the opponent. [CR]Both the player and the opponent have stamina meters displayed at the top of the screen. These decrease when either boxer takes a punch and boxers will get knocked down if their stamina meter runs out completely. Faster knockdowns will cause the fallen boxer to recover less stamina upon getting up; the same happens if a boxer is knocked down by a knockout punch. [CR]Thanks to the refined roster of new and hugely distinctive enemy fighters, Super Punch-Out!! is considered to be an improvement over the first game.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Main CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 4 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU : Zetex N2A03 (@ 1.789772 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : Zetex N2A03 (@ 1.789772 Mhz), Sanyo VLM5030 (@ 3.58 Mhz)[CR]Players : 1[CR]Control : 4-way joystick (pull up on the joystick to duck)[CR]Buttons : 3[CR]=&gt; [1] LEFT BLOW, [2] RIGHT BLOW, [3] KNOCKOUT BLOW[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Super Punch-Out!! was released in September 1984 in the arcades.[CR]The image used for the background of "Punch-Out!!" (in which Mario, Luigi, DK and DK Jr. sit on both sides of the ring) was recycled for Super Punch-Out!!. The only difference is that the background is in black and white.[CR]Not to be confused with the 1994 Super NES game of the same name, 'Super Punch-Out!!', which is a remake of the arcade game to mark the ten-year anniversary of the original game's release.[CR]The game's title music, is actually the 'Gillette Look Sharp March'. This jingle, originally heard in Gillette radio and television commercials, was later used as the theme song to the Gillette Cavalcade of Sports, which aired boxing matches. The music can also be heard in the 1980 boxing related film 'Raging Bull' during the scene where Jake LaMotta (as played by Robert De Niro) unveils his new nightclub.[CR]Vodka Drunkenski's name would later be changed to 'Soda Popinski' for his appearances on the home console versions (see Series below) to remove alcoholic references and make the games more child-friendly.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Control Panel Instructions : [CR]- Power meter indicates your punching power. Build up your punching power by punching the champ, throw a knockout blow when meter flashes "KO".[CR]- Status meter indicates your/champ's respective stamina, knockdown occurs when status meter reads empty.[CR]- Game is over when you are knocked out or time counts down to zero.(1)[CR]- "Let's keep it clean. Now come out boxing!"[CR](1) Exception : In Super Punch-Out!!, time starts at zero and counts forward. When time reaches three minutes, time is up and the game is over.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

		<plot>2020 Super Baseball (c) 1991 SNK.[CR]There is no longer conventional baseball in 2020. The Super Baseball designed by the SUPER BASEBALL ASSOCIATION has been very popular and is the best sport. However, the truth is that the association has used a colossal sum of money to promote Super Baseball as show business. They have manipulated each player's ability using the control computer to secretly decide victory or defeat in every game. The players who knew this removed the connecting parts of the computer to play their own game of baseball.[CR]Finally, a fair game in going to be played at "CYBER EGG"![CR]FUTURISTIC SUPER BASEBALL, NOW PLAY BALL![CR]2020 Super Baseball:[CR]1. Futuristic Graphics[CR]2. Select 1 of 12 individual teams of men, women &amp; robot players.[CR]3. Fast paced game with new rules![CR]4.

Double plays and even triple plays are common because of this.[CR]* A base runner cannot begin to steal bases until the pitcher has released the ball. In most baseball video games and in real life, a runner can begin to steal the next base at any time. However, stealing a base beforehand can only be done if you continuously press the steal button right after the screen cuts-back after the batter hit a foul ball, and the pitcher will not even notice you running.[CR]* The 3rd baseman, 2nd baseman, and 1st baseman will not leave the base to retrieve a ball. They will instead stand on the base and wait for another fielder to get the ball, which can sometimes mean they will stand there while the ball rolls inches away from them. The only exception would be if the shortstop covers third or second base for the fielder; then they remain in the stationary position.[CR]* Since the game has semi-automatic fielding, you cannot change which defensive player you want to run after the ball, which means sometimes the pitcher will end up chasing a ball well into the outfield.[CR]* If a ball is hit far enough into the stands, it can sometimes become stuck, allowing the batter to garnish an in the park home run. Because of the reduced home run zone, faster players can often round the bases by hitting the ball up into the fair-zone stands.[CR]* The computer players will always attempt to hit the ball straight, as if trying to hit a home run, no matter what the strength of the batter. This can sometimes give an unfair advantage to you, since they do not try to pull the ball just barely fair in order to get a hit. This has its downfall, in that some powerful players will hit home runs easily.[CR]* You cannot play against a team from the other league.[CR]* If you manage to score more than 100 runs, your score will turn back to zero, as there are only two spaces for your runs. Consequently, if you score 101 runs, and your opponent scores two runs, you will lose the game 01-02.[CR]* You cannot change players positions in the field or line up without replacing them.[CR]* If another player is in your line of path to throw the ball, they will catch the ball after you throw it. This means that if the shortstop retrieves a ground ball just behind 3rd base, then the throw will get cut-off by the 3rd baseman and then the pitcher before the ball gets to 1st base. The pitcher will almost always get in the way, and this can present a problem when trying to pull a double play between third and first or second and home.[CR][B]Staff[/B][CR]Developed by Pallas.[CR][B]Game Ports[/B][CR]* Consoles :[CR][JP] SNK Neo-Geo (1991) "2020 Super Baseball [Model NGH-030]"[CR][JP] Nintendo Super Famicom (1993) "2020 Toshi no Super Baseball [Model SHVC-SA]"[CR][JP] Sega Mega Drive (1994) "2020 Toshi Super Baseball [Model EM20027]"[CR][JP] SNK Neo-Geo CD (1995) "2020 Super Baseball [Model NGCD-030]"[CR]</plot>

		<plot>720&#176; (c) 1986 Atari Games. [CR]720&#176; is a one or two-player arcade game with players taking on the role of a skateboarder, and must perform various tricks and maneuvers to earn the points and tickets needed to compete for medals in the game's numerous skate parks. [CR]The bulk of the action takes place in a 'Skate City', a small urban area made up of ramps, jumps and hazards. Players can skate anywhere they wish as they perform the tricks and jumps needed to reach the score thresholds that will earn them entry tickets to Skate City's skate parks to compete for medals and cash prizes. [CR]Each score threshold must be reached and a park entered within a tight time limit. Failure to do so sees the skater persued by a swarm of bees and the words SKATE OR DIE appear. Should the bees touch the skater before he enters a park, the game ends. Skate City's roads and pavements are populated with moving traffic and pedestrians and any collision with them will result in the skater being knocked from his board, costing the player precious seconds. [CR]The parks themselves each feature one of four different disciplines: Slalom, Jump, Downhill and Ramp. Each park has a timer and players can earn either a bronze, silver or gold medal - together with a cash prize - depending on how quickly the park is completed. If the park target score or finish line is not reached before the timer expires, no medal or money is awarded. [CR]Money won can be used to buy equipment upgrades from the stalls that litter Skate City. Players can buy upgraded boards, helmets, pads and shoes. Boards give faster speed; helmets allow for more risky maneuvers; pads give a faster recovery from falls and shoes provide more height on jumps, as well as giving a quicker standing start. [CR]At the start of each new game, players can select from one of two play modes. 'Training Level' is available for beginners and gives players numerous playing hints and tips. 'Experienced Level' is more challenging as well as offering fewer hints. It does, however, include the 'add-a-coin' feature, which allows for awards and items already won to be carried over to a new game. [CR]The main objective is to compete in as many skate parks as possible. There are numerous city hazards to be avoided, such as BMX riders, cars, Frisbee throwers and other skaters. To guide the player around Skate City are map tiles. Riding over one of these will temporaily pause the action and display the layout of the city, including the locations of the skate parks and equipment stalls. [CR]720&#176; features ten 'class levels' which determine the degree of difficulty in the skate parks and the timer in the city streets. Each of the four skate parks is graded in difficulty, ranging from 1 (easiest) to 4 (hardest). [CR]By using the add-a-coin option available in the 'Advanced' game mode, players can keep any special skate equipment they have acquired in the previous game, as well as all accumulated cash, tickets, points and medals.[CR]From Atari Games[CR]THE ULTIMATE AERIAL EXPERIENCE![CR]* Superior graphics and animation for more player involvement.[CR]* Realistic skateboard action lets players attempt daring maneuvers.[CR]* Players select where they want to skate, making each game a different experience.[CR]* New rotary controller allows full directional and circular motions.[CR]* Contemporary cabinet design with new 25" higher-resolution monitor.[CR]* 8" audio speakers to highlight the custom music scores, sound effects, and speech.[CR]* Add-a-Coin feature keeps players in the action.[CR]720&#176; has all the thrills and skills of real skateboarding with both freestyle and competitive action. A totally unique game format challenges players to become champion of the skating world.[CR]* Start by skating to a skatepark to select difficulty.[CR]* Perform skate maneuvers in the city to earn tickets to get into a skatepark.[CR]* The "Ramp" is one of over 20 skateparks.[CR]By definition, a 720&#176; is one of the most daring moves attempted only by the best, where the skater does a full 720-degree twist while soaring through the air. In 720&#176;, the game, players can attempt to perform this move without bodily injury. This is only part of the fantasy world of 720&#176;...[CR]* Unique Action and Game Format.[CR]The player portrays the skater who must earn the right to compete in the skateparks of the city and ultimately win the title of champion of the skating world. The action starts with the player in the middel of "Skate City", where all surfaces are skateable - a skateboarder's dream world! The player earns tickets by performing skillful skate maneuvers in the city.[CR]These tickets allow him to enter the skateparks where he competes against the clock fot gold, silver or bronze medals. "Cash" prizes are awarded to the skater if he qualifies for a medal. After the skatepark competition, the game continues back in the city for more freestyle action. Numerous hazards and obstacles create a busy scenario in the city, and the skater has a limited time to get to another skatepark.[CR]Players can use their "cash" winnings to buy skating equipment from various skate shops though-out the city. [CR]- BOARDS will give the player faster speed. [CR]- HELMETs allow more risk-taking for successful maneuvers. [CR]- PADS give faster recovery from falls. [CR]- SHOES provide better height on jumps and quicker starts.[CR]* New Controls[CR]Players controls consist of a rotary controller which allows full circular and directional movement. A kick button keeps the player skating, and a jump button is used to "catch air" for higher points. Anything goes in this game, as players learn to make incredible skate maneuvers.[CR]* More Visual and Audio Entertainment.[CR]720&#176; has a new 25" higher-resolution monitor for better graphics and animation than ever before. Plus, 8" speakers highlight the custom music,  sound effects and speech, making the player feel like he's tight there in the action. [CR]* Operator Features[CR]720&#176; is equipped with the comprehensive self-test and statistics package on all recent Atari Games products. Operator difficulty adjustments are also provided by four different option switches.[CR]* Special Game Features[CR]- In 720&#176; players create their own game action as they select where they want to skate. PLayers will find map areas in the city which will momentarily display the layout of the city and the skatepark locations.[CR]- Players can select the class level in which they want to compete. At the start of each game, players skate towards one of four skateparks which very in difficulty from "novice" to "pro". As the game progresses players automatically advance to the next level.[CR]- Players can compete on over 20 skateparks, each requires a different skill. There are variations of a half-pipe ramp, a downhill, a slalom and a jump park.[CR]- The city is filled with hazards which the player must avoid, including: street traffic, BMX bikers, skater gangs, and frisbee throwers/[CR]- An Add-a-Coin feature lets players stay in the action and keep any special skate equipment acquired.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Game ID: 136047[CR]Runs on the "Atari System 2" hardware.[CR]Players: 2[CR]Control: Circular rotating joystick[CR]Buttons: 2[CR]=&gt; [1] Kick, [2] Jump[CR]The cabinet for this game was unique at this time. The speakers for the game are mounted atop the cabinet in a structure resembling a boom box, in line with the game's skate-kid theme. The display is larger than that for a typical arcade game and of a very high resolution (similar to that used for "Paperboy"). The main control is also unique. This joystick moves in a circular fashion, instead of in compass directions like standard joysticks.[CR]* Dimensions[CR]Height: 74.0 in, 188 cm.[CR]Width: 27.5 in, 70 cm.[CR]Depth: 38.0 in, 97 cm.[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]720&#176; was released in December 1986.[CR]2,265 units were produced in the USA. The selling price was $2,995.[CR]720&#176; is notable in that it is one of the first extreme sports video games. The game's name comes from the 'ultimate' skateboarding trick; turning a full 720&#176; (2 complete circles) in the air after jumping off a ramp.[CR]Ron Perelman holds the record for this game with 527,100 points on June 17, 1987.[CR]Soundtrack album releases :[CR]That's Atari Music Vol. 2 ~ G.S.M. Atari Games 2 (PCCB-00070) (September 21, 1991) [Pony Canyon/Scitron][CR]That's Atari Music Vol. 2 ~ G.S.M. Atari Games 2 [Reprint] (SCDC-00314) (December 3, 2003) [Scitron Discs][CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Develop skill in using the rotary control in conjunction with the Jump button to do aerial moves, because they are worth more points. Press the Jump button after gaining speed, and then rotate the control in a 360-degree motion. In this game, it is possible to do much more than just a 360-degree turn![CR]* When attempting certain aerial or rotational moves, it is important to be properly aligned on landing, otherwise the skater bails, or falls down.[CR]* To qualify for medals in the higher classes of skate parks, it is best to try to buy some skate equipment first to allow players to perform harder moves.[CR]* Daring players should try to wait out the timer in the streets, performing skate moves and acquiring points until the timer is about to expire.[CR]* In the ramp park, a good trick is to constantly push the kick button and do skid-outs at the top of each side of the half-pipe. To do this, get to the lip of the ramp, hold the stick parallel with the lip, and stop pressing kick. This will cause you to grind and skid down the ramp. You will be awarded big points at the lip and at the base of the ramp. This procedure may be repeated over and over for some incredible (effortless) high scores.[CR]* Don't forget to visit the skate shops. Do not underestimate what a new board and shoes do for you. Buying new equipment allows you to move faster, jump farther, recover faster, and pull off more tricks.[CR]* In the ramp section, levels 8, 9, and 10 : holding down the kick and jump buttons simultaneously on the lip of the ramp will boost your air. This trick only works when you're going the correct speed (usually your third or fourth jump), and only once (as far as I can tell) per ramp session per level.[CR]* The entire game should focus around the Sessions skate park (the blue park in the right quadrant of the play-field). Making multiple passes through this park will greatly increase your scores. Remember to keep jumping and spinning. A good game should leave you feeling completely exhausted![CR][B]Staff[/B][CR]Software / Game design : John Salwitz[CR]Playfield / Game design : Dave Ralston[CR]Software : Paul Kwinn[CR]Technical assistance : Rob Rowe[CR]Animation : Sam Comstock, Will Noble, Mark West[CR]Audio : Brad Fuller[CR]Music : Hal Canon, Earl Vickers[CR]Control design : Jack Aknin[CR]Game design : Milt Loper[CR]Hardware support : Gary Stempler[CR]With invaluable support from : Dave Cook, Dennis harper, Russel Dawe (Rusty), Jess Melchor[CR][B]Game Ports[/B][CR]* Consoles : [CR]Nintendo NES [US] (November 1989) "720&#176; [Model NES-72-USA]"[CR]Sony PlayStation [US] (September 30, 1999) "Arcade Party Pak [Model SLUS-00952]"[CR]Sony PlayStation [EU] (February 23, 2001) "Arcade Party Pak [Model SLES-02339]" [CR]Sega Dreamcast [US] (November 15, 2001) "Midway's Greatest Arcade Hits Vol. 2 [Model T-9714N]" [CR]Sony PlayStation 2 [US] (November 18, 2003) "Midway Arcade Treasures [Model SLUS-20801]" [CR]Microsoft XBOX [US] (November 24, 2003) "Midway Arcade Treasures" [CR]Nintendo GameCube [US] (December 18, 2003) "Midway Arcade Treasures [Model DOL-GAKE-USA]" [CR]Microsoft XBOX [EU] (February 6, 2004) "Midway Arcade Treasures" [CR]Sony PlayStation 2 [EU] (February 6, 2004) "Midway Arcade Treasures [Model SLES-51927]" [CR]Microsoft XBOX 360 [US] (November 6, 2012) "Midway Arcade Origins" [CR]Sony PlayStation 3 [US] (November 6, 2012) "Midway Arcade Origins [Model BLUS-31083]"[CR]Microsoft XBOX 360 [EU] (November 15, 2012) "Midway Arcade Origins" [CR]Sony PlayStation 3 [EU] (November 15, 2012) "Midway Arcade Origins [Model BLES-01768]"[CR]* Handhelds : [CR]Atari Lynx [Unreleased Prototype] [CR]Nintendo Game Boy Color [US] (1999) "720&#176; [Model DMG-AA7E-USA]" [CR]Nintendo Game Boy Color [EU] (1999) "720&#176; [Model DMG-AA7P-EUR]"[CR]Sony PSP [US] (December 13, 2005) "Midway Arcade Treasures Extended Play [Model ULUS-10059]"[CR]Sony PSP [EU] (February 24, 2006) "Midway Arcade Treasures Extended Play [Model ULES-00180]" [CR]* Computers : [CR]Commodore C64 [EU] (1987) : Featuring a recording of the arcade soundtrack on the flip-side of the cassette.

The text refers to a '140mph' slapshot -- The individual who wrote this seems to have forgotten to do the metric conversion from kilometers per hour. He/she should have written 140 km/h (or 90 mph) as that's more realistic.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Hidden Characters (Initials, Birth-date) :[CR]Al Lasko - AL(space), Aug 31[CR]Andy Lycke - AL(space), Nov 23[CR]Art Tianis - AJT, Oct 23[CR]Bill Dabelstein - DOZ, Dec 31[CR]Brian Eddie - BRE, Apr 20[CR]Bridgitte Fedesna - BMF, May 09[CR]Carlos Pesina - CCP, Nov 15[CR]Cary Mednick - CMM, Jul 02[CR]Chris Bobrowski - ME(space), May 12[CR]Christa Woss - CLW, Jul 09[CR]Craig Janney - C(space)J, Sept 26[CR]Dan Thompson - DJT, Jun 04[CR]Dave Michicich - DLM, Aug 06[CR]Dave Zab - ZAB, May 28[CR]Ed Boon - EJB, Feb 22[CR]Ed Keenan - EJK, Apr 10[CR]Eddie Ferrier - EF(space), Jun 10[CR]Eugeene Geer - OEG, Nov 05[CR]Eugene Jarvis - EPJ, Jan 27[CR]Evil Haeger - JH(space), Jul 13[CR]Glenn Shipp - GWS, Jun 11[CR]Gordie Howe - G(space)H, Mar 31[CR]Heather Beach - HAB, Mar 24[CR]Jack H.

		<plot>U.S.Championship Beach Volley - V'Ball (c) 1988 Technos Japan Corp.[CR]The player takes control of a pair of beach bums named George and Michael who make their living playing beach volleyball against locals. One day, they find a flyer for a nationwide beach volleyball tournament offering the winning team a $2,500,000 cash prize.[CR]In single-player mode, one person controls both characters on a team. In two-player mode, the players either cooperate by playing on the same team or compete against each other by controlling opposing teams. The American version allows the game to be played by up to four players (if the cabinet allows it). The single-player mode consists of two cycles with four stages: the Minor Circuit and the Major Circuit. The stages in the game are Daytona Beach, New York, Los Angeles and Hawaii. After completing the Major Circuit, the player faces against the U.S. Navy team, set in a naval base.[CR]The controls consist of an eight directional joystick and two buttons for jumping and receiving. The characters perform several moves including power spiking, back spiking, jump-serving, blocking and diving.[CR]There are a few minor differences between the Japanese and American releases. The Japanese release features an opening cut-scene explaining the plot. Between matches, intermission sequences depict the main characters visiting a car dealership to purchase a vehicle. As the player progresses, the cars increase in quality, shifting from used cars to new cars during the Major Circuit. The American release removes these cut-scenes, but extends the multiplayer support to up to four players with multiple game modes: 1 or 2 players against the computer, 1-on-1, 2-on-1, or 2-on-2.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Game ID : TA-0025[CR]Main CPU : MOS Technology M6502 (@ 2 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 3.579545 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : Yamaha YM2151 (@ 3.579545 Mhz), OKI6295 (@ 8 Khz)[CR]Players : 4[CR]Control : 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 2[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]U.S.Championship Beach Volley was released in December 1988.[CR]V'Ball stands for 'VolleyBall'.[CR][B]Game Ports[/B][CR]* Consoles :[CR]Nintendo Famicom (1989, US : "Super Spike V'Ball", Japan : "US Championship V'Ball")[CR]</plot>

This trick is best done here.[CR]2) Collect negative points to roll your score back under zero. You will be granted massive time on the massive points you have. Unfortunately, time will be taken off at an incredible rate.[CR]3) Run over the negative points flag as necessary to get rid of the points you win just by moving forward and crashing into the nearby trees.[CR]4) Repeat Step 4 until you've run out of time. You now have a completely unbeatable high-score which (if it were 1981) people would beg you to tell them how you did it.[CR]WARNING : ABSOLUTELY, POSITIVELY DON'T GO BACK ACROSS ZERO OR YOUR GAME WILL END IMMEDIATELY!!![CR][B]Game Ports[/B][CR]* Consoles : [CR]Sony PlayStation 2 [JP] (July 28, 2005) "Taito Memories Joukan [Model SLPM-66057]" [CR]Sony PlayStation 2 [AU] (March 30, 2006) "Taito Legends 2 [Model SLES-53852]" [CR]Microsoft XBOX [EU] (March 31, 2006) "Taito Legends 2" [CR]Sony PlayStation 2 [EU] (March 31, 2006) "Taito Legends 2 [Model SLES-53852]" [CR]Sony PlayStation 2 [US] (May 16, 2007) "Taito Legends 2 [Model SLUS-21349]" [CR]* Handhelds : [CR]Sony PSP [AS] (January 3, 2006) "Taito Memories Pocket [Model UCAS-40040]" [CR]Sony PSP [JP] (January 5, 2006) "Taito Memories Pocket [Model ULJM-05076]" [CR]Sony PSP [KO] (February 10, 2006) "Taito Memories Pocket" [CR]Sony PSP [EU] (October 6, 2006) "Taito Legends Power-Up [Model ULES-00473]" [CR]Sony PSP [AU] (November 9, 2006) "Taito Legends Power-Up [Model ULES-00473]" [CR]Sony PSP [US] (May 17, 2007) "Taito Legends Power-Up [Model ULUS-10208]" [CR]* Computers : [CR]PC [MS Windows, CD-ROM] [EU] (March 31, 2006) "Taito Legends 2" [CR]PC [MS Windows, CD-ROM] [US] (July 10, 2007) "Taito Legends 2"[CR]</plot>

If the ball gets closer to the pin than the previous record, you will earn a bonus hole.[CR]2) The longest driving contest : you have to shoot the ball as far as possible in one hit. If you exceed the previous record, you will earn a bonus hole.[CR]* The order from the best to the worst performance is :[CR]Albatros (3 hits less than for a Par)[CR]Eagle (2 hits less than for a Par)[CR]Birdie (1 hit less than for a Par)[CR]Par (the average level)[CR]Bogey (1 hit more than for a Par)[CR]Double Bogey (2 hits more than for a Par)[CR]Triple Bogey (3 hits more than for a Par)[CR]If you miss the attempt to make a Triple Bogey, you will have to give up the hole and will suffer an additional penalty.[CR]If the ball arrives out of bound or in the water, you will be penalized one stroke.[CR]* You CAN apply spin to the ball, forward or back. Neo Turf Masters requires two taps on the keypad to strike the ball. The first tap determines power, the second tap determines loft. After the first tap and before the second, push up or down on the joystick. You can get a wicked backspin on the ball. You can also forward spin through the wind, or land short and roll nicely up a hill.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1. Neo Turf Masters (1996)[CR]2.

		<plot>Q*bert (c) 1982 Gottlieb.[CR]The object of the Q*bert game is to change the color of the top of the cubes to the Destination color indicated at the upper-left corner of the screen (below Player 1's score) by hopping onto them. When all the cubes in the pyramid have been changed to the Destination color, the screen will advance to the next round, with the player-controlled Q*bert character starting back on the top cube. At the beginning of each Level, there will be a short demonstration cycle with Q*bert hopping around four cubes to explain to the player the play action of each Level. Each level consists of four Rounds. The current level number and round number is displayed at the upper-right corner of the screen (below Player 2's score in a 2-player game).[CR]The game play starts with Q*bert appearing at the top of the pyramid. The joystick will move Q*bert from cube to cube by hopping in any of four diagonal directions. Q*bert can move anywhere on the pyramid, but jumping off will kill him. Hopping on the rotating disk will take Q*bert back to the top of the pyramid. In the first two Rounds of play, Q*bert will have to avoid touching the red and purple balls. These deadly objects drop randomly onto the second-from-the-top level and bounce downwards. The red balls will fall off the bottom, but the purple ball will stop at the bottom and hatch into Coily, the snake which chases Q*bert. To destroy Coily, lure him to the edge, then jump unto a disk. The disk will take Q*bert back to the top and Coily will fall off, awarding 500 points and clearing the board of all other 'nasty' characters.[CR]Starting at the 3rd Round of play, other 'nasty' characters come into play. The green characters or objects are safe to hop onto and will award points. All other 'nasty' characters are deadly to touch. In the third Round the red balls will stop falling, but two purple characters named Ugg and Wrong Way will appear at the lower portion of the pyramid and travel sideways and upwards (Ugg is the one with the snout moving from right to left on the right sides of the cubes, and Wrong Way is the one with the big eyes moving from left to right on the left sides of the cubes). They will not chase Q*bert, but will move randomly to get in Q*bert's way. In the third Round and every Round after, based on an internal timer, a green ball will appear and bounce down from the top of the pyramid. Hopping Q*bert onto the green ball will award 100 points, and freeze all the characters on the screen for a few seconds, but 'Q*bert' will still be able to move to complete the color changes.[CR]During the 4th Round of play, two green characters named Slick and Sam will appear, based on the internal timer (Slick is the one wearing shades; Sam does not wear shades, otherwise their function is identical). They will drop onto the second level from the top and hop randomly downwards. If they hop onto a cube that Q*bert has already changed the color of, the cube will change to a different color to thwart Q*Bert. Hopping Q*Bert onto Slick or Sam will stop them and award 300 points.[CR]Throughout the remaining Rounds, all the characters and objects will appear in random combinations with increasing speed.[CR]To add variety to the game, the disks will change positions every Round, and in the higher Levels the number of disks will change.[CR]During Level 2, the play action will increase in difficulty from changing the cubes to one color, to changing the color of the cubes twice. This mean: that each cube would have to be hopped on twice to change the pyramid to the destination color, completing the Round.[CR]Starting at Level 3 and for all remaining Rounds, and Levels, the play action will become more difficult. The object remains to change the cubes to the Destination color, but if Q*Bert hops on any cube, that cube will change color. So even if the cube has already been changed to the Destination color, it will change again.[CR]Here is a rundown of how all the colors change :[CR]Legend :[CR]S - Starting Color[CR]I - Intermediate Color[CR]D - Destination color[CR]LEVEL 1 : When Q*bert jumps on S or I, it changes to D. When he jumps on D, it stays at D (NOTE : During the 4th round, when Slick/Sam jumps on D, it changes to I).[CR]LEVEL 2 : When Q*bert jumps on S, it changes to I. When he jumps on I, it changes to D. When he jumps on D, it stays at D.[CR]LEVEL 3 : When Q*bert jumps on S, it changes to D. When he jumps on D, it changes back to S. Q*bert must start again.[CR]LEVEL 4 : When Q*bert jumps on S, it changes to I. When he jumps on I, it changes to D. When he jumps on D, it changes back to I. Q*bert must start again.[CR]LEVEL 5 : When Q*bert jumps on S, it changes to I. When he jumps on I, it changes to D. When he jumps on D, it changes back to S. Q*bert must start again.[CR]LEVELS 6-9 : Same color pattern as Level 5. The difference is the increased speed of Q*bert and the 'nasty' characters.[CR]There are also bonus points awarded at the end of each round for successfully completing the round. The bonus for the completion of the 1st round is 1000 points. This Bonus will progressively increase each Round by 250 points to a maximum of 5000 points at Level 5.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Game ID : GV-103[CR]Main CPU : I8086 (@ 5 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU : MOS Technology M6502 (@ 894.886 Khz)[CR]Sound Chips : DAC, Votrax SC-01[CR]Players: 2[CR]Control : 4-way joystick (diagonal)[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Q*bert was released in October 1982.[CR]Licensed to Konami for Japanese distribution (February 1983).[CR]Inspired by artwork by M.C. Escher who was an artist that Jeff admired. Ron Waxman came up with the idea of Q*bert changing the color of the cubes. Q*bert's name originated by the combination of 'Cube' and 'Hubert', but the 'Cube-Bert' was changed to 'Q-bert' to make it more unique. The concept game was called 'Snots and Boogers' and then '@!#?@!' (which many of the programmers and Gottlieb VPs said would be impossible to get anyone to say) before the final version was called just 'Q*bert'. Slick and Sam were a play on the phrase 'spick and span' with Sam being named after co-worker Sam Russo. Rick Tighe came up with the idea of adding the pinball hardware which generated the very mechanical KA-CHUNK when Q*bert falls off the pyramid.[CR]A Votrax SC-01 speech synthesis chip is used to generate the incoherent speech of Q*bert swearing, Slick and Sam (high pitch) and Wrong-way and Ugg (low pitch). The only true speech ever generated is Q*bert saying 'Hello, I'm turned on' when the game is first powered up and 'Bye Bye' after entering your initials at the end of a game.[CR]Approximately 30000 units were produced by Gottlieb.[CR]Several early cabinets were produced with '@!#?@!' on the marquee.[CR]Bob Gerhardt holds the official records for this game in 'Marathon' setting with 33273520 points on November 28, 1983.[CR]Tom Gault holds the official records for this game in 'Tournament' setting with 1,895,565 points.[CR]A slightly different version known as 'Mello Yello' was programmed for promotion of the Mellow-Yellow softdrink, but it was never released to the market.[CR]As well as being a huge commercial success as a game, Q*bert also provided revenue from its many tie-in products. Toys, games, and other products bearing the hero&#8217;s likeness all sold well. There was even a Q*bert cartoon; Saturday Supercade was a CBS cartoon series which featured a number of different segments starring various video game characters. In addition to the characters from the game, the Q*Bert segment featured Q*tee (Q*bert's girlfriend), Q*bit (his little brother), and others.[CR]Such was the character's popularity at this time that Gottlieb assigned pinball designer, John Trudeau ("Creature From the Black Lagoon", "Congo"), to devise a Q*bert pinball. It was called "Q*bert's Quest" and Trudeau created an innovative design pattern that should have sparked arcade goers to try it. Remarkably, the table was a commercial flop. Released in March 1983, a paltry 884 machines dribbled out of the plant and further convinced management that pinball was indeed experiencing desperate times.[CR]A Q*bert unit appears in the 1983 movie 'Koyaanisqatsi - Life out of Balance'.[CR]Parker Brothers released a boardgame based on this videogame (same name) in 1983 : Object of the game is to be one of the 'NOSER ELITE' by removing more pegs from the pyramid than your opponent (Peg plugged into cube = Starting color; Peg removed from cube = Destination color).[CR]One player takes on the role of the hero, Q*bert, who must make his way around the pyramid trying to remove as many pegs as he can. A second player controls the 'nasty' characters out to thwart Q*bert.[CR]The main characters make an appearance on the 2012 animation movie "Wreck-It Ralph" from Walt Disney Animation Studios.[CR][B]Scoring[/B][CR]Changing a cube to the Intermediate color : 15 points.[CR]Changing a cube to the Destination color : 25 points.[CR]Catching the Green Ball : 100 points[CR]Catching Slick/Sam : 300 points.[CR]Luring Coily off pyramid : 500 points bonus.[CR]Completing a round : 750 points + 250 points x round number.[CR]End of round bonus : 50 points per teleport disc remaining.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Control Panel Instructions :[CR]Goal : Change the tops of all cubes to a new color by hopping onto them.[CR]Joystick moves 'Q*bert' from cube to cube.

All other objects are deadly.[CR]Destroy the snake by leading him to the edge, then jumping on a disk.[CR]Stay on pyramid! Only jump off to use a disk.[CR]* A big part of the game is waiting to see where 'nasty' characters are going to jump. You need to make sure you always time a jump at the same time the 'nasty' characters jump, so you can always have a clear path to a new square.[CR]* Since the game only has nine levels, if you can master Level 9 then you should be able to play indefinitely since Level 9 repeats once you reach it and the game doesn't get any harder.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

		<plot>Bubble Bobble (c) 1986 Taito Corp.[CR]One or two players take on the role of Bub and Bob, two cute dinosaurs who must battle through 100 platform-packed single screen levels to rescue their girlfriends. Bub and Bob are armed only with the ability to blow bubbles, in which the game's many enemies can be trapped and killed. The bubbles can also be used as temporary platforms, to help the dinosaurs reach previously inaccessible areas of a level. [CR]Any trapped enemies who are not killed quickly enough will turn red and escape their bubble prison. These angry enemies are much faster than before, making them harder to kill. Enemies also become angry if players are taking too long to complete a level. Defeated enemies are turned into bonus fruit items that can be collected for points. [CR]On many levels, bubbles containing fire, water or a lightning bolt appear. These can be burst by players to release their contents and destroy enemies. The fire bubble drops flames down onto the nearest platform, killing any enemies it hits. The lightning bubble sends a lightning bolt horizontally across the screen, its direction dictated by whichever side of the bubble the player hits to burst it. The water bubble releases a torrent of water that will quickly flow down the platforms to the bottom of the screen. Any enemies caught in the flow are killed. [CR]Bubbles containing letters also appear. The aim is to collect the letters needed to speel the word E.X.T.E.N.D. which earns players an extra life. [CR]The game's simple-yet-involving game-play saw Bubble Bobble become an instant classic. Its two-player co-operative mode, coupled with the incredible amount of hidden secrets and potential for strategic play - unheard of in the platform genre - would set the standard by which all other platform games were judged.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Main CPU : (2x) Zilog Z80 (@ 6 Mhz), Zilog Z80 (@ 3 Mhz), M6801 (@ 1 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : YM2203 (@ 3 Mhz), YM3526 (@ 3 Mhz)[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 2-Way Joystick[CR]Buttons : 2[CR]=&gt; [1] Bubble, [2] Jump[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Bubble Bobble was released in August 1986. [CR]This was one of the first games to feature multiple endings. [CR]The title of this game, Bubble Bobble, is a cross between the words 'bubble' and the name of the heroes : Bub and Bob. [CR]The enemies are named (Round number of initial appearance applies to 'Normal' mode. For information on 'Super' mode, please see the Romstar (US version) entry, Updates section : [CR]'Zen-Chan' [aka 'Bubble Buster', 'Benzo'] - First appears in Round 1 [CR]'Mighta' [aka 'Stoner', 'Boris'] - First appears in Round 6 [CR]'Monsta' [aka 'Beluga', 'Blubba'] - First appears in Round 10 [CR]'PulPul' [aka 'Hullaballoon', 'Boaboa'] - First appears in Round 20 [CR]'Banebou' [aka 'Coiley', 'Bonnie-bo'] - First appears in Round 30 [CR]'Hidegonsu' [aka 'Incendo'] - First appears in round 40 [CR]'Drunk' [aka 'Willy Whistle', 'Bonner'] - First appears in Round 50 [CR]'Invader' [aka 'Super Socket'] - First appears in Round 60 [CR]'Super Drunk' [aka 'Grumple Gromit'] - the boss character whom Bub and Bob fight in the final round [CR]'Skel-Monsta' [aka 'Baron Von Blubba'] - Appears when you take too much time in a round [CR]'Rascal' [aka 'Rubblen'] - Appears when you linger too long in a secret room [CR]The data code contains unused graphics of a full set of slot machine icons. These aren't used anywhere, there's no palette that fits them, and they wouldn't really fit anywhere either. [CR]In 1996, Taito announced that they lost the original source code program to Bubble Bobble following a reorganization - when it came to the recent ports and sequels, they had to work from program disassembly, playing the game and (mainly) the various home computer ports. [CR]The game forbids the initials 'SEX' on the high score table. If you try, it gets changed to 'H.!', but go to the Tips and Tricks section for more information about 'SEX' :-) [CR]Olly Cotton holds the official record for this game with 6,060,730 points on February 23, 2011. [CR]Some bootlegs of this game are known as "Bobble Bobble" and "Super Bobble Bobble". [CR]Alfa Records released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Taito Game Music - 28XA-110) on January 25, 1987. [CR]NES cover band The Advantage cover two songs from Bubble Bobble on their self-titled debut album released on April 6, 2004.[CR][B]Scoring[/B][CR]Bursting a bubble : 10 points. [CR]Killing one monster : 1,000 points. [CR]Killing two monsters at once : 2,000 points. [CR]Killing three monsters at once : 4,000 points. [CR]Points double for each extra monster killed at any one time. [CR]Normal Fruit : 700 points. [CR]Bonus Score Items (popcorn, burger etc) : 500 - 4,000 points.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Bubble Bobble is a game heavily relying on game-play and precise technique rather than graphics, and it features a series of special techniques and tricks a player can perform to maximize his or her score, make some rounds of the game easier or faster to finish or just to be able to survive or even finish a round. Some of these techniques have special nicknames, which may differ from player to player and from country to country. [CR]'Kissing monsters' or just kissing means killing a monster by blowing a bubble at almost contact distance : the monster will be instantly bubbled and the bubble will be instantly popped, giving the visual effect of the player killing a monster with a 'kiss'. Some players flip their joysticks in the opposite direction after pressing the bubble buttons, giving more chances of an 'instant pop' and changing flight direction for the dead monster. This technique is useful in stages where monsters move too fast, bubbles last for too short of a time or it's otherwise hard to bubble them normally. Of course good timing is required for this technique to work. [CR]'Riding bubbles' means keeping the jump button pressed when dropping on a bubble: if done correctly, instead of popping the bubble, your dragon will instead jump on it, possibly continuously, enabling him to 'ride' bubbles in order to reach otherwise unreachable areas. Some stages can't be finished without this technique. [CR]'Climbing' is a step up from riding bubbles. It means standing at half a bubble distance from a wall, jumping and blowing a bubble almost simultaneously, jumping up from that bubble and blowing another bubble and so on. This is necessary if the air current pushes down bubbles but you need to climb up. Having the rapid-bubbling power-up (the yellow candy) makes climbing a lot easier, especially if you got the running shoes already. [CR]'Bubbling oneself through' means 'riding a bubble' through the opening at the top of a stage or even just through the ceiling of a stage in order to appear at the lower part, like some flying monsters can do. This technique is required to finish some stages or to get unstuck from some places, or just to save time. [CR]'Blowing against the wall' means blowing bubbles against wall at contact distance : the bubbles will pop immediately thus giving the player 10 points per bubble pop. This can be used to either increase a player's score, or to set a player's score to a specific amount, in order to do other tricks. [CR]'Two equal digits' means using the 'blowing against the wall' technique or other score-adjusting techniques in order to make the two penultimate (100s and 10s places) digits of at least one player equal, e.g., 456770, before the last enemy bubble is burst. If done correctly and the score is not modified when this occurs, then all remaining non-special bubbles on screen will be turned to 700-point bonuses, whose appearance depends on the digit picked. E.g., 7 gives Chocolate Ice Creams, 3 gives Hamburgers, and so on. [CR]Note : This trick is easier to do with two players (one player adjusts his score and the other bursts the bubbles), but it can also be done with only one player, although calculating exactly how much (and if) one's score will be modified when bursting the last enemy bubbles can be extremely complex, if not unpredictable, especially if there are very large and clustered bubble bunches. [CR]Note : Rounds with numbers ending with 5 and 0 up to and including level 50 generate bonuses from bubbles automatically, though, and some rounds (including round 1) do it by default. [CR]Internal Counters : An interesting (and exploitable) part of bubble bobble is that powerups are not entirely random. As with the two-digit trick, many internal counters in this game decide which special powers are available for collection. For example, rapid bubble shooting (a sweet in yellow wrapping), fast moving bubbles (a blue sweet), or fast moving bubbles (a blue sweet) appear shortly after either Bub or Bob jumps 51 times, pops 51 bubbles, or blows 51 bubbles. Also, running around a lot causes the speed powerup (red shoe) to appear. Keeping this is mind, it is possible to gain all power-ups with relative ease. Although there are many more counters that control various aspects of the game, one of particular interest is the letters forming the word EXTEND. Getting all 7 letters will end the current level and award the player with an extra life 'NICE 1P!' - these letters have a greater chance of appearing when more enemies are defeated simultaneously. Also, gathering three of the same letter causes candy canes to appear which in turn lead to a special big item at the end of the level! [CR]* Unlimited Run And Rapid Fire : At the main title screen, press Left, Jump, Left, 1P, Left, Fire, Left, 1P. If this is done correctly there will be a message in the bottom left corner of the title screen a red POWER UP!. [CR]* Original Bubble Bobble : At the title screen, press Shoot, Jump, Shoot, Jump, Shoot, Jump, Right, 1P. It will say at the bottom of screen ORIGINAL GAME. The game will give the PORTALS in some screens, if you can get in them you will get LOADS of diamonds. [CR]* The 'Super Bubble Bobble' Code : this will change the Bubble Bobble logo in 'Super Bubble Bobble' and the game will change under several points of view : different platform colors, different order for monster appearances... The code that must be entered at the title screen to access Super Bubble Bobble is displayed at the end of the credits after you beat the game in 2 players, normal mode. The message is coded, but it hints you to enter the secret room in level 20 to get the key for decoding. If you do so, you enter the secret room, on the base of which there is an inscription. The first line is the coding of the alphabet, the other lines are coded advices to beat the final boss. The decoded 'secret message' is : SJBLRJSR (Start - Jump - Bubble - Left - Right - Jump - Start - Right) [CR]The decoded advices in the secret rooms are : [CR]Room in level 20 : IF YOU WANT TO BECOME THE OLD FIGURE, USE THE POWER OF YOUR FRIENDSHIP, AND FIGHT WITH ME! (hint to play in two player mode to defeat the final boss and see the real ending) [CR]Room in level 30 : I ENCLOSE THESE MAGICAL MEDICINE HERE, BECAUSE THOSE ARE MY WORST FEARS... (hint to use the lighting bubble to beat the boss) [CR]Room in level 40 : IF YOU WANT TO GET BACK YOUR LOVE OF TRUTH, YOU MUST HELP EACH OTHER UNTILL THE LAST... (hint to end the game in two player mode to see the real endings) [CR]A little more trivia on Super Bubble Bobble : If you beat the game in Super mode, two players, you will discover that the final boss is your mother and father that were controlled by some unknown evil. By defeating the boss you free them and your girlfriends, and are reverted back to your original human form (the one you play "Rainbow Island" with). [CR]* Secret Tombs : Make it to level 20 without dying and a door appears -- it leads to a 'secret tomb', a level full of diamonds. There are secret tombs at levels 20 and 30, also. Make it to level 50 without dying and a strange, bee-hive-shaped door appears; enter it and you warp to level 70. DON'T kill the Drunks on level 50, or the door disappears; bubble them and wait! Btw, with two players, only one of the players must survive unharmed to get the secret door. [CR]* Paffing A Skel : Skel, also known as 'Baron Von Blubba', is that nasty white monster that comes after you when you've taken too long; with two players, two Skels will appear. If one player is killed by HIS Skel, then he can collide with his partner's Skel 'WHILE HE IS STILL FLICKERING'. If the player's icon is still flickering, the other player's Skel will disappear (poof!), with no harm to the once-slain character. [CR]* Full Ending Sequence : Beat the game with two players in Super mode and you'll get the full end sequence. [CR]* High Score Codes : after getting a high score, enter your initials as : [CR]'SEX' - Pitch fork-flying cakes/vegetables/etc across the screen, turn enemies into 6k diamonds. [CR]'TAK' - Octopus-turns bubbles into X's at end of level. [CR]'STR' - Flamingo-turns bubbles into smiling turds at end of level. [CR]'KTT' - Beer-turns bubbles into pizzas at end of level, what a perfect match !!! [CR]'...' - Knife-flying cakes/vegetables/etc across the screen, turn enemies into 6k diamonds. [CR]'I.F', 'MTJ', 'NSO', 'KIM', 'YSH' - Coke can-flying sunflowers across the screen, turn enemies into 6k diamonds.

		<plot>Snow Bros. - Nick &amp; Tom (c) 1990 Toaplan.[CR]One or two players take on the roles of snowmen Nick and Tom as they battle a variety of monsters over fifty platform-based, single screen levels. The snowmen must throw snowballs at the enemies, eventually encasing them completely in snow. The encased enemies must them be kicked in order to destroy them. This is achieved by standing next to the snowball and pressing the "kick out" button, which sends the giant snowball flying around the screen, killing any enemies that lay in its path. During every 10th level, the players must face and defeat an end-of-level boss.[CR]A number of power-ups are available, in the form of coloured potions. The power-ups are as follows :[CR]* Yellow = Long shot[CR]* Red = Speed up[CR]* Blue = Bigger snowballs (encases monsters quicker)[CR]* Green = Inflates the players like a balloon and lets them fly around the screen, killing any monsters they touch.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Game ID : MIN16-02[CR]Main CPU : Motorola 68000 (@ 8 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 6 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : YM3812 (@ 3 Mhz)[CR]Screen orientation : Horizontal[CR]Video resolution : 256 x 224 pixels[CR]Screen refresh : 57.50 Hz[CR]Palette colors : 256[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 2[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Snow Bros. was released in April 1990. [CR]Like Taito's "Liquid Kids", Snow Bros. was licensed to Manchester's Ocean Software for conversion to both the Atari ST and the Commodore Amiga home computers but, again like "Liquid Kids", Ocean decided that the game wouldn't perform well at retail and the game was cancelled. It has since been released, in its entirety, to the emulation community and is a fine conversion.[CR]This game was released as a conversion kit only (often factory installed in a generic cabinet), so any such machine could be converted into a proper Snow Bros. machine. This title is JAMMA compatible (the circuit board for it is one of the smallest ever made, it is barely larger than a Nintendo Famicom cartridge). The marquee for this title shows a 'Snow Bros.' logo, with two snowmen, and a couple of cartoon enemies in the background - in keeping with the game's 'cute' theme.[CR]Licensed to Romstar for USA distribution.[CR]A bootleg of this game is known as "The Winter Bobble".[CR]Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Out Zone, Snow Bros. - PCCB-00044) on 21/10/1990.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Killing all the monsters on a level with a single snowball causes money bonuses, worth 10,000 points, to fall down, but sometimes a glowing cake bonus will appear instead. When the cake is collected, the game stops and four blue snowball creatures appear for a short time. If these enemies are killed, they each provide a letter : S,N,O or W. Collect all four of these letters for an extra life. The glowing cake can also appear at other times during the game.[CR]* Hidden Functions : If the 'Invulnerability dip switch' is enabled, you are invulnerable but you may also 'Pause' the game with P2 Start and restart with P1 Start.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

		<plot>Columns (c) 1990 Sega Enterprises, Limited. [CR]Sega's answer to the legendary "Tetris", the rules of Columns are simple : a column of 3 square pieces - stacked one on top of the other - drops from the top of the screen into the play area. As with Tetris, the column puzzle pieces can be moved left and right as they fall, but unlike Tetris, they cannot be rotated. Instead, pressing a button will cause the order of the colored blocks in a column to shift by one position.[CR]The object of the game is to place columns at the bottom of the pit in such a way that lines of 3 or more like-colored blocks are created (either horizontally, vertically or diagonally). When this happens, these blocks disappear, and any blocks resting upon them immediately fall onto the recently vacated space. This will often cause additional lines to be arranged, producing a 'cascade' effect. The key to a long game (and, ultimately, a high score) is to set up these cascades wherever possible.[CR]While not achieving the same legendary status as the mighty "Tetris" (something that no puzzle game can realistically hope to achieve), the 'Columns' series has managed to garner a dedicated following of its own and is a respected example of the genre.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs Sega "System C-2" hardware.[CR]Players: 2[CR]Control: 4-Way Joystick[CR]Buttons: 1 (Rotate)[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Columns was released in March 1990.[CR]April Simmonds of Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada holds the official record for this game with 267,360 points on November 13, 2006.[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]The US version is slightly different :[CR]* 'Winners Don't Use Drugs' screen added.[CR]* Sega logo screen during the attract mode added.[CR]* Cocktail mode dip-switch.[CR]* Different music.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

		<plot>Klax (c) 1989 Atari Games.[CR]The tiles klank end over end down the ramp. Catch them on the paddle, or they fall in the pit. Flip them from the paddle into the bins, matching the same-colored tiles horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Each line of colored tiles is a Klax. When you've made a Klax, you hear a fanfare. When you complete a wave, the crowd cheers. Let a tile fall in the pit, and you hear a scream as it falls in. If you fail to complete a wave, the crowd is disappointed. Stay alive, complete the waves and don't drop any tiles![CR]Catch the tiles as they come to the end of the ramp on the paddle. Flip a tile into a bin by pressing the start/flip button. Pull the joystick forward to increase the speed of the closest tile as it klanks down the ramp. Push the joystick back and toss the top tile on the paddle back on the ramp and gain a little time.[CR]The paddle can hold up to five tiles. As long as the green light is on below the paddle, you can pile more tiles on the paddle. When the red light appears, you must flip at least one tile in a bin or toss it back on the ramp before you can collect any more tiles. You can flip tiles into a bin as long as the green light is on below the bin.[CR]To succeed in Klax, make points and also complete each wave. Create a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row of at least three tiles (just like in tic-tac-toe) in the bins to make a Klax and make points. You receive the most points for diagonals, less for horizontals and the least for verticals. When you create a Klax, the tiles in the Klax disappear to make room for more tiles in the bins.[CR]Each wave has a different task to be completed, which is shown on the To Go Meter. This task could be making a certain number of Klaxes or points or surviving a certain number of tiles. Complete the task before too many tiles drop in the pit and you complete the wave. When you complete a wave, you receive bonus points for the tiles remaining on the ramp, on the paddle, and any empty spaces in the bins. If you fail, you can start again at the same wave.[CR]Klax does not have a clock for you to race against, but as your playing time increases, the tiles klank down the ramp faster and faster.[CR]Waves : When you first enter the game, you can start at wave 1, 6, or 11. Wave 1 teaches you how to play the game and use the controls. At every fifth wave you can choose to play the next wave, the fifth wave beyond, or the tenth wave beyond.[CR]Klax has five different types of waves and more than five different backgrounds. There are five waves per level, and one hundred waves to complete.[CR]Each time you begin a wave, the To Go meter shows what kind of Klaxes or how many points you need to accumulate to complete the wave. The different types of waves are :[CR]* Klaxes To Go, which are the easiest. Just create Klaxes horizontally, vertically or horizontally. Create enough Klaxes to complete the wave before you drop too many tiles in the pit.[CR]* Tiles To Go requires you to survive a certain number of tiles. Create Klaxes in any of the three ways to collect points and to clear the bins to hold more tiles.[CR]* Points To Go requires you to make a certain number of points. Create Klaxes to collect points but make diagonals, four- or five-of-a-kind Klaxes, and simultaneous Klaxes for higher points.[CR]* Diagonals To Go requires you to create diagonals. Create Klaxes in any way to collect points; but only the correct number of diagonals will complete the wave.[CR]* Horizontals To Go requires you to create horizontals. Only horizontal Klaxes will complete the wave; but you can create Klaxes vertically and diagonally to collect points.[CR]You see several kinds of information on the screen. These are the :[CR]* To Go Meter which continuously calculates the number of Klaxes, tiles, points, diagonals or horizontals still required to complete the wave. The number depends on the type of wave you are playing.[CR]* Drop Count, which shows the number of dropped tiles. The drop count is continuously calculated. When the number of tiles dropped is reached, the wave is over.[CR]* High Score, which shows the highest score to date, regardless of the number of continues that player had.[CR]* Wave Indicator, which shows what wave you are playing.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Game ID : 136075[CR]Main CPU : Motorola 68000 (@ 7.15909 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : OKI6295 (@ 6.779 Khz)[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 1[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Even if title screen says 1989, Klax was released in February 1990.[CR]550 dedicated upright were produced in the USA and 451 in Ireland for European distribution.

The last space your piece falls does not contribute to this, however locking the piece once it has landed will add 1 to the Drop.[CR]Bravo is equal to 4 if this piece has cleared the screen, and otherwise is 1.[CR]Combo returns to 1 by default every time a piece does not clear lines. Otherwise, it is :[CR]Combo = Combo - 1 + (2 x Lines - 1)[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Conditions for Achieving the Grandmaster Grade : The higher you score, the better your grade will be. However, you need more than a high score to be graded a Grandmaster. You must be at least grade 1 when you reach level 300 and grade S4 when you reach level 500. Finally, you must be grade S9 and reach level 999 in under 13 minutes and 30 seconds (the tricky bit). Good luck![CR]* Basic Tips for Improving Speed :[CR]1) When a piece is touching your stack, tapping 'down', will lock it in place instantly, saving you a  fraction of a second. These really add up, so keep pushing the game forward as fast as you can handle![CR]2) It takes the same amount of time to clear a single line as it does to clear a double, triple, or Tetris, so try to be efficient and avoid clearing too many singles.[CR]3) Your level increases by 1 for every line you clear. It also increases by 1  for every piece that appears. However, when you are at levels 99, 199, 299, etc. your level will not increase from falling pieces. You MUST clear a line to proceed (and change the background). Every second you spend without clearing a line is wasted time, so keep an eye on your level and try to have a line ready for the right moment.[CR]4) If you intentionally keep your stack near the top of the screen it will take less time for pieces to fall and you will save time. This is most important at the beginning when pieces fall slowly, and again at level 200 when they slow to a crawl once more. By level 500, pieces will literally fall instantly and it will no longer make a difference how high your stack is.[CR]* Advanced Rotation Techniques :[CR]1) If you press and hold a rotate button before a piece appears, that piece will be rotated instantly as it appears in the field. The attract mode can give you a visual demonstration.[CR]2) When you are rotating a piece, if there are any blocks preventing a rotation then the game will then try to see if there is room for a rotated piece 1 square to the right, and failing that, 1 square to the left. It sounds subtle, but you can use this to get pieces into seemingly impossible locations. Study the visual demonstrations of this in the attract mode.[CR]* Predicting Upcoming Pieces :[CR]1) At the top of the screen, the next piece is displayed.[CR]2) Every piece has its own sound effect. Whenever a piece enters the screen, the sound of the upcoming piece is played. With practice, this knowledge can save you the effort of looking up to find out the next piece.[CR]3) The pieces you get are not purely random. The game keeps a history of the 4 most recent pieces, and every time the game "rolls" a new piece, it will reroll if this piece is found in the history. The game will keep trying to give you a piece not contained in your history, re-rolling as many as 4 times, before finally giving you whatever the last of these rolls happened to be. The implications of this are subtle: You are both unlikely to get flooded with many of the same piece, and unlikely to get starved of any particular piece. Overall the pieces come more regularly than other versions of Tetris, allowing the player to build bold structures (in expectation of upcoming pieces) that would be far too risky with purer randomization. It is also interesting to note that this version of Tetris, a game named after the Greek word for 'four' and using pieces constructed with 4 squares, also keeps a history of 4 pieces and will re-roll up to 4 times.[CR]4) The game will never give you an 'S', 'Z', or 'O' shape as your first piece. Also, every game begins with its history filled with 4 green 'Z' pieces, making these pieces initially unlikely. The odds of getting a Z shape as your second piece, for example, are fewer than 1/1000. Plan your opening moves accordingly.[CR]* Title Screen Codes : Enter these codes at the title screen for the desired effect...[CR]Big Mode (Pieces are much larger in size.) : Left(x4), Down, C, B, A.[CR]Mono Mode (Play the game in black and white.) : Right(x3), Up, C, B, A.[CR]TLS Mode (Pieces will still have shadows beyond lvl100) : A, B, C(x2), B, A(x2), C, B.[CR]Uki Mode (A Japanese child will laugh when you clear lines.) : A, B, A, B, A, B, A, B, A, B, A, B, A, B, A, B(x2).[CR]20G Mode (Starts the game with the highest gravity of 20 spaces per frame.) : Down(x8), C, B, A.[CR]Rev Mode (Pieces rise instead of falling as you play Tetris in reverse.) : Down, Up(x2), Down, C, B, A.[CR]* No Item Mode : To play a classic versus game without any items, hold down both player Start buttons when it says 'Here Comes a New Challenger'.[CR]* Another Hidden Game Mode : As you play, leave the bottom left square unfilled so that that line doesn't clear. Also, leave the square up one and right one unfilled so that the second line won't clear. Continue like this, leaving holes diagonally, until you reach the right wall. Then continue diagonally to the left wall. You should be making a pattern that looks like '&gt;'. It's actually rather hard to make the pattern entirely, but try to make as much as you can. After you die the game will recognize this pattern and give you an additional "Secret Grade", according to how much of the pattern you were able to make.

		<plot>Qix (c) 1981 Taito Corp.[CR]The objective of Qix is to claim a certain proportion of the playing field as your own. At the start of each level, the playing field is just a large, empty rectangle, containing the Qix - a stick-like entity that performs peculiar, erratic motions within the confines of the rectangle. The player controls a small marker that can move around the edges of the rectangle. To claim an area of the screen, the player must detach from an edge and draw Stix within the rectangle. Stix are simply lines traced out by moving the marker. When the marker traces out a closed shape, the area enclosed by the shape becomes solid and has been claimed. The player may draw either Fast Stix, which appear blue when solid, or Slow Stix, which appear red. Slow Stix take longer to draw, but are worth twice as many points. Once the player has claimed an area, the marker can safely move along the border of that claimed area. To complete a level, the player must claim 75% or more of the rectangle's area.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Board Number : LKN00003[CR]Prom Stickers : LK / QQ / QU / QX[CR]Main CPU : (2x) M6809 (@ 1.25 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU : M6802 (@ 921.6 Khz)[CR]Sound Chips : Discrete[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 4-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 2 (SLOW, FAST)[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Qix was released in October 1981.[CR]Also released as a cocktail model. In Japan, the cocktail version is known as "T.T Qix". [CR]The author named the game 'QIX' (pronounced 'KICKS' and not 'QUIX') because his car registration/number plate at the time was : 'JUS4QIX'.[CR]Qix is the first 'drawing game', a truly original game. Also the first totally Taito American game, Qix initially did big numbers, but quickly died when players discovered the machine was 'unbeatable'. Having a googolplex of possible combinations, there was no singular pattern to the game and players lost interest.[CR]A Qix unit appears in the 1983 movie 'Joysticks' and in the 1984 movie 'The Karate Kid'.[CR][B]Scoring[/B][CR]There are a couple of ways you earn points in Qix. The first involves actually claiming areas.[CR]There are 2 buttons, slow and fast. These buttons determine how fast your Marker goes. In essence, going slow increases the risk of losing your Marker so it is obviously worth more points. Here's how the points work out for making 'boxes':[CR]1) Slow : It is a base 500 points multiplied by the percentage of area covered by that box. For example, if you create a box that claims 3% of the total area, then points scored would be 500 X 3 or 1500 points. This area fills in with brown.[CR]2) Fast : It is a base 250 points multiplied by the percentage of area covered by that box. For example, if you create a box that claims 1% of the total area, then points scored would be 250 X 1 or 250 points. This area fills in with blue.[CR]NOTE : The above points may not be exact since the game rounds off the percentages to whole numbers for display but calculates them using decimal percentages.[CR]You also get bonus points for going above the 75% Threshold. Any percentage above the 75% Threshold is multiplied by 1000 to determine your bonus points.[CR]During the split Qix screens, if you successfully split the Qix's into their own compartments, you will get a multiplier bonus that is applied to points scored when you are making boxes. For example, if you had a 250 points and the multiplier was 3X, you now have 750 points. This multiplier increments by one every time you successfully split the Qix's. Of course, when you do this, you don't get the bonus points (if you had any).[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* When you start the game, your Marker will be at the bottom, middle of the playing screen. It is now up to you to start creating boxes. Keep in mind that you need to be constantly moving or the Sparx will take out your Marker. In addition, when you are moving your Marker around the perimeter, you can only move along the perimeter actually touching the Playing Field.[CR]* First of all, you must be constantly aware of two things. First, you must know where the Qix is located at all times. It moves randomly and can go anywhere on the Playing Field that your boxes haven't blocked. Last, the Sparx are constantly moving around the perimeter of the Playing Field. This can set up a dangerous situation where one Sparx is coming at you from one way and another from the other to make your Marker a 'Sparx Sandwich'.[CR]* Once you have assessed the danger, it is time to start making boxes. There are a few things to note when you are making boxes :[CR]a) When you start to draw the line, the Sparx cannot travel along the new perimeter you are creating until it is filled in.[CR]b) The Qix, though, is your primary concern. If it touches any part of a line before the box is filled in, you will lose your Marker.[CR]c) The box must begin and end either at a filled box or on the side of the Playing Field. You cannot connect the line to itself. If you try to do this, you will go into what is called a 'Spiral Death Trap' and a Fuse will follow your line to your Marker and destroy it.[CR]* After the fourth wave, the Qix will split in two. Now you have 2 Qix's bouncing around to deal with. You major goal is to actually 'split' the Qix's into their own areas. This means creating a series of boxes so that each Qix will be in its own compartment.[CR]* For maximum points, you must do two things :[CR]a) First, use the slow button as much as possible since this is where the points are.[CR]b) Try to claim as much area in each box as possible. That percentage multiplied by the speed value can yield some big point values.[CR]c) Constantly try to split the Qix's (if you can) to get that bonus multiplier even higher.[CR]d) When you are close to the Threshold, find an area in the Playing Field that hasn't really been touched and try to make a big box. That way, you will go over the 75% Threshold and claim a bonus.[CR]* As the waves progress, everything gets faster and the game will become less forgiving if you are less then committed to making a box.[CR]* Also, listen for sounds in this game. The only real sound you need to be concerned with is what sounds like a fuse being lit. If you are making a box and you hear this sound, that means you are taking too long or you have unfortunately gotten yourself into a 'Spiral Death Trap'. In the case of delay, once you move the fuse will go out.[CR]* To maximize points, draw narrow, tall boxes, like fingers, from the bottom.  When the Qix goes down between two fingers, go across the top of the fingers at slow speed. This tactic permits percentages of up to 99%.[CR]* It is possible create a 'slide-box' to avoid the sparks. Starting at a corner of a box, draw another box that connects only at that corner. When a spark approaches, the player can slide the diamond through the intersection, while the spark has to go around the perimeter. After the spark passes the intersection, the player can slide back across the intersection and be behind the spark.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1. Qix (1981, ARC)[CR]2.

		<plot>Block Out (c) 1989 Technos Japan Corp.[CR]Block Out is a 1-player or a simultaneous 2 players competitive game of unique dimensional action and strategy.[CR]As the blocks drop one-by-one into the three-dimensional pit, rotate them by using the three buttons and joystick. Once the player has decided on the the rotation of the block, use the button to drop the block into place. The objective is to place the blocks into the pit without leaving any empty spaces. Once this is achieved, the layers without empty spaces, will disappear.[CR]The player begins the game by selecting a starting stage. Game start level select can be chosen from stages 1, 5, 10, 15, or 20. There is a total of 100 stages in the game and as the players progress through the game, the stages get more and more difficult.[CR]Each stage has a certain number of layers (faces) that must be erased. Once these faces are erased, the player will move on to the next stage. The less blocks the players has left in the pit at the end of the stage, the more points are awarded.[CR]In addition to the one player mode, Block Out offers a competitive simultaneous two player mode. The split screen effect gives each player their own pit with which to play in. They compete against each other in the race to erase the faces. As one player erases a face, that face will be added to the opponent's pit, making their pit rise. This allows less room to work. There are two ways to win in the 2-player mode :[CR]1) Force the opponent to the top of their pit and out of the game[CR]or[CR]2) Erase 21 faces first.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Game ID : TA-0029[CR]Main CPU : Motorola 68000 (@ 10 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 3.579545 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : Yamaha YM2151 (@ 3.579545 Mhz), OKI6295 (@ 8 Khz)[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 4[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Developed by California Dreams.[CR]Released in October 1989.[CR]The name 'Block Out' is actually a trademark of Kadon Enterprises.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]If the player can erase all of the blocks in the pit, this will make a 'block out'.

		<plot>Magical Drop III (c) 1997 Data East.[CR]More characters, more gameplay modes, more frantic gameplay, more fun! This is what every videogame sequel should be, and the sequel to one of the best puzzle games for the Neo-Geo MVS is indeed a game not to be missed! Lots of fun for one or two players![CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the SNK "Neo-Geo MVS" hardware.[CR]Game ID: NGM-233[CR]Players: 2[CR]Control: 8-Way Joystick[CR]Buttons: 3[CR]=&gt; [A] Catch Balloons, [B] Throw Balloons, [C] Shift the balloons a line down[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Magical Drop III was released on February 25, 1997. This is Data East's final arcade video game. [CR]The game now features parodies of all the characters featured in the 22 cards of the major Arcana in a Tarot card deck. These are numbered from 0 to 21 as follows : [CR]00. Fool [CR]01. Magician [CR]02. High Priestess [CR]03. Emperor [CR]04. Empress [CR]05. Hierophant [CR]06. Lovers [CR]07. Chariot [CR]08. Strength [CR]09. Hermit [CR]10. (Wheel of) Fortune [CR]11. Justice [CR]12. Hanged Man [CR]13. Death [CR]14. Temperance [CR]15. Devil [CR]16. Tower [CR]17. Star [CR]18. Moon [CR]19. Sun [CR]20. Judgement [CR]21. World [CR]Note that the only exception to this statement would be Black Pierrot since he does not appear in a Tarot card deck. Black Pierrot is an added bonus character to challenge really good Magical Drop 3 pros! [CR]Note : In puzzle and adventure modes, only 8 characters are available : Fool, High Priestess, Emperor, Lovers, Chariot, Strength, Justice and Star. [CR]Default highscore table : [CR]Name Score Reactions Time [CR]1ST D.E 5000 8 06:00 [CR]2ND D.E 4500 7 05:30 [CR]3RD D.E 4000 6 05:00 [CR]4TH D.E 3500 5 04:30 [CR]5TH D.E 3000 4 04:00 [CR]Soundtrack releases (for limited edition): [CR]Magical Drop III - Pony Canyon / Scitron - PCCBX-00002 - March 21, 1997[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]The Japanese version of this game features LOTS of stuff unavailable in any other version :[CR]* In Challenge Mode there is a story intro at the beginning explaining the reason behind the Magical Drop competition, an extra animation showing a close-up of the Magical Drop book as it opens,  an ending for each character available in the game, a "Hard" difficulty setting, as well as a bonus fortune reading when you beat the Challenge Mode or you lose against the CPU and  refuse to continue. All of this is absent in the USA &amp; Europe versions.[CR]* In Challenge Mode, each character has a unique set of quotes before a battle begins, this even applies in the battles against the end bosses Tower &amp; Fortune. In the USA &amp; Europe versions there are only two possible quotes before a fight for all characters :[CR]Quote #1[CR]CPU : Get out of my way![CR]Player : I'll never lose to you! [CR]Quote #2[CR]CPU : You want to fight?[CR]Player : Now let's see who is better![CR]* In Adventure mode, each character has its very own story intro as well as its very own ending which is different from the one seen in Challenge mode. Additionally this mode plays like a board game in which you compete against three other characters on the board, and if any of the others get to Empress' castle before your character, you will get a generic bad ending. If you arrive on a tile already occupied by a CPU-controlled character, you will have 2 options :[CR]1) The option on the right : you don't want to trouble and ignore the opponent (sometimes you will have to back off 1 tile)[CR]2) The option on the left : you fight the opponent. If you win, he or she will be eliminated but it would be the same for you if you fail, so be careful![CR]In the USA and European versions, there is no storyline and the only character on the board is controlled by the player. [CR]* Like in the previous game, each character has his/her own unique voice. The European version features less voice tracks and the USA version features a single voice track for all characters.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Play as Father Strength : At the character select screen, highlight Strength, hold C and press A or B. This trick does not work nor in puzzle mode nor in adventure mode. [CR]* Play with bonus characters : At the character select screen, highlight any character (Except World, World's number is 21 so she can't be used for this trick) and wait until the timer counts down to the number assigned to that character : [CR]00 - Fool [CR]01 - Magician [CR]02 - High Priestess [CR]03 - Empress [CR]04 - Emperor [CR]05 - Hierophant [CR]06 - Lovers [CR]07 - Chariot [CR]08 - Strength [CR]11 - Justice [CR]13 - Death [CR]15 - Devil [CR]17 - Star [CR]19 - Sun [CR]20 - Judgment [CR]Then push C only three times. Moon, Hanged Man, Hermit, Temperance, Tower and Fortune will appear and will now be selectable. This trick does neither work in puzzle mode nor in adventure mode. [CR]* Secret Stages : [CR]1) Moon (after Level 6) : Finish the sixth stage without exceeding 90 seconds since the beginning. [CR]2) Hanged Man (after Level 6) : Finish the sixth stage exceeding 300 seconds since the beginning. [CR]3) Black Pierrot (after Level 10) : Finish the tenth stage with at least 150000 points.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1. Magical Drop (1995, Arcade)[CR]2. Magical Drop Plus 1! (1995, Arcade)[CR]3.

As long as you do not get hit, the diamonds will continue to go up in value until they finally reach 10,000 each. Grabbing the sacks will add multipliers (2X, 4X, up to 8X) that will further increase your score.[CR]* There are many cracks in the wood/stone of most levels. Some of these will reveal a fireball that will make your shot fly all over the board. Experiment with throwing at different angles to find these hidden spots. Most will clear the entire board as the ball flings out of control.[CR][B]Staff[/B][CR]Programmer : Hisanori Takeuchi (AM FACTORY)[CR]Graphic designers : Hiroshi Yokoyama, Masayuki Taguchi, Tsuyoshi Yoneyama, Taketumi Watanabe (ELEVEN)[CR]Sound composer : Kim[CR]Data convert : Tatsuya Watanabe (PAON)[CR]Director : Akihiko Uto[CR]</plot>

		<plot>Solomon's Key - Solomon no Kagi (c) 1986 Tecmo.[CR]A superb and addictive platform/puzzle game in which a single player controls a wizard called 'Dana', whose quest is to retrieve "Solomon's key" and vanquish the demon hordes that have broken through into the world. To achieve this Dana must advance through the fifty rooms of 'Constellation Space', before finally reaching the magical key.[CR]Each room has a key that Dana must collect. Once collected, the room's exit will open and the wizard must then try to find and/or create a safe route past the constantly spawning demons to reach the exit and progress to the next room. To enable him to do this, Dana is armed with a magic wand that can be used to both destroy and create granite blocks to use as platforms and barriers. Dana can remove existing blocks with his wand, and can remove blocks directly above him by repeatedly jumping up into them until they shatter.[CR]Bonus Items litter each room, as well as being hidden in granite blocks, and collecting these will earn the player for extra points. Power-ups can also be found and picked up. These appear as potion bottles with a flame emblazoned on them. When used, Dana shoots a fireball which will start moving along the walls and platforms and will destroy the first demon it comes into contact with.[CR]As well as the bonus items and power-ups, each level also has a hand bell which, when collected, will trigger the release of a trapped fairy. The fairy will slowly fly around the room and can be rescued for bonus points. An extra life is awarded for every ten fairies rescued.[CR]The game's levels are set around the Zodiac star constellations. The main levels are divided into groups of four - making a total of fourty-eight standard rooms - with each group representing a separate constellation. In addition to the standard rooms, each constellation also has a secret bonus room that can only be accessed by finding the given constellation's 'Seal', which is located in the last room of each group. There are three further secret rooms - 'Page of Time', 'The Page of Space' and the 'Princess Room' - that are only accessible if the player has found the 'Hidden Seals of Solomon'.[CR]The four room groups are :[CR]1-4 Aries 5-8 Taurus 9-12 Gemini[CR]13-16 Cancer 17-20 Leo 21-24 Scorpio[CR]25-28 Libra 29-32 Virgo 33-36 Sagittarius[CR]37-40 Capricorn 41-44 Aquarius 45-48 Pisces[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Main CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 4 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 3.072 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : (3x) General Instrument AY8910 (@ 1.5 Mhz)[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 2 (CREATE BLOCK/DESTROY BLOCK/SWAP KEY, MAGIC)[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Released in July 1986.[CR]The subtitle of this game translates from Japanese as 'Key of Solomon'.[CR][B]Scoring[/B][CR]Blue bag I : 100 points.[CR]Blue bag II : 200 points.[CR]Blue bag V : 500 points.[CR]Red bag I : 1000 points.[CR]Red bag II : 2000 points.[CR]Red bag V : 5000 points.[CR]Green bag I : 10000 points.[CR]Green bag II : 20000 points.[CR]Blue gem : 500 points.[CR]Red gem : 5000 points.[CR]Coin : 1000 points.[CR]Double coin : 2000 points.[CR]Star coin : 10000 points.[CR]Double star coin : 20000 points.[CR]Gold bar : 100 points.[CR]Gold ruby : 200 points.[CR]Green cross : 50000 points.[CR]Question mark : 100000~1000000 points.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Secret rooms : shoot the key to change its color...[CR]Room 3-3 : Red Key -&gt; Room 4-1 (normal), Blue Key -&gt; Room 3-4 (secret room)[CR]Room 5-6 : Red Key -&gt; Room 6-1 (normal), Blue Key -&gt; Room 5-7 (secret room)[CR]Room 6-6 : Red Key -&gt; Room 7-1 (normal), Blue Key -&gt; Room 6-7 (secret room)[CR]Room 7-2 : Green Key -&gt; Room 7-4 (normal), Blue Key -&gt; Room 7-3 (secret room)[CR]Room 8-6 : Red Key -&gt; Room 9-1 (normal), Blue Key -&gt; 8-7 (secret room)[CR]Room 9-6 : Red Key -&gt; Room 10-2 (normal), Blue Key -&gt; Room 9-7 (secret room)[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

		<plot>Warlords (c) 1980 Atari.[CR]Atari's Warlords depicts a third-person view of four castles. The player-controlled Warlords and computer-controlled Black Knights use shields to defend their castle walls from the fireballs that ricochet around the playfield. [CR]Players can capture and catapult the fireballs at opposing castles, using their shield control and 'Power Stone' pushbutton. When a fireball hits a castle wall, it destroys one or more bricks, depending on its speed. [CR]A castle not paid for is controlled by the computer, with a Black Knight displayed in the appropriate castle. The Black Knights catapult fireballs at the players with increasing accuracy, to provide challenge. [CR]Game play begins when any start button is pressed and the countdown has ended. The game ends when the last Warlord's castle (containing a crown) has been penetrated by a fireball. At this point a white cloud envelopes the crown, and the latter disappears. [CR]During the countdown, a dragon flies back and forth across the screen with a fireball in its mouth. At the end of the countdown, a position activated by a start button has its Black Knight changed to a Warlord's crown. A position not activated remains as a Black Knight and is controlled by the computer. The dragon then spits the fireball from its mouth toward a Warlord's castle. [CR]The objective is to destroy the three other castles, while protecting one's own castle with the moving shield. The LED pushbuttons have dual functions: in the ready-to-play mode they work as start switches, and during game play they become 'Power Stones' to allow players to capture and catapult fireballs at opponents. [CR]The spinning fireballs released from a shield have more destructive force on a castle wall than a fireball simply deflected from another wall or the sides of the playfield. However, players will soon find out that they cannot hold onto a fireball for long, since it slowly destroys their own castle walls adjacent to the fireball. [CR]Additional fireballs appear at predetermined intervals or when a castle is destroyed, whichever comes first. A maximum of four fireballs simultaneously appear on the screen. [CR]In 1- and 2-player games, the Warlords' crowns will be accompanied by a zero, to begin scoring. The point-scoring system is printed on each control panel (the Black Knights do not earn points). [CR]If a Black Knight has the surviving castle, the game ends. However, if a Warlord has the surviving castle, that player receives bonus points, all castles are rebuilt, and the game continues with a new battle at a higher level. In a 2-player game, both players continue in the game, but only one player can get bonus points. If both Black Knights are eliminated first and only Warlords remain, the level becomes a free-for-all between the two Warlords until one is eliminated. The other Warlord then gets the bonus points, and the game begins again. [CR]The subsequent levels begin, as mentioned before, with the fireball thrown out by the dragon. In the higher levels, Black Knights play more accurately and faster. [CR]3- and 4-player games (available in the cocktail version only) are free-for-alls. No scores are kept, and the game ends as soon as there is only one castle left.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR][Upright model][CR]Game ID : 037153-037159[CR]The upright version only supports up to 2 players and uses a 23" black-and-white raster-scan monitor with a color overlay and a mirrored 3-D colored playfield. Only the two lower castles are available for play; the two upper castles will always have Black Knights in them.[CR]Main CPU : MOS Technology M6502 (@ 1.512 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : POKEY (@ 1.512 Mhz)[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : paddle[CR]Buttons : 1 (Power Stone)[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Warlords was released in April 1980.

		<plot>Metal Slug - Super Vehicle-001 (c) 1996 Nazca.[CR]A scrolling 'run-and-gun' platform game for one or two players, Metal Slug is a humorous parody of war and specifically of World War II and the Nazis.[CR]The game features six enemy-packed levels, referred to as 'missions'. Players start the game armed only with a pistol, but extra weapons can be picked up and used for greater firepower. Also, at certain points during a level players will find an unused 'Super Vehicle-001' - or Metal Slug - tank which can be entered and driven. The Metal Slug is slow-moving but has very powerful weapons. If the Slug takes too many hits it will break down and start to flash, the player must then quickly exit the vehicle before it explodes. The enemy troops also have vehicles at their disposal, such as tanks, boats and helicopters.[CR]The levels are littered with bearded hostages who, when rescued, award players with either points bonuses (in the form of medals) or weapon power-ups. Available weapons are Heavy Machine Gun, Flame Shot, Rocket Launcher and Shotgun. Hand grenades are also available.[CR]Each level ends with at least one large enemy 'Boss' vehicle that takes many hits to destroy. Once the boss has been destroyed, bonus points are awarded for each prisoner rescued. Further bonus points are awarded if the player's Metal Slug vehicle has survived the boss battle.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the SNK "Neo-Geo MVS" hardware.[CR]Game ID : 0201[CR]Main CPU : Motorola 68000 (@ 12 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 4 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : Yamaha YM2610 (@ 8 Mhz)[CR]Screen orientation : Horizontal[CR]Video resolution : 320 x 224 pixels[CR]Screen refresh : 59.19 Hz[CR]Palette colors : 4096[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 3[CR]=&gt; Character &gt; [A] Shoot, [B] Jump, [C] Grenade[CR]=&gt; Metal Slug&gt; [A] Gun Attack, [B] Jump Board Vehicle, [C] Artillery Attack[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Metal Slug was released in April 1996. [CR]Etymology of 'Metal Slug': Meeher, the lead designer of the game for Nazca, wanted to create an armored fighting vehicle that could crawl on the ground like a 'slug'. The word 'metal' in the title indicates that the vehicle is mechanical. Initially, players considered the title to be "not good enough". Meeher later joked about the title, saying "Maybe I don't make much [sic] of a sense?" [CR]Slugs in Metal Slug sequels included animals (usually only the Vulcan cannon mounted on the animal, with a cannon attachment occasionally available), planes and other vehicles that did not fit Meeher's original definition. [CR]While being an obvious parody of World War II and the Nazi regime (the rebel army's flag is a deliberate pastiche of the Nazi "Swastika"), Metal Slug also lampoons 'Full Metal Jacket' and 'MASH'. General Morden, the rebel army's evil general, is a parody of Saddam Hussein. [CR]Just as the two main heroes (Marco &amp; Tarma) appear in every chapter in the Metal Slug series, General Morden &amp; Allen O' Neill (the machine gun wielding, trash mouth-talking, buffed soldier) are the series' classic main villains.[CR]The tank in Metal Slug was inspired by the tank: Dominio Tank Police (1988). The tank in this anime is called Bonaparte and is piloted by Leona Ozaki.[CR]Cliff Reese holds the official record for this game with 2,683,030 points on March 8, 2011. [CR]The same team that created Metal Slug had previously created a handful of games for Irem, most of which featured very similar graphics and gameplay. "Cyber Lip" (1990) had some of the core developers as the original Metal Slug. "Gunforce" (1991) and "In the Hunt" (1993) had noticeably similar gameplay, with graphics that bear a slight resemblance to Metal Slug. "Gunforce 2" (1994) not only had similar gameplay but the sounds of dying soldiers were almost exactly the same as Metal Slug. Because of this, some fans refer to Gunforce 2 as "Metal Slug Zero".[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Metal Slug features a 'blood ON' option (soldiers squirt blood when shot, instead of water). This can be activated via the 'Setting The Soft Dip' option in the game's dip switch menu. [CR]* When you parachute into the level at the start of a mission, press B to make the parachute disappear, allowing your character to drop to the ground more quickly. [CR]* Don't waste ammo. Metal Slug requires some thinking and shooting indiscriminately is not the best way to play this game. [CR]* Don't waste special weapons on shields. Shielded soldiers will throw their shields aside when they need to fire, so shoot at them only at this instant. Or use your knife if you manage to get close enough. [CR]* Use your knife against lone enemies. There is no need to waste ten rounds of your Heavy Machine Gun on a single enemy soldier. [CR]* When Metal Slug is dangerously low on health (but not so low that you are forced to leave it), use the frontal attack to inflict major damage. [CR]* Whenever you jump out of the slug, you are invincible for a brief amount of time. This is especially useful against the blue mortars, since they can't be avoided. Note, however, that there is no period of invincibility when you jump back into the slug. [CR]* There is apparently no 'reload time' when you throw grenades or rockets. The rate depends on how many of either are currently on-screen so if you are close to an enemy, the rate will be negligible. You may use this trick against some bosses and in any other situation to pass through unscratched. [CR]* The best way to earn points in to rescue hostages, but this can be tricky. The first problem is finding them, the second is to stay alive to the end of the mission to get credit for your rescues. [CR]As well as the easily-spotted hostages that litter the levels, there are also numerous hidden hostages: [CR]MISSION 1 (hostages: 10): [CR]Two pairs of are hostages hidden in the two waterfalls just before you get to the boss. Just blast the tops of the waterfalls and they will fall. [CR]MISSION 2 (hostages: 12): [CR]Blast down at the green bush underneath the bridge just before you reach the mid level boss (large tank on rails above you) and three secret prisoners will come running in your direction. [CR]MISSION 3 (hostages: 15): [CR]There are secret hostages hidden within the two large trees that you can blast down in the section where you have the Metal Slug tank. These seem to be random, just try blasting those trees down and sometimes they appear. [CR]There are hidden hostages that drop down from the sky when you are fighting the end of level boss; just don't kill the boss until they have all appeared. [CR]MISSION 4 (hostages: 20): [CR]Just after you have got the Metal Slug tank at the beginning of the level, blast the ceiling of the bar just above the light/lampshade high up on the wall at the entrance of the bar. [CR]At the end of level bosses you can either blast in the top right hand corner of the cave to get three hidden hostages OR blast the far bottom left hand corner for three hidden hostages. It is not possible to get both of these groups. You can only get one or the other. [CR]MISSION 5 (hostages: 13):[CR]Blast the first and second houses and two hostages will appear. [CR]Fire at the top of the first and second trees in the stage in between the shops and houses.

		<plot>X-Men (c) 1992 Konami.[CR]X-Men is a side-scrolling beat-em-up for up to four players. The X-Men's mission is to find and rescue Professor X, who has been captured by evil mutants and is now being held prisoner by Magneto.[CR]Each X-Man character has an 'Attack', 'Jump' and 'Mutant Power' button. The mutant power attack is a powerful special move unique to each X-Man. While it inflicts a lot of damage on the enemies, the trade-off is that each usage removes 3 bars from the players health meter (a full meter has 10 bars). Each level ends with a face-off against a powerful mutant boss character.[CR]The game has six stages, with the final one set on 'Asteroid M', Magneto's base. The defeated mutant bosses from the previous levels each make an appearance (albeit in a less powerful form) before the final encounter with Magneto himself.[CR]Players can chose from 6 X-Men characters, they are:[CR]Cyclops [CR]Colossus [CR]Wolverine [CR]Storm [CR]Nightcrawler [CR]Dazzler[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Game ID : GX065[CR][4-Player model][CR]Main CPU : Motorola 68000[CR]Sound CPU : Zilog Z80[CR]Sound Chips : Yamaha YM2151, K054539[CR]Players : 4[CR]Control : 8-Way Joystick[CR]Buttons : 3[CR]=&gt; Attack, Jump, Mutant Power Attack[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]X-Men was released in April 1992. [CR]X-Men is based upon the comic book series of the same name (most of the game's plot is loosely based on the 1989 X-Men cartoon called 'Pryde Of The X-Men'). Here are the debut comics for all Marvel characters from this game including non-playable characters : [CR]Cyclops (aka Scott Summers) - X-Men #1 [CR]Colossus (aka Piotr Nikolaievitch Rasputin) - Giant-Size X-Men #1 [CR]Wolverine (aka James 'Logan' Howlett) - Incredible Hulk #180 [CR]Storm (aka Ororo Munroe) - Giant Size X-Men #1 [CR]Nightcrawler (aka Kurt Wagner) - Giant Size X-Men #1 [CR]Dazzler (aka Alison Blaire) - X-Men #130 [CR]Professor X (aka Charles Francis Xavier) - X-Men #1 [CR]Shadowcat (aka Katherine 'Kitty' Pryde) - X-Men #129 [CR]The Sentinels - X-Men #14 [CR]Bonebreaker - Uncanny X-Men #229 [CR]Pyro (aka St. John Allerdyce - Level 1 boss) - Uncanny X-Men 141 [CR]The Blob (aka Fred J.

[CR]Although "Final Fight" set the standard for scrolling fighters. Konami's X-Men created several innovations for the genre, including the ability to hit fallen opponents to prevent them from getting back up, as well as a character-specialized 'mutant power', which could clear the screen of enemies, but also reduced the player's health. The game is fondly remembered by those who played it for its fun, addicting game-play and colorful graphics. However, it is also sometimes criticized for its wooden voice acting and often ungrammatical script ('I am Magneto, Master of Magnet'). [CR]Bill Toups holds the official official record for this game with 830 points on June 11, 2004. [CR]King Records released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Konami All Stars 1993 - KICA-9016, 9018) on December 21, 1992.

		<plot>Double Dragon (c) 1987 Technos Japan Corp.[CR]Double Dragon is a side-scrolling beat-em-up for one or two players, featuring twin brothers and martial arts masters, "Billy &amp; Jimmy Lee". The brothers must defeat the savage street gang known as the 'Black Warriors' to rescue Billy's kidnapped girlfriend, Marian. Standing between the brothers and Marian are four huge, colorful and varied levels; each populated with a wide variety of thugs.[CR]Many of the game's enemies carry weapons (knives, baseball bats etc.) and should Billy or Jimmy manage to knock the weapons from the enemies' hands, the heroes can pick the weapons up and use them against the enemies.[CR]The Black Warriors is made up of six distinct enemy characters- plus Willy, the game's final boss - with each differing in both physical appearance and fighting style. The members of the Black Warriors consist of the following fighters: [CR]* Williams - A street punk in a tank top. In addition to the standard punches and jump kicks, his signature technique is a body blow to the stomach. He also wields weapons such as baseball bats, knives and dynamite sticks.[CR]* Rowper - A punk who wears matching-colored pants and shirtless vest. He wields all the same weapons as Williams, but can also lift and throw heavy objects such as oildrums, boxes and stones.[CR]* Linda - Female punk who usually carries a whip. She's not very strong, as she falls down to ground with a couple of punches or a single kick (because of this, she is the only regular-sized enemy who cannot be placed on a headlock).[CR]* Abobo - A tall, big-muscled bald guy. His attacks includes punches, a standing kick and a body toss. He can also lift and throw heavy objects like Rowper. Due to his large size, he cannot be put into a headlock.[CR]* Boss 1 - The first boss, a head-swap of Abobo with a Mr. T-style mohawk and beard. Fights just like Abobo, only with an added double-handed slap. Unlike Abobo, he does not use weapons. A green version of him appears as the Mission 3 boss.[CR]* Boss 2 - The second boss. A head swap of the player who uses almost all the same techniques. [CR]* Willy - The game's final boss, armed, somewhat unfairly, with a machine-gun.[CR]Double Dragon was a huge success due to the many game-play innovations it brought to the genre (see TRIVIA for details), but it demonstrates its final moment of inspired genius at the very end of the game. Should both players still be alive after the final boss has been defeated, they will then have to fight each OTHER. The winner of this fight will be the one who wins Marian's affections.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Game ID : TA-0021[CR]Main CPU : HD6309, Hitachi HD63701[CR]Sound CPU : HD6309[CR]Sound Chips : Yamaha YM2151, (2x) MSM5205[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 3[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Double Dragon was released in August 1987.[CR]Double Dragon may not have been the world's first side-scrolling beat-em-up to feature depth-movement (that accolade belongs to its predecessor, "Renegade", released in 1986) but it is the world's first CO-OPERATIVE fighting game and as such completely revolutionized its genre.[CR]The varied, multi-colored sprites and hugely detailed backdrops - married to instinctive, one or two-player game-play - was something that had never really been seen in the fighting game before and Double Dragon quickly became a legend in its own right. The game would be the inspiration for an entire genre and classics such as Capcom's "Final Fight" owe a huge debt of gratitude to the Technos legend. The game was such a huge hit, that when the home versions finally came out, the rear side of the package advertised, 'You'll never have to stand in line to play Double Dragon again!'.[CR]Double Dragon's hugely innovative game-play and superb graphics proved to be too ambitious for the host Technos hardware and the game was plagued with the now notorious 'slowdown', that occurred whenever a large number of fighters appeared on-screen.[CR]The game's director, Yoshihisa Kishimoto, reportedly conceived his initial idea for Double Dragon around the date of July 20th in 1986, the 13th anniversary of Bruce Lee's death.[CR]Director Yoshihisa Kishimoto got the idea of picking up an enemy's weapon from his previous game, "Renegade" ("Nekketsu Kouha Kunio-kun" in Japan). During the first stage of Renegade, he noticed that the armed enemy characters were not holding their weapons when they were on the ground.[CR]On the first stage of the game, a billboard for "Nekketsu Kouha Kunio-kun" (the Japanese version of "Renegade") can be seen atop a building prior to the first boss battle.[CR]The car at Billy and Jimmy's garage resembles the interceptor from the laserdisc game "Road Blaster", which was one of director Yoshihisa Kishimoto's previous games at Data East before he left the company to work for Technos.[CR]The three kanji (Chinese characters) on the title screen, which is normally read as "Sou-Setsu-Ryuu", literally means "Twin Interception Dragon". This is an example of 'gikun', in which a kanji is used for their meaning and not their phonetic value.[CR]The fictional martial arts practiced by the Lee brothers is called Sousetsuken or 'Twin Interception Fist', which is described as a combination of Shaolin Temple Kung Fu, Karate and Tai Chi Chuan. The name is derived from Bruce Lee's own martial arts style Jeet Kune Do, or Sekkendou in Japanese, which is known as the 'Way of the Intercepting Fist'.[CR]The Lee brothers, along with the recurring enemy characters Williams and Rowper, were named after the three main heroes from the 1973 Bruce Lee film, 'Enter the Dragon'.[CR]Double Dragon contained a number of bugs, most of which were never fixed despite several revisions of the ROM. The best known is a bug in the way enemies attack the player. Sportingly, enemies will not attack the player from behind, but will instead walk up to them and try to move past so they can attack from the front. Thus, by standing with your back to an enemy, it was possible to wait for them to get close and then elbow them in the face, without fear of being attacked. Another common bug was the 'infinite bouncing' bug. Due to the fixed way in which objects in the game would bounce off walls, trees etc., it was possible to drop an item between two tree stumps on the forest level, and it would bounce back and forth forever. In the first version of the game, this could happen to player characters who fell off either stump, the only way to continue the game being to allow the timer to run down. Another less serious bug was the ability to throw weapons from one level to the next. Usually, weapons were discarded at the end of a level. On some levels however, the transition to the next level was achieved simply by scrolling the screen one whole screen to the right, or down a cliff. By standing at the extreme right of the level and jumping just as it ended, the players character would drop their weapon in mid air, throwing it far enough to be picked up again once the screen had scrolled on.[CR]Jason Wilson holds the official record for this game with 171,210 points on July 24, 1999.[CR]Apollon Music released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Original Sound of Double Dragon - KHY-1026) in cassette format on 21/02/1988. Also released the soundtrack album in CD format (Original Sound of Double Dragon - BY12-5028) on 16/12/1988.[CR]Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Legend of Game Music 2 ~Platinum Box~ - SCDC-00473~82) on 18/01/2006[CR]A Double Dragon unit appears in the abysmal 1994 movie 'Double Dragon'.[CR]A Double Dragon unit can be seen in Drake and Josh episode 'Movie Job', but the marquee reads 'Dragon'.[CR]Tiger Electronics released a board-game based on this video game (same name) in 1989 : The winner is the first player to successfully fight his or her way around the game board to Jimmy's Hideout to rescue Marian. You will pass through the slum section, the industrial section, the forest section and the hideout section on the rocky road to victory.[CR]Comic Book : Six-issue limited series published by Marvel Comics in 1991. (cover dated from July to December). Written by Dwayne McDuffie for the first four issues and by Tom Brevoort and Mike Kanterovich for the final two. In this comic, Billy and Jimmy Lee were the twin inheritors of the 'Dragon Force', a mystical force that granted the Lee brothers their powers, as they fought against the occult crime lord Nightfall. Marian is reimagined as a policewoman (a depiction later featured in the cartoon series) and Stan Lee appears as Billy and Jimmy's long-lost father.[CR]Cartoon : TV series produced by DIC Entertainment and Bohbot Entertainment, which lasted two 13-episodes seasons in 1993 and 1994. In the series, Billy and Jimmy are twin brothers who were separated at birth, with Billy being raised by his father's sensei, the Oldest Dragon, while Jimmy was raised by the evil Shadow Master to become his successor, the Shadow Boss. After the second episode, Jimmy realizes the evils of his way and joins his brother, becoming the Double Dragons. Inspired the 1994 home console fighting game "Double Dragon V: The Shadow Falls".[CR]Live-Action Movie : Released in 1994 by Imperial Entertainment. Starred Scott Wolf as Billy, Mark Dacascos as Jimmy, Alysa Milano as Marian and Robert Patrick as original villain Koga Shuko. Directed by James Yukich, with a screenplay written by Paul Dini (of Batman: The Animated Series) and Neal Shusterman. In the movie, Billy and Jimmy are young twin brothers who possess one half of a magical medallion, with the other half possessed by crime lord Shuko. It inspired the 1995 Neo-Geo game "Double Dragon".[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Here's How To Get Infinite Points In Double Dragon : Level One, one player grabs the whip when it comes out. The other player relieves the enemy who walks out with a bat of that bat. But he does NOT kill that enemy. Continue moving on until you're at the end of stage one. At this point the player WITHOUT the whip grabs the now bat-less enemy. The other player finishes the stage. Note that when the boss man is dead, the clock stops running down. Then the player tortures the bat-less one with the whip. 200 points per pop, and the enemy will NEVER die. Switch to non-whip attack to kill him, and resume normal play.[CR]* To easily get through the whole game, use the following strategy. When an opponent is coming towards you from one direction, face the opposite direction. When the enemy is at arm's length, do an elbow smash. The enemy will go flying forward. While the opponent is still on the ground, face away from him/her and repeat the process. Now, you can defeat enemies without them attacking. This strategy also works for bosses.[CR]* Ghost Player : Notice that player one gets all the points for certain weapons. Notably the barrel, which is important because it is reusable. Should player one die, while player two is still alive, player one continues to get points for the barrel. If this gets him over the extra-man mark, he gets a ghost player, which is limited in the kinds of things he can do.[CR]* Infinite Knives : When an enemy carrying a knife appears on the screen (NOT an enemy that picks up a knife, but one already carrying the knife when he appears), instead of taking the knife beating the enemy, hit the weapon, causing the enemy to drop it (or let it hit a wall). Doing this you will be able to pick up and use the knife against some other enemies, while the character bearing the knife will take out a new one so you can repeat the trick. You can use this same trick with dynamite.[CR]* At the end of some levels you can throw your weapons onto the next stage. Normally you discard them, but you can cheat. This works well on level 1, for instance. When at the end of the level, just after you kill the boss, move to the extreme right of the level, as far as it will scroll. Jump up just as the level ends and scrolls to the next one, if you time it right you will let go of your weapon in mid air and it will fall onto the next stage where you can just about pick it up at the very left of the screen![CR]* Throw Objects Through the Levels : At the end of the second stage, where the elevator appears, move as far down as possible without falling. Now, when you drop weapons, or hit some enemies, these will fall off-screen instead of falling to the ground. If fallen objects like whips  or knifes fall into a certain area (near the platform), you will find them when descending into Mission 3.[CR]* Throw Enemies Into the Void : At the beginning of Mission 3 you will face two enemies; make them come as near to the left of the screen as possible, and throw them off-screen; they will die immediately as if falling into the 'void'.[CR]* At the last level after the walls you will see two guys. Kill the first one and let the second guy on wait. Now you have only one guy in front of the door waiting for you. Just pass him by and when he comes turn fast and give him a punch to turn his head. Now you crash his head. To go back to normal you have to have a second player to catch his back.[CR]* At the very end of the last stage you will notice the machine-gun man looking down on you nodding his head. Normally he will walk down when you have killed a few more hench men. Well if you can entice the BIG guy that throws you over his head towards the wall. Elbow him so he is on the ground facing the wall, at this point stand at his feet and he will throw you on the wall next to the machine gun man. You can then beat the crap out of the machine gun man with his gun on the wall still.[CR]* How to kill the final boss (Willy) in just one hit (also useful to quickly kill the other enemies in the final part of the last level) : This trick requires a lot of dexterity and skill (and a bit of luck too, as it won't work if the enemies won't lean out enough) to be achieved. In the last level, after you kill the two mohawked giants that show up smashing the wall, exploit the edge near the wall on the left to lean out downwards as much as possible (you'd better do it here and now, as later on it will become almost impossible to lean out so much without falling), then move forward and keep fighting while remaining on this edge.[CR]When Willy comes out of the steel door, wait for him to come down to the lower side of the screen; as soon as he leans out downwards enough, hit him and make him fall (be careful in using flying kicks, as you risk to fall on the spikes). If performed with the correct timing, Willy will NOT fall on the ground: he'll fall straight on the spikes, dying at once.[CR]Note : if you use this trick on all the other enemies that show up before Willy, sometimes, after the final boss is thrown in the spikes, an enemy will jump out of the spikes, and fall on them straight afterwards.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

		<plot>Sunset Riders (c) 1991 Konami.[CR]Sunset Riders is a superb sideways scrolling shoot-em-up for one to four players set in America's Wild West. Four sharpshooter bounty hunters (Steve, Billy, Bob and Cormano) set out to claim the bounties given for killing the most wanted outlaws in the West. The ultimate aim is to survive long enough to reach the final showdown against Sir Richard de la Rose. [CR]Sunset Riders is an incredibly playable game featuring colourful and well-drawn graphics, with a number of humorous visual jokes keeping players entertained. The side-scrolling action takes place both on foot and on horseback, with the action sometimes broken up with a wild west pursuit; such as having to run along the backs of a herd of fleeing Buffalo. [CR]Each level ends with players entering a one-on-one battle against one of the wanted men they have been pursuing. Weapon power-ups can be found and collected to help players in their quest.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Game ID : GX064[CR]Main CPU : Motorola 68000 (@ 16 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 4 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : Yamaha YM2151 (@ 3.579545 Mhz), K053260 (@ 3.579545 Mhz)[CR]Players : 4[CR]Control : 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 2 (ATTACK, JUMP)[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Sunset Riders was released in September 1991. [CR]In the 90s, the official Italian importer for Konami was Elettronica Videogames. Managers of the Japanese company usually visited the foreign partner, bringing a lot of new games and prototypes with them. In one of this circumstances, they brought with them the European prototype of Sunset Riders. In this version, the Mexican character was named 'Hermano' (brother). During a funny moment, trying to say something humorous, the chief technician of the Italian firm proposed: "Why not calling him Cormano?". Cormano, in fact, is the little town near Milan where the importing company was located. [CR]King Records released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Konami Game Music Collection Vol.5 - KICA-7605) on September 26, 1992.[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]The US versions have the "Winners Don't Use Drugs" screen.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]When you're facing off against the first boss, Simon Greedwell, there's a way to fire at him without being hit by his own gunfire. First, all enemies popping out of the house windows need to be cleared away, and the barrel on the left side needs to knocked down, exposing one side of the boss (but make sure you aren't hit and killed by the falling barrel). Then, position your player underneath that side so that he's firing upwards with the left hand at the left side of the boss (this is easier to do if you're holding two guns). If you do this correctly, you'll be able to gun down the boss while his own ammo passes by you harmlessly without touching you.[CR]On the 2nd stage, as you're heading towards the train station where the second boss is waiting, there's an enemy-manned wagon that appears where the occupants throw out at least two logs that you need to jump over, lest you be killed by them. If you can anticipate the appearance of this wagon, you can shoot at the wheel almost instantly upon its arrival to destroy the wagon before they even throw out a single log at you.[CR]On the 4th stage where you face off against the Smith Brothers in the saloon, they throw heavy explosives in your direction, so you need to keep jumping on and off the chandelier and in other directions to avoid their weapons. (Freeing the bar girls will render you intangible for a few seconds.) Don't try to jump onto the platforms where the Smith Brothers are standing while they're still alive, as you can be killed instantly when touching them.[CR]On the 5th stage, the boss, El Greco, carries a whip causing instant death, and a shield. To succeed in hitting him, you need to try and jump around to shoot him from behind, as well as shooting him whenever he jumps, and to do your best to avoid being hit by the whip.[CR]On the final stage, when penetrating Richard Rose's fortress, you need to use the Gatling guns provided to blast your way through two large wooden gates. Just jump onto the stands where your player will automatically grab the gun, point the joystick in the right direction and fire. But be careful, as the Gatling gun's ammo can kill other players as well as the enemy themselves[CR][B]Staff[/B][CR]Director : Hideyuki Tsujimoto (H. Tsujimoto)[CR]Art director : R.

		<plot>The Simpsons (c) 1991 Konami.[CR]A jewel heist gone wrong sees Mr Burns's sidekick, Smithers, kidnapping Maggie and making his escape. Between one and four players take on the role of either Homer, Marge, Lisa, or Bart in this colorful, horizontally-scrolling beat-em-up from Konami. Each Simpsons character possesses an attacking move specific to them; Marge is armed with a vacuum cleaner, Lisa has a skipping rope, Bart has his skateboard, and Homer fights with his fists. The players must battle their way through a variety of Simpsons-themed levels - such as Springfield and Krustyland - fighting goons, thugs, zombies, drunks, firemen, and several Simpsons regulars. Many Simpsons characters that don't appear as enemies have 'cameo' scenes in the game (Otto working at a burgerstand in Krustyland, for example). The archetypal 'boss' character awaits the players at the end of every stage. The game ends with a final showdown with the evil Mr. Burns in his luxurious mansion.[CR]The Simpsons was designed to Konami's typically-high production standards and was, like the 'Ninja Turtles' games that appeared a couple of years' earlier, very faithful to its source material. The colorful, smoothly-animated sprites captured the spirit of the legendary cartoon superbly, and the game's many humorous touches were timed to perfection.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]There were several distinct versions of this game available in the arcade, the 4-player dedicated cabinet, the 4-player conversion kit (designed to retrofit "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles", but a lot of them ended up on "Gauntlet" machines too), and the 2-player conversion kit (designed to retrofit almost anything). The only real difference in game-play between versions was the maximum amount of players. The Simpsons dedicated cabinet was fairly large and had an over-sized control panel (to accommodate 4 players). The sides were decorated with painted side-art showing all five members of the Simpsons family scampering around (Homer seems to be stepping on the tail of the family cat). Some cabinets may have this same scene as a large sticker, instead of it being painted on. American machines are usually blue in color, while the European ones were usually white. The marquee shows a family photo and has a 'The Simpsons' logo done in yellow. The control panel repeats the graphics from the marquee and has 4 joysticks (one for each player), each of which is a different color. Different Simpsons machines will have different sized monitors, although 25" and 32" were the most popular sizes available.

[CR]This video game is based on the prime-time animated series of the same name created by Matt Groening. [CR]The Simpsons and "Aliens" arcade machines can be seen in the background of the 'Moe's Tavern Stage'. Ever wonder why the Aliens arcade game makes a cameo appearance in The Simpsons? It turns out that both The Simpsons tv show and Aliens (the movie) are made by 20th Century Fox (and of course, Konami got the rights to make the arcade games for both franchises). [CR]Some stuff related to the TV series : [CR]* In the character profiles, Lisa is said to be age 7. In the TV series, she is 8 years old. [CR]* In the Character profile, Homer's age is 35. His real age is 36. Konami goofed that one. [CR]* Bart wears a blue shirt in this game. In the series, he normally wears an orange shirt. The blue-shirted Bart appeared on various T-shirts and other Simpsons merchandise. This was even referenced in one episode of the series. Homer was waving Lisa (who wears a red dress) around to attract a bull's attention. Then Homer says 'Now for some calming blue', and reaches for Bart. Seeing that Bart is wearing an orange shirt, he says 'Where's your blue shirt?'. Bart replies, 'I don't have a blue shirt'. [CR]* In some parts of the game, the bow in Maggie's hair is pink. Other times, it is the correct blue color. [CR]* The rabbit characters that appear in various places in the game are from Matt Groening's comic strip, 'Life in Hell'. [CR]* Smithers is much more evil in this game than he has ever been in the show. In the series, Smithers is (as Burns himself put it) 'the sober Yin to [Burns'] raging Yang'. In this game he is depicted as a cape-wearing, bomb-throwing psycho. Smithers' voice is wrong - Smithers is colored wrong. The color scheme used in this game appears to be based on the episode 'Homer's Oddysey', in which Smithers was colored incorrectly. In this episode, his skin color was also incorrect : instead being yellow, it was a dark pink color. Also, Smithers has never worn a cape, as he does in this game (Perhaps he has an evil twin who is a cape-wearing mad bomber!). [CR]* Mr. Burns' voice also sounds wrong, except when he says 'Excellent'. The 'Excellent' voice sample was taken directly from the show and the rest of the lines were recorded by a different actor. [CR]* SPOILER ALERT! : After Mr. Burns has been defeated, his eyes turn into Xs as he is lying on the ground. In the series Bart's eyes were drawn as Xs in a dream sequence, when Bart was imagining that school bully Nelson Muntz had beaten him to death and the school nurse had reconstructed his face for his funeral. [CR]* In this game Sideshow Bob helps you by giving you food that restores your health. Since a first season episode where he framed Krusty the Klown for armed robbery and his plans were foiled by the Simpson kids, he is normally a villain. It seems that this game was made before the first season was finished (Or at least the people who worked on the game hadn't seen all of the episodes yet). [CR]* The 'Moe's Tavern' stage in this game does not look much like it's TV counterpart. In this game it seems to be underground and only accessible by hidden elevators (One of the elevators is in a fake 'Krusty' grave in the cemetary stage, the other in a wall of rock in the 'Springfield Butte' stage). Of course, in the series it is just a regular building with a regular door that people walk through off the street. [CR]* In this game, Barney's hair color is the same color as his skin (yellow). He appeared this way in a few early episodes of the first season, but later his hair was colored brown and only the Simpson kids have hair that is the same color as their skin. [CR]* Channel 6 (Stage 7) : The anchorman in this stage is the same one that appears in the episode 'Call of the Simpsons'. In that episode, this anchorman sounds just like Kent Brockman, but looks completely different. The anchorman's hair was colored gray in the episode, but in this game the anchorman is colored like Scott Christian (Early on in the series, an anchor named Scott Christian would frequently be 'filling in for Kent Brockman', the regular anchorman. Eventually Christian was dropped from the series and they just used Kent Brockman). This anchorman is neither Kent Brockman or Scott Christian. If you stand in front of the anchorman, he will get mad. If you jump up on the anchor's desk, he will shrug his shoulders. [CR]In Stage 7, in the scene where you fight ninjas, the sign reads 'kabuki'. [CR]Michael Jackson used to own this game (4-Player model, serial number: 072251). It was sold at the official Michael Jackson Auction on April 24, 2009.[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]* In the Japanese version, there are nuclear bombs laying around that can be thrown at enemies (for example, in front of the Noiseland Arcade in the first level). These bombs are not present in the other versions. These bombs look the same as the ones Mr. Burns shoots at you on the last level.[CR]* In the Japanese version, you can fill you life meter past full. For example, if your life meter is already full and you get an item that restores your health, you get no benefit in the non-Japanese versions. But in the Japanese version, you will get additional health points, indicated in the meter by a different color (When the life meter is full, it is purple. When it goes past full, the additional health is shown in yellow).[CR][B]Staff[/B][CR]Main programmer : A.

		<plot>Michael Jackson's MoonWalker (c) 1990 Sega.[CR]Based on the movie of the same name, Moonwalker is a scrolling, isometric beat' em up in which Michael Jackson (1958-2009), along with his chimp Bubbles, attempts to save children and defeat the evil 'Mr. Big'. During each round, the player must defeat each and every one of Mr. Big's henchmen and the deadly enemy machines that patrol the levels. This is achieved either by shooting them with Michael Jackson's 'magical energy', or by using his Dance Magic - the game's equivalent of a smart bomb. Some enemies take only one shot to defeat whereas others take several shots before they are destroyed. The longer the player holds down on the fire button, the greater the amount of magical energy Michael can inflict. At the start of each round, the player is given 2 dance magic smart bombs. Towards the end of each round, Michael's pet chimpanzee, Bubbles, will be seen moving about. If Michael touches Bubbles, he will turn into a powerful robot (the 'Moonwalker' of the game's title). After Michael has become Moonwalker, he will be able to shoot lasers and fire missiles. Michael must defeat every boss enemy at the end of each round in order to proceed to the next.[CR]Each player's Michael Jackson character looks identical but wears a different colour : white (left player), red (middle player), and black (right player).[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Game ID : 317-0157 / 317-0158 / 317-0159[CR]Runs on the Sega "System 18" hardware.[CR]Players: 3[CR]Control: 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons: 3[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Released in July 1990.[CR]Moonwalker is made up of 5 stages, each featuring a different Michael Jackson track for the instrumental background music.

Evil Fortress : a reprise of 'Bad'[CR]If you complete all 5 stages and finish the game, the song that will play for the ending will be 'Billie Jean'.[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]FD1094 317-0157[CR]* Japanese version.[CR]FD1094 317-0158[CR]* US version.[CR]* Additional "Winners Don't Use Drugs" screen.[CR]FD1094 317-0159[CR]* World version.[CR]BOOTLEG[CR]* no I8751 @ 8 Mhz :-)[CR][B]Staff[/B][CR]Game concept &amp; Design by : Michael Jackson[CR][B]Game Ports[/B][CR]A version of Moonwalker was released for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis and Sega Master System. It retained most of the gameplay elements of the arcade game that inspired it, but the isometric viewpoint was dropped in favor of sideways scrolling. The end result had more in common with Namco's "Rolling Thunder" than with the arcade MoonWalker.[CR]Versions of the game with completely different gameplay to both the arcade and console versions were released for the popular 8-bit and 16-bit home computers of the time : Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, Commodore 64, Commodore Amiga, MS-DOS, MSX and ZX Spectrum.[CR]</plot>

The heroes must fight their way through four levels of Dr. Doom's villains; including Venom, The Scorpion, The Lizard, The Green Goblin, The Sandman, The Kingpin, The Hobgoblin, Electro, Dr. Octopus and, of course, Dr. Doom himself.[CR]Each player character has a different weapon or power that can be used throughout the game while fighting. Spider-Man uses his webs, The Black Cat uses her 'cat's claw' grappling hook and cable, Hawkeye uses his bow and arrows and The Sub-Mariner uses his hydro-electric charges. The game's viewpoint pans in and out between alternate large and small scale (4-way scrolling) sections.

		<plot>Ninja Baseball BatMan (c) 1993 Irem America Corp.[CR]An abstract and colorful scrolling beat-em-up, in which one to four players control a team of robotic ninjas who must fight their way through a variety of levels, defeating the game's many enemies. The enemies themselves are based entirely around the sport of Baseball; taking the form of Baseballs, Catcher's mitts, bats etc.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Irem M-92 system hardware[CR]Main CPU : V33 (@ 9 Mhz), V30 (@ 7.15909 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : Yamaha YM2151 (@ 3.579545 Mhz), GA20 (@ 3.579545 Mhz)[CR]Players : 4[CR]Control : 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 2[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Released in September 1993. Only 43 units were sold in the USA.[CR]This game is known in Japan as "Yakyuu Kakutou League-Man".[CR]Irem America opened its U.S. office in 1988 in Redmond, Washington, headed up by Frank Ballouz (founder of FABTEK, a thriving video kit company and former North American publisher of several arcades by Seibu Kaihatsu and TAD Corp.) and National Sales Manager Drew Maniscalco. During this time, Drew created the Ninja Baseball Bat Man video game concept (including the English title, plot and characters) and licensed it to Irem America in 1991. To illustrate the characters' sketches, Drew hired Gottlieb's well-known pinball artist, Gordon Morison.[CR]Drew's concept came up after he read the top grossing films during its time in a USA Today newspaper. One was Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, the other was one of the Batman films (possibly Batman Returns). After that, he started creating his own superhero influenced by what he saw in the USA Today newspaper. During the development of his concept, he liked the word NINJA, because of it sounding mysterious to him. He gave the protagonists baseball bats and baseballs as their main weapons, as well as dressing them in baseball uniforms, because both the sport baseball was quite popular nationally in Japan, and Drew is also a baseball fan. Drew thought the baseball bat idea was also probably an influence from the 1973 film Walking Tall. The word MAN in the title comes from Joe Don Baker who starred in the film, while he was a man. He later created the concept for the other characters such as enemies. To illustrate the characters' sketches, Drew hired Gottlieb's well-known pinball artist, Gordon Morison.[CR]Drew's original gameplay ideas for the video game was for a 1-player, adventure-based, platform game similar to Nintendo's "Super Mario Bros.". However, due to the very successful game sales of several 4-player games (most of them being beat 'em ups), Drew added 3-players in an effort to compete with the 4-player games. While the title and characters were Drew's concept, Irem Japan programmed the arcade game, and modified the look of its prototype. Drew did not mind it being different, as he was thrilled about it being programmed by them.[CR]During the development of the 2-player platform version, the two main characters were named Willie and Mickey, named after Drew's two favorite baseball players of his childhood, Willie Mays and Mickey Mantle.[CR]During the development of the 4-player beat 'em up version, the prototype names of the four main characters were Captain Jeff (red), Nunchaks Sugar (green), Hammer' Eddy (yellow) and Naginata Jimmy (blue). Drew later came up with the final names of the four protagonists that are currently used in the finished version today, which the names are references to the four baseball stars during the arcade game's release: Jose Canseco (red), Ryne Sandberg (green), Roger Clemens (yellow) and Darryl Strawberry (blue). In Japan, they were named after their colors.[CR]A year after its concept was created and a year before it was released, despite it being interesting in his opinion, Drew left the company in 1992 and moved to Data East USA. Because of that, he was unable to market nor manage any other input related to the game.[CR]An advert for "Mahou Keibitai Ganhooki", another Irem game, appears on the Ninja Baseball's first stage.[CR]Internet video game critic James Rolfe released an Angry Video Game Nerd special about Ninja Baseball BatMan in 2011.[CR][B]Staff[/B][CR]Planner: Chinta[CR]Graphic designers: Kon.

		<plot>Shinobi (c) 1987 Sega Enterprises, Limited.[CR]Shinobi is a scrolling platform beat-em-up in which the player takes on the role of Joe Musashi, a Shinobi Ninja, who must fight his way through 5 tough missions - each made up of between 3 to 5 stages - in his quest to rescue the kidnapped Ninja children of the Iga clan; now hostages of an evil Ninja syndicate called "Zeed". To complete a mission, the player must rescue all of the kidnapped children on each level, with the number of hostages remaining displayed on a meter in the bottom left corner of the screen.[CR]The Shinobi Ninja begins each level armed with either 'shuriken' throwing stars or a gun for long-range attacks; and a Samurai sword for close-range combat. In addition, the Ninja also has one 'Magic Attack' per level; a smart bomb which kills or damages all on-screen enemies. A points bonus is awarded whenever a level is completed without the Magic Attack being used. An end-of-level guardian awaits the player at the end of each mission, and each takes several hits before it is killed. Once a boss is defeated, the player is taken to a bonus stage in which a large number of Ninjas will try to 'jump' from the back of the screen to the front to attack the player. A bonus life is awarded if the player manages to kill all of the Ninjas without being attacked.[CR]Shinobi was a huge success for Sega, and deservedly so. Its perfectly realized blend of platform and fighting action and is as fine an exponent of the 'easy to get into, difficult to master' gameplay ethic as video games have seen.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the Sega "System 16B" hardware.[CR]Game ID : 317-0049[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-Way Joystick[CR]Buttons : 3 [CR]=&gt; Attack, Jump, Magic[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Shinobi was released in November 1987 in Japan.[CR]Re-Editions:[CR]"Shinobi [Model 317-0050]" (16A)[CR]"Shinobi [Model 317-0054]"[CR]Shinobi was one of the many names given to the ninja in feudal Japan. Its literal translation is 'stealer-in'; a reference to what Ninjas specialized in above all else. By employing any number of tricks such as stealth walking and staying upwind of any guard animals, the Shinobi went undetected about his mission. On a more devious level, the Shinobi was also a master of disguise, and would often 'steal in' to village communities disguised as a local, or into enemy palaces disguised as a wandering priest.[CR]Marilyn Monroe's face appears on several posters in the Mission 1 second stage.[CR]A Shinobi cabinet can be seen in the Nickelodeon show All That (from 1997 to 2000). however it used a fictional marquee which was made for the show.[CR][B]Scoring[/B][CR]Scoring in this game is very easy. Each enemy is worth 100 points with the exception of the Purple Guard and the Sword Throwing Guard which are worth 500 points. The bosses are 5,000 points apiece. NOTE : The Purple Guards and Sword Throwing Guards are the ones that guard the hostages.[CR]In addition to getting points from killing enemies, you can also score points for time left on the clock after you complete a level. You get 30 points per second of remaining time.[CR]You can also receive special bonuses at the end of each level for certain actions :[CR]1) If you don't use your ninja magic, you get a 5,000 point bonus.[CR]2) If you only use your Ninja-to sword (no Shurikens or gunfire), you get a 20,000 point bonus.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Unless you are continuing, each game begins at 'Mission 1' and will have everything you need to complete each mission. Each level must be completed within 3 minutes, and all hostages must be rescued before you can exit the level. If you are killed, all hostages rescued prior to your death will still be recorded as rescued. In addition to melee attacks, you will also be able to use a specific Ninja Magic attack once per level. These magical attacks kill everything that is on the screen but you will be awarded a point bonus if you manage to complete a level WITHOUT using your Ninja Magic. The three Ninja Magic attacks are :[CR]1) Multiple-Attack Magic : Allows you to gain lightning-fast speed to attack up to 12 times at once.[CR]2) Tornado Magic : Brings about a magical tornado to blow your enemies away.[CR]3) Lightning Magic : Causes the air to crackle with electricity and destroys your enemies.[CR]* Some general gameplay guidelines :[CR]1) Joe is strictly a one-hit, one-kill character, so you must avoid all enemy attacks or risk losing a life.[CR]2) As you become more practiced at moving around, you won't have to rely on your distance weapons (throwing stars etc.) and can use your ninja sword for close-up kills; the advantage of this is that you can gain the 20,000 point bonus. This also applies to the use of Ninja Magic.[CR]3) Many of the enemies in the later missions will swarm Joe and attack in numbers, it's vitally important to learn to attack-and-jump as quickly as possible otherwise you will be quickly overrun.[CR]4) Your main goal is, of course, to rescue all the hostages to exit the level; and although three minute time limit initially seems quite generous, should you delay too long with the enemies, the time will quickly run out.[CR]5) It's important to become good at the Challenge Levels, since this is the only way to gain extra lives. The Challenge levels will require you to take out around thirty ninjas who are trying to get to your position. There is no real hard and fast strategy other then take them down before they reach the second platform. Challenge Levels occur at the end of every mission.[CR]6) Ninja Magic is a great thing. You must remember, though, that you can only use it once per level. This means you should only use it when you are totally surrounded by enemies and have no other means of escape.[CR]7) All bosses take eight hits to defeat. Of course, you will have to hit them in the right place for that hit to register.[CR]* Stop Gunners : In levels with Bazooka-toting enemies (Rounds 3-2), push one of them against a wall about ten times (always pushing on his direction, never stopping), you'll see then that all Bazooka men and Gun men are no longer able to use their weapons against you.[CR]* Extra lives from hostages : In game are special hostage, you can get 1UP instead points from them. These hostages are : 2nd hostage on stage 2-2, 1st hostage on 2-3, 2nd hostage on 3-1, 5th hostage on 3-2. What you must do to get 1UP instead points? When you get hostage you must have 3 identical digits at end of your score (don't count last digit which is always 0). Example : 70,000, 100,000, 109,990, 68,880, 141110. 1UP icon will appear instead points icon over hostage.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1. Shinobi [Model 317-0049] (1987, Arcade)[CR]2.

		<plot>Golden Axe (c) 1989 Sega.[CR]Golden Axe is a sideways scrolling beat-em-up set in a traditional fantasy world, in which up to three warriors take up arms to rescue the kidnapped King and his Queen from the evil Death Adder.[CR]The game's three different playable characters are an Amazonian warrior named Tyris Flare, a Barbarian hero named Ax Battler, and a Viking dwarf named Gilius Thunderhead. Each character has a special attack move that is activated by pressing both JUMP and ATTACK at the same time. Also, double-tapping the joystick right or left will make the character charge and smash into opponents.[CR]At certain points during the game, players will come across enemies riding creatures (such as dragons). If the player knocks the original rider from the saddle, the created can be mounted and used against the enemy.[CR]At certain points during a level, as well as on the between-stage intermittent levels, Thieves appear carrying a sack on their back. Players can hit the Thieves causing them to drop food and magic potions - the latter of which are used to create a special magical attack that damages or kills all on-screen enemies.[CR]Each of the game's heroes uses a different kind of magic: Ax Battler uses Earth magic, Tyris uses fire magic and Gilius uses lightning magic. In addition: each player character also carries a different weapon: Tyris and Ax Battler both use swords while Gilius wields an axe.[CR]Golden Axe consists of 9 levels, although only 5 of these are true levels as every 2nd stage is a short intermittent level featuring only the sack-carrying Goblins.[CR]Once Golden Axe has been beaten, an end sequence is a scene of a video arcade, in which the game's characters jump out of the arcade cabinet and chase the game's players out of the arcade and down the street.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the Sega "System 16B" hardware.[CR]Game ID : 317-0110[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 3[CR]=&gt; [A] JUMP, [B] ATTACK, [C] MAGIC[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Golden Axe was released in June 1989.[CR]Re-Editions:[CR]"Golden Axe [Model 317-0120]"[CR]"Golden Axe [Model 317-0121]"[CR]Export releases:[CR][US] "Golden Axe [Model 317-0112]"[CR][US] "Golden Axe [Model 317-0122]"[CR][US] "Golden Axe [Model 317-0123]"[CR]Uchida originally wanted to make a theme similar to "Dragon Quest", but seeing as how the higher ups at Sega didn't quite see the charm in that, Uchida and his team ended up making Golden Axe, thinking that selectable characters and flashy magic spells would make for a success. The game did end up becoming one of Sega's big franchises early on and spawned multiple sequels.[CR]Note : The kanji on the title screen actually reads 'Senpu', meaning 'Fighting Axe'. This is an example of 'gikun', where Japanese artists use the phonetic value of a character to determine the game's name and not the meaning of the character itself.[CR]Many of the samples used for Golden Axe and its sequel were taken from the movies 'Rambo - First Blood' and 'Conan the Cimmerian'. More specific when you kill bad guys sometimes they scream something like 'Oooh God!' which was taken from Rambo at the scene which takes place in the forest when one of the policemen fell into a trap and gets impaled by sharp pieces of wood. The sample used for the man who gets trampled by a bad guy in Golden Axe and the scream of Death-Adder when falling from the dragon at the final scene of "Golden Axe - Revenge of Death-Adder" was taken from the policeman who also fell from the helicopter pursuing Rambo. Finally the battle cry used for the big baddies when they die in Golden Axe and the scream for the big chained green monster on "Golden Axe - Revenge of Death-Adder" on stage 3 are the same and taken from Conan's scene where Arnold Schwarzenegger fights the two villains on a Stonehenge like background and again one of them gets impaled by a trap.[CR]Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Super Sonic Team : G.S.M. SEGA 3 - PCCB-00009) on October 21, 1989.[CR]Wave Master released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Golden Axe The Music - WM-0595~7) on February 21, 2008 containing music from the original arcade and Sega Mega Drive/Genesis series.[CR]Two limited Edition Comic Book Series' to accompany the game were published in the UK in the early 1990's. They can be found along with other Sega-related adaptions in Fleetway's 'Sonic The Comic' which ran for approximately 200 issues.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Two Player Health Restoration : If a player's health is at zero (no life bar visible) when the bonus level/intermission ends, s/he will begin the next level at full health (three life bars). So if you CAREFULLY hack one another, you can restore your health. You should allow the other character to recover after each swipe, otherwise you may throw or kick and actually kill the other player.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

		<plot>Rolling Thunder (c) 1986 Namco.[CR]Rolling Thunder is a single-player scrolling platform shoot-em-up in which a James Bond-esque secret agent codenamed 'Albatross' has been ordered by the Rolling Thunder anti-espionage unit to stop the criminal organization known as Geldra. Albatross must also rescue captured field agent, Lelia Blitz and overthrow Geldra's leader, Maboo.[CR]Rolling Thunder's gameplay takes place on two levels of platforms, with the player able to jump or drop to platforms as and when required. Albatross begins the game armed with only a standard-issue pistol and a limited amount of ammunition. If the pistol's ammunition runs out, the player can only fire a single slow "chaser" bullet - with only one allowed on-screen at any one time - until more ammo is acquired.[CR]Each level is littered with doors; most of these contain constantly emerging enemies and must be carefully passed; some, however, also provide ammunition and new weapons. Ammo rooms are clearly marked while weapons rooms have re-enforced metal doors. A weapons room gives the player a fully automatic assault rifle that allows for continuous firing by holding down the shoot button. As with the pistol, the assault rifle has a limited amount of ammunition.[CR]The majority of Rolling Thunder's protagonists are hooded soldiers known as "Maskers". Maskers are dressed in various colors, which determines both their strength and attack pattern. Some Maskers do not shoot, but throw grenades instead, while others will shoot their gun while crouching, making their shots much harder to avoid.[CR]Other enemies includes ninjas, mutated bats known as Gelzos, panthers, shrieking yellow creatures known as Blogas and lava men.[CR]Albatross must travel through two different segments or "stories" - each composed of five stages - making for a total of ten stages. The stages in Story 2 are essentially a harder version of their Story 1 counterparts, featuring more traps and different enemy placement. At the end of the final stage, the player must battle the Geldra leader Maboo to rescue Leila and complete the mission.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Namco System 86 hardware[CR]Game ID : RT[CR]Main CPU : (2x) M6809 (@ 1.536 Mhz), Hitachi HD63701 (@ 1.536 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : Yamaha YM2151 (@ 3.57958 Mhz), Namco 8-channel WSG, Namco (@ 6 Mhz)[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 4-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 2[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Rolling Thunder was released in December 1986.[CR]Rolling Thunder was the first Jamma game ever produced.[CR]Licensed to Atari for US distribution (February 1987). 2,406 units were produced in the USA by Atari.[CR]A Rolling Thunder unit appears in the 1996 movie 'High School High'.[CR]Alfa Records released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Namco Game Music Vol.1 - 28XA-170) on July 25, 1987.[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]NEW VERSION :[CR]* New title screen.[CR]* BGM of area 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 10 are changed.[CR]* Different enemy arrangement.[CR]* Addition of a Continue feature.[CR]* Addition of the Extra-life feature.[CR]* 150 time units (180 in the old version).[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* One of rolling thunder's more useful 'hidden features' is that it's actually possible to visit the ammo rooms more than once. Once you have stocked up on bullets from a particular room (for example, a Machine-Gun-Bullets room), go forward past the door approximately the distance of two jumps (ensuring that the door in question is completely off screen), then turn back, visit the room again, and find more ammo. The reason this works is because the game is divided into invisible 'sections' and once you cross a section boundary, the game forgets everything from the previous section.[CR]* A step-by-step guide to one of Rolling Thunder's more impressive glitches :[CR]1) In levels five and ten, once you get to a certain point in the level (around halfway through), you come up against two boxes stacked on top of each other (i.e. you can't jump over it), and a platform above you (on which you jump and continue to the RIGHT).[CR]2) At this point, jump UP onto the platform, then position yourself at the very RIGHT EDGE of the railing on the platform (you can only jump up/down where railing is present) which should correspond to the very LEFT EDGE of the BOXES; then jump DOWN. This will put you at the very LEFT EDGE of the boxes.[CR]3) Next, making sure not to move the joystick to the left, walk towards the RIGHT, hit the JUMP button, and you should find yourself 'caught' between the bottom and top boxes. Then jump RIGHT again, clearing the top box and landing on the ground. Don't fire at anyone, and don't panic, but simply go to the RIGHT watch yourself walk through everybody completely unharmed. You can simply walk past everyone until you reach the final, cloak-wearing enemy. Finally, providing you have properly stocked up on 'MG bullets' earlier in the game, simply hold down the fire button and kill the enemy. One final thing to note is that when using this method on level TEN, in that last area before the final arena, there are the 'stairs-like' hurdles, and on each of these steps, a white enemy will appear.[CR]4) You have to be careful not to be in too much of a hurry, or they will follow you into the arena, where they can and will hurt you, or keep you busy enough that the guy in the cloak will. So make sure you have a little extra time to let those guys disappear off the screen (after you've made all of them appear) before going after the guy in the cloak in the arena.[CR]* This is completely useless, but fun to do : at the end of each level there is this force field, which drags you through the door. Just before you get sucked in, turn your back to the exit and make low jumps (jump button only) while pushing the joystick towards the exit. This results in your agent jumping backwards a little every time. When the force field catches you, your character will appear to 'moonwalk' into the exit.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

		<plot>Mortal Kombat (c) 1992 Midway.[CR]Mortal Kombat, first in the Mortal Kombat series, is a 1-on-1 fighting game featuring a cast of seven different characters. Mortal Kombat took ideas from Capcom's seminal Street Fighter II, such as the game's special moves and projectiles. It also introduced a cast of photo-realistic digitized fighters for players to fight either as or against. [CR]Mortal Kombat characters list:[CR]JOHNNY CAGE[CR]KANO[CR]RAIDEN[CR]LIU KANG[CR]SCORPION[CR]SUB-ZERO[CR]SONYA BLADE[CR]Battles are fought over the best of three rounds. At the end of a battle, a voice instructs the winner to 'Finish Him/Her!' and players have only a couple of seconds to try and execute their character's 'fatality', which sees the winner killing the loser in a spectacular and grisly fashion.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Mortal Kombat arcade runs on the Midway Y Unit hardware.[CR]Main CPU: TMS34010[CR]Sound CPU: Motorola M6809[CR]Sound Chips: Yamaha YM2151, DAC, OKI6295[CR]Players: 2[CR]Control: 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons: 5[CR]=&gt; [1] High Punch, [2] Block, [3] High Kick[CR]=&gt; [4] Low Punch, [5] Low Kick[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Mortal Kombat was released in August 1992. It was renowned as the first fighting game to use digitized characters and blood (as opposed to the hand-animated, more cartoon-like graphics of competing games). Mortal Kombat was developed as a reaction to the popular Capcom game "Street Fighter II - The World Warrior", with simpler controls and digitized graphics. Some say the game's graphic violence was gratuitous, and was only included in order to generate a public outcry and controversy that would increase publicity for the game. [CR]Although highly controversial, the mix of realism and violence propelled Mortal Kombat to the height of popularity. An example of the game's innovations was the Fatality, a special finishing move executed against a dying opponent to create an even more gruesome death. For example, one character would grasp a defeated, wobbling opponent by the head, then rip the head and spine out of the opponent's body, which then crumpled to the ground in a pool of blood. Another aspect of gameplay that became a recurring element in games that followed was the so-called 'juggle', where a series of moves could be executed against an opponent who was kept in mid-air by the force of the attacks, and who hence had no defense against further attacks as long as the 'juggle' could be maintained. [CR]The original concept of Mortal Kombat was modeled after the Jean-Claude Van Damme movie 'Bloodsport', which is a cult classic martial arts film. The character of Johnny Cage is directly modeled after Frank Dux, Van Damme's character in the movie. Johnny Cage's film-star motif is an obvious link to this. Cage also wears the same costume (plus shoes) that Van Damme's character wore in the final battle of the movie. Cage's splits punch was originally seen in Bloodsport during the fight against the Sumo wrestler. Since Midway was unable to get Van Damme for this game, they kept the same kumite/martial arts movie concept and added the Kombat story. [CR]Mortal Kombat arcade was the first video game to have an official release date countdown in U.S./U.K. and Australia. This momentous day was known as 'Mortal Monday'. [CR]The code for this game includes the ASCII string 'NOOBSAIBOT' (originally in "Mortal Kombat II" rev. 3.1), suggesting that the character may have made his first appearance here, instead of Reptile (which took up less memory). [CR]The heads used in the background of the Courtyard and Pit stages are actually those of the programmers themselves! The statue of Buddha in the background of the Courtyard stage was actually a lawn ornament from a neighbor's yard. [CR]While fighting on the Pit stage, if you look closely at the glowing moon in the background, you will sometimes see a silhouette fly past it. These shadows will either be Peter Pan and the Darling children, a witch on a broomstick, a kite, a blimp, a rocket, a flying saucer, or Santa Claus in his reindeer-pulled sleigh. The shadows appear about every 6 games. [CR]Liu Kang is Midway's homage to Bruce Lee. [CR]Raiden really is the Japanese God of Thunder. His appearance in myth is quite different though : he has red skin and a demonic face, his feet have two claws on them, and he carries either a wheel or drums on his back. He also is thought to eat human navels so people are advised to lie on their stomachs during storms. [CR]Kano make an appearance on the 2012 animation movie 'Wreck-It Ralph' from Walt Disney Animation Studios.[CR]In the Palace Gates stage, above the red door on the right side, you can see Pac-Man, a ghost and a power pellet carved on the stone. [CR]A hacked version also exists - every stage had a black/night sky and every time you got frozen by Sub-Zero, your fighter would rise up and stay there 'till you either got hit or the freezing effect went away. The same thing would happen if you were using Sub-Zero and froze your opponent. The machine would boot up just like a regular MK machine boots up, except another black screen with red letters and asterisks labeling it as "Mortal Kombat Black Ninja Edition" was displayed before the title screen. [CR]A Mortal Kombat unit appears in the 1995 movie 'The Doom Generation'. [CR]Midway released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Mortal Kombat II: Music from the Arcade Game Soundtrack - 123770-C1) on December 1, 1993. [CR]Michael Jackson used to own this game. It was sold at the official Michael Jackson Auction on April 24, 2009.[CR]The Premium Pack and Kollector's editions of "Mortal Kombat - Deception" for the Sony PlayStation 2 and Microsoft XBOX, respectively, both released on October 4, 2004 in North America, contain a bonus disc containing an arcade-perfect version of the original game.[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]PROTO 4.0 (July 14, 1992): [CR]* Prototype version.[CR]* You cannot play as the same character.[CR]* Menu won't allow cursors to pass each other in 2-player selection.[CR]* Sub-Zero has new corner infinite (ex. uppercut, freeze and repeat)[CR]* Sub-Zero has faster recovery after slide and can go straight into sweep for most instances[CR]* Sub-Zero can freeze opponent in air for 'Finish Him/Her' as he's falling from uppercut, and do fatality in air and body will fall to ground frozen[CR]* Liu Kang can do Flying Kick when you do a HK first in air than F, F HK[CR]* Raiden can now do Torpedo after doing a jumping kick for more combo possibilities [CR]PROTO 8.0 (July 21, 1992): [CR]* Prototype version.[CR]PROTO 9.0 (July 28, 1992): [CR]* Prototype version.[CR]REV. 1.0 (August 9, 1992): [CR]* First official release of Mortal Kombat.[CR]* In a 2-player game, both players could not choose the same character.[CR]* Liu Kang had Uppercut -

The 'papers' that Nicotine throws are called 'o-fuda', which are talismans inscribed with a prayer to endow them with certain powers. Japanese occultism and lore at work.[CR]Neinhalt Sieger's name translates from German as 'non-stop victory'.[CR]Genjuro Kibagami is a huge reference to a Japanese hanafuda deck. Hanafuda is a Japanese card game in which all cards represent a certain flower and time of the year. The hanafuda cards can be seen when Genjuro hits his opponent with special moves. Among the cards seen are wistaria, maple and peony. All cards shown are from an actual hanafuda deck.[CR]Ryuhaku Todo (of AOF) appears in Gen-An's ending.[CR]If you wait a long time, Hikyaku will throw food and/or bombs to the screen. Every so often, Kim Kaphwan (of Fatal Fury) will come out instead.[CR]Kuroko's moves are largely borrowed from other characters.[CR]Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Shin Samurai Spirits - PCCB-00164) on 02/11/1994.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Alternate Costumes Colors : Press D instead of A to choose your character.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

		<plot>Virtua Fighter (c) 1993 Sega.[CR]In this 3-D fighting game, the game's battle system is simple, yet complex. There are 3 buttons : Punch, Kick and Guard. Movement is strictly confined to a horizontal plane.[CR]Battles are won by draining the energy bar of your opponent or by pushing your opponent off the edges of the ring (known as a 'Ring-out').[CR]When a 'Draw' is declared (timer reaches zero with both fighters having an equal amount of energy), a Sudden Death match is held on a very small platform, making a win by Ring-out that much more probable.[CR]The game favours tactical play over mindless button bashing, and the gameplay is balanced accordingly to reflect this.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the Sega "Model 1" hardware.[CR]Control: 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons: 3[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Virtua Fighter was released in December 1993. An instant success in Japanese arcades, Virtua Fighter (or VF for short) brought the versus beat 'em up kicking and screaming into the next generation. Like "Street Fighter II - The World Warrior", a substantial number of clones ("Toshinden", "Tekken", "Dead or Alive") would follow in its wake, each with their own tweaks to the formula.[CR]Among the game's many innovations, the most profound were the true-to-life animation (all the more impressive considering no motion capture technology was used) and the realistic movesets of the game's eight characters.[CR]Virtua Fighter serves 180,000 polygons per second. This is the first 3-D polygonal one-on-one fighting game.[CR]During Virtua Fighter's development, the game featured an Arabian fighter named 'Siba'. He was replaced later on in the final prototypes by Akira, as the developers felt that the game needed a karate fighter similar to Street Fighter's Ryu. Siba was brought back an unlockable character in the Saturn game 'Fighter's Megamix', in all his VF1 style glory.[CR]Soundtrack releases:[CR][JP] March 23, 1994; Virtua Fighter - Saikyou no Senshi [TYCY-5386][CR]Literatures:[CR][JP] June 10, 1994; Gamest No.117: Virtua Fighter[CR][JP] August 24, 1994; Virtua Fighter Maniax [ISBN4-89366-264-3][CR][JP] December 6, 1994; Virtua Fighter Maniax Replays [ISBN4-89366-300-3][CR][JP] January 10, 1995; Virtua Fighter - Ougi no Sho [No. 147][CR][JP] January 30, 1995; Virtua Fighter Maniax for Windows [ISBN4-89366-315-1][CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Play as Dural : First, you must beat the computer Dural and have 2 games worth of credits in the machine ready to go. After beating the game, have one player press Start and pick a character. As soon as that character finishes smiling, but before the game actually starts, player 2 should press Start to interrupt the process. If your timing is perfect, and the stars are perfectly aligned, and you've been a good boy or girl, player 2 may come in as Dural.[CR]* See Credits : You can get the credits of the programmers to come up on the screen by holding down a Start button during the demo. When it comes to the standard  demo w/ Sarah kicking Kage, the credits will come up. Keep holding the Start button to keep the credits coming or else they will freeze.[CR]* Kage's Face Mask : It seems that after about 3,000 plays, the mask on Kage falls off instead of just his headband. You can see his teeth and a scar on his cheek.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1. Virtua Fighter (1993) [CR]2. Virtua Fighter 2 (1994) [CR]3. Virtua Fighter Remix [Model 610-0373-02] (1995) [CR]4.

		<plot>Mortal Kombat II (c) 1993 Midway Mfg. Co.[CR]Mortal Kombat II is a direct sequel to the 1992 original featuring new fighters (increasing the character roster from 7 to 12) and improved graphics. [CR]As with its predecessor, MKII's matches are divided into rounds, with victory awarded to the first player to win two rounds. At the point of defeat, the losing fighter will become dazed and the winner is given the opportunity to execute a 'finishing move'. [CR]Some of the standard fighting moves (moves shared by all characters) have now been expanded or enhanced. A crouching punch has been added and the 'roundhouse kick' is more powerful and now knocks opponents across the screen. Also, the difference in hit boxes between high and low kicks is now more marked. [CR]Additionally, returning characters gain new special moves and MKII marks the first appearence of multiple Fatalities - as well as additional, non-lethal finishing moves - in the series. In addition to the Fatalities of its predecessor, MKII offers 'Babalities' (turning a defeated opponent into a crying baby), 'Friendships' (a non-malicious interaction, such as dancing or giving a gift to the defeated opponent) and stage-specific Fatalities (the winner uppercutting their opponent into an abyss below, spikes above, or a pool of acid in the background). [CR]Each character still shares generic attributes - speed, power, jump height and airtime - albeit with differing hit boxes. The sequel drops the points system of its prequel in favour of a consecutive win tally.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Midway T Unit hardware[CR]Main CPU : TMS34010 (@ 6.25 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU : ADSP2105 (@ 10 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : DMA-driven (@ 10 Mhz)[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 5[CR]=&gt; [1] High Punch, [2] Block, [3] High Kick[CR]=&gt; [4] Low Punch, [5] Low Kick[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Mortal Kombat II was released in April 1993 in USA.[CR]MKII was the first Midway release to use the DCS Sound System. [CR]'Noob Saibot' backwards spells 'Boon' and 'Tobias' who are the names of the principle game designers. [CR]'Jax' was originally supposed to be in the original "Mortal Kombat" game and named Kurtis Stryker. Jax was then moved to MKII and the Stryker character debuted in "Mortal Kombat 3". [CR]'Kintaro' was originally intended to be a humanoid tiger, similar to the creature in Japanese mythology. This idea was scrapped, however, due to the fact that creating the costume would not have been feasable. However, thanks to this original idea, the Shokan we know as Kintaro has the tiger stripes on his back. [CR]Real life : Philip Ahn, who played the regenerated Shang Tsung, is in fact a doctor. [CR]Three of the cast members for MKII filed a lawsuit against Midway shortly after the game was released. The claim? The physical instructors/martial artists Elizabeth Malecki (Sonya Blade), Catalin Zamiar (Kitana/Milenna) and Philip Ahn were under the impression that they were hired under typical acting contracts and were entitled to a small modicum of benefits including royalties of title sales, etc. The plaintiffs banded together against Midway, who took the case to court. Eventually the judge failed on Midway's behalf, citing that the work done by the plaintiffs for Midway was done strictly as a 'work-for-hire' and Midway owned all the property and benefits on the characters/titles/etc. As a consequence, all three left the project, and were recast for "Mortal Kombat 3". [CR]SFII / MK2 : both games were supposed to be released within weeks of each other (at this time, "Street Fighter" and "Mortal Kombat" were the dominant fighting games). Capcom released "Super Street Fighter II - The New Challengers" early so that they could attract fans away from MK. At the same time, Midway released MK2 early for similar reasons. As you can see, the result meant that both came back to square one.[CR]One of Jade's clues references Chun Li from Street Fighter "Chun who?"[CR]'Friendships' and 'Babalities' (see 'Tips And Tricks' section for more info) in MKII were used in making light of the violence controversy in the first "Mortal Kombat" game. [CR]Two non-existent hidden characters were 'Torch', and 'Hornbuckle'. In MKII there is a location called 'The Pit II'. Far in the background of this stage there is another bridge across the chasm. Standing stationary on this bridge are two fighters : one of them is a Liu Kang sprite with green pants who was named Hornbuckle by fans. One of Jade's hints was 'Hornbuckle who?', which people thought was the name of a hidden fighter, and was apparently given to the guy opposite 'Torch' on The Pit II. If you watch the ending credits, one of the programmers' last names is Hornbuckle. The other fighter is a humanoid character that seems to be made of fire. As these two characters never move, it has been suggested that the 'other fighter' is actually a funeral pyre. Finally, there is a cloaked figure who floats in front of the window during fights in The Tower and Portal stages in MKII. This character was dubbed Cloak by fans, and was assumed to be a hidden character. The character of Torch, who had been very popular with fans, eventually showed up as a playable character in "Mortal Kombat : Deadly Alliance". Unfortunately, due to trademark issues, he had to be called Blaze instead of Torch. The true identity of Cloak was revealed in "Mortal Kombat : Shaolin Monks" to be one of Shang Tsung's servants, a shadow priest. [CR]The head that occasionally appears after an uppercut and says 'Toasty' is the digitized head of Dan Forden who worked on the sound and music for the game.[CR]Ed Boon's face was superimposed onto the trees for the Living Forest stage.[CR]Jimmy Cardenas holds the official record for this game with 282,000 points. [CR]Midway released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Mortal Kombat II: Music from the Arcade Game Soundtrack - 123770-C1) on December 1, 1993.[CR]An arcade-perfect emulation of this game is an unlockable feature in "Mortal Kombat - Shaolin Monks" for the Sony PlayStation 2 and Microsoft XBOX.[CR]Popular pirate hacks of MK2 are known as:[CR]"Mortal Kombat II 4.2"[CR]"Mortal Kombat II 9.1"[CR]"Mortal Kombat II Challenger.."[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]REV. 1.1 :[CR]* First version released to the public even though unfinished.[CR]* Free Play on by default.[CR]* Contained almost all moves but not many fatalities (certain characters have none, Babalities/Friendships/Stage Fatalities missing completely).[CR]* Kintaro and Shao Kahn very difficult to beat.[CR]* Shao Kahn, Kano, and Sonya missing from Kahn's Arena stage.[CR]* No ending stories.[CR]* Several sounds missing (Sub-Zero's freeze, Baraka's blade swipe, All of Shao Kahn)[CR]* Kung Lao is extremely buggy, walls can block hat toss.[CR]* Shang Tsung had the ceiling walk bug.[CR]* Could beat Kintaro by just punching the entire match.[CR]* High score missing (Longest Winning Streaks).[CR]* Certain characters use alternate colors by default.[CR]* It says "Battlezone" instead of "Kombat Zone" at the bottom of the 2-player Vs. screen.[CR]* You cannot throw the CPU.[CR]* Fight ladder is static.[CR]* Player 2 always has the 2nd palette.[CR]* P2 Button 6 crashes the game (not used).[CR]* Briefly locks up/No announcement if character(s) remain unchosen.[CR]REV. 1.4 :[CR]* Mileena's ground roll move added.[CR]* Kung Lao's aerial kick added.[CR]* Player 2 now has the 2nd palette only in 'Mirror Matches'.[CR]* Sub-Zero could do the first part of the freeze-uppercut fatality during the match.[CR]* Danger indicator added.[CR]* Longest Winning Streaks added[CR]REV. 2.0 :[CR]???[CR]REV. 2.1 :[CR]* First 'official' release version.[CR]* Intro text slightly changed.[CR]* It now says "Kombat Zone" at the bottom of the 2-player Vs. screen.[CR]* Reptile's slide added.[CR]* Shao Kahn, Kano, and Sonya added to background in Kahn's Arena stage (Shao Kahn is only seated on the throne when he is not fighting).[CR]* Ending story and credits added.[CR]* Computer intelligence improved.[CR]* Nearly all fatalities were added.[CR]* Friendships and babalities were added.[CR]* The Pit II/Kombat Tomb fatality was added.[CR]* Smoke and Jade were added.[CR]* Kintaro and Shao Kahn became easier to defeat.[CR]* Could keep Kintaro and Shao Kahn up in the corner by using repeated punches.[CR]* Could crash the game through baby brutalization.[CR]* Doing Shang Tsung's soul stealing fatality against Jax could sometimes crash the game.[CR]REV. 3.0 :[CR]???[CR]REV. 3.1 :[CR]* More amounts of blood added.[CR]* Dead Pool fatality added.[CR]* Noob Saibot added.[CR]* Raiden's super uppercut fatality added.[CR]* Kung Lao's friendship added.[CR]* Pictures of the creators added after the credits.[CR]* Revolution X and DCS ads added.[CR]* Comic and CD offer shows picture of CD.[CR]* Computer intelligence increased.[CR]* Computer has ability to do missile weapons in the air.[CR]* Multiple babality problem fixed.[CR]* Repeated punches in the corner against Kintaro fixed.[CR]* Kitana's multiple fan lifts in the corner fixed.[CR]* Sub-Zero freeze - punch - freeze - punch... fixed.[CR]REV. 3.2[CR]* European release only ?[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Secret EJB MENU:[CR]Press P1_BLOCK (5 times), P2_BLOCK (10 times), P1_BLOCK (2 times), P2_BLOCK (8 times), P1_BLOCK (2 times)[CR]* Display Top Fifteen Players : press down on any joystick during the attract mode.[CR]* Disable throws in Versus Mode : hold Down+HP on player one and two's controls after both fighters have been selected.

[CR]When they recorded the announcer's voice, she had to say both the original names and the 'Export' ones during the recording. But for some of the characters' names that were NOT changed, there were alternate pronunciations recorded.[CR]For example, when you select Chun-Li in the original Japanese version, the way the announcer pronounces 'Chun' rhymes with 'noon'. [CR]In the Export versions, the way she pronounces 'Chun' rhymes with 'fun'. There is also an unused alternate pronunciation of Zangief (which sounds like 'Zain-geef') that can be heard in the Sound Test. [CR]Megaman's 'Rock Upper' move in the original Japanese version is called 'Mega Upper' in the Export versions, simply because the name of the character is different in Japan and Worldwide.[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]Blue Board revisions : [CR]REVISION 1:[CR]* Build date: 971222[CR]* US release.[CR]REVISION 2:[CR]* Build date: 980112[CR]* EUROPE release.[CR]REVISION 3:[CR]* Build date: 980123[CR]* US &amp; EUROPE releases.[CR][B]Game Ports[/B][CR]* Consoles :[CR]Sega Dreamcast [US] (September 30, 1999) "Marvel vs. Capcom - Clash of Super Heroes [Model T-1202N]" : Re-released as Sega All Stars edition (2000)[CR]Sony PlayStation [US] (January 27, 2000) "Marvel vs. Capcom - Clash of Super Heroes [Model SLUS-01059]" [CR]Sony PlayStation [EU] (January 31, 2000) Marvel vs. Capcom - Clash of Super Heroes [Model SLES-02305]" [CR]Sega Dreamcast [EU] (June 23, 2000) "Marvel vs. Capcom - Clash of Super Heroes [Model T-7002D-61] [CR]Sony PlayStation 3 [PSN] [US] (September 25, 2012) "Marvel vs. Capcom Origins" [CR]Microsoft XBOX 360 [XBLA] [US] [EU] [AU] (September 26, 2012) "Marvel vs. Capcom Origins" [CR]Sony PlayStation 3 [PSN] [EU] (October 10, 2012) "Marvel vs. Capcom Origins"[CR]</plot>

It was known there as the 27th video game released for the CPS2 hardware.[CR]This game is not a actual sequel, but rather a redesigned version, using the newest Darkstalkers engine. It even includes a reworked version of "Vampire Savior 2"'s intro, which removes all references to Jedah, Bulleta, Q-Bee and Lilith.[CR]Capcom cheated with Vampire Hunter 2, since, chronologically, Anita would be in her teens by the time of Vampire Savior, but they removed Donovan from "Vampire Savior"'s storyline, bringing in Bulleta, instead.[CR]Huitzil (Phobos' name outside of Japan) is the diminutive of 'Huitzilopochtli' (which means 'Blue Hummingbird on the Left'). He was the chief god of the great Aztec city Tenochtitlan and became after his death the Aztec god of the Sun and War.[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]Green Board revisions : [CR]REVISION 1:[CR]* Build date: 970913[CR]REVISION 2:[CR]* Build date: 970929[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Hidden Warriors: The first will appear if you make 3 'DARK FORCE' or 3 'EX FINISH' without losing a round.

Progressive damage is shown on each fighter's face for a dramatic effect.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the SNK "Neo-Geo MVS" hardware.[CR]Game ID : NGM-044[CR][SNK MVS Neo-Geo Controls][CR]2 players - 4 buttons per player[CR]= &gt; [A] Punching attack, [B] Kicking attack, [C] Throw enemy, [D] Taunt[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Ryuuko no Ken was released in September 1992 in Japan.[CR]The title of this game translates from Japanese as 'Dragon and Tiger Fist'.[CR]This game is known outside Japan as Art of fighting" [CR]A bootleg of this game is known as "Fit of Fighting".[CR]SNK's second fighting-game franchise. It was the first fighting game by SNK to feature the character designs of former SNK illustrator Shinkiro, who would go on to do the character designs for the later "Fatal Fury" and "The King of Fighters" games.[CR]This is the first fighting game to feature the 'camera zoom' - where the camera zooms in when the fighters are close together and zooms out when the fighters move away from each other. This is also the first fighting game to utilize a 'spirit meter'. Every time a special move is executed the spirit meter is depleted accordingly. The more powerful the special move, the more it depletes. When it's empty special moves can't be done anymore, however, you can recharge the spirit meter by standing still and holding the A or B button leaving you totally defenseless.[CR]Robert Garcia design was inspired by the famous actor Steven Seagal.[CR]Takuma Sakazaki desgin was inspired by Masutatsu Oyama.[CR]The Haou Shokou Ken was referred to as the Haou Ken (or as the game put it, the 'Haow-Ken'). Its similarity to Ryu's (of "Street Fighter" fame) Hadou Ken forced the name change.[CR]The character's fighting stance and their victory pose depends on how beaten up they are.[CR]Lee Pai Long is called Lee Piron in the game's source code.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Play as Todoh, Jack, Lee, King, Micky and John : player 2 must join.[CR]* Play as Mr. Big and Mr. Karate : reach them on 1P Game, then player 2 must join.[CR]* Move Command Delay : its possible to input the commands for any special or super move but it is not necessary to press the corresponding attack button right away, this allows you to delay any move for as long as you want in order to surprise an opponent! This trick also enables you to perform slower versions of some special moves such as projectile attacks. Try it! :)[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1. Ryuuko no Ken [Model NGM-044] (1992)[CR]2.

		<plot>The King of Fighters '98 - The Slugfest (c) 1998 SNK.[CR]A special edition of the KoF series taking place outside of the established storyline with a whopping 38 selectable KoF alumni.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the SNK "Neo-Geo MVS" hardware.[CR]Game ID : NGM-242[CR][SNK MVS Neo-Geo Controls][CR]2 players - 4 buttons per player.[CR][JOYSTICK] 8-way, [A] Weak punch, [B] Weak kick, [C] Strong punch, [D] Strong kick[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Released in July 1998.[CR]This game is known in Japan as "The King of Fighters '98 - Dream Match Never Ends".[CR]It is said that this game is a 'dream match' for more reasons than one - this KOF is said to exist only in Shingo's dream - each character in this dream match was Shingo's impression of these characters, based on either personal experience or his notes in his notebook.[CR]Yuri has a long record of taking movements from other characters, especially Capcom (see previous KOF entries). In this new opus : Yuri's new special attack 'Shin! Chou Upper' is a knock off of Ryu's Shin Shoryuu Ken. She also has a movement similar to Terry's burn knuckle. Finally, her Forward+A is a parody of Sakura's Flower Kick.[CR]KOF98 contains pieces of music from older KOFs.[CR]For example, the character select music when a second player joins in is straight from KOF 96 (it's called Roulette).[CR]Here's a complete list of themes, the teams (or individuals) they belong to and the games they were taken from :[CR]Esaka? (Japan Team) : KOF 96 (Japan Team's theme music).[CR]Esaka (95-style Kyo Kusanagi) : KOF 94 (Japan Team's theme music).[CR]Kurikinton (Fatal Fury Team) : Fatal Fury 2 (Terry Bogard's theme music).[CR]Art of Fight (Art of Fighting Team) : Art of Fighting (Ryo Sakazaki's and Ryuhaku Todo's theme music).[CR]Rumbling in the City (Ikari Team) : KOF 96 (Ikari Team's theme music).[CR]Shin!

('94 Gals Fighters Team) : KOF 94 (Gals Fighters Team's theme music).[CR]Also to note that the music that is played prior to facing Rugal (Kettou R&amp;D) is also from KOF 94 (as the theme for Rugal's first form).[CR]When Choi Bounge appears, a 7 seconds sample from a song is played. This song is 'Choi Bounge Ondo', which appeared in the KOF 97 Arrange SoundTracks. The song became quite popular in Japan.[CR]Mr. Big from "Art of Fighting" makes a small cameo appearance in the USA Wharf background, during the first rounds.[CR]About Kyo Version 95 : Because the introduction of different versions for this character included as "hidden features" in KOF '97 was such a hit with fans, designers thought, another version of Kyo in KOF '98 would make the game more inviting. Designers also remember that both versions for Kyo Kusanagi for game tests were equally popular. This concept for different versions of this character subsequently became the basis for the 'Kyo clones'.[CR]In the Japan Street stage, during the second round if you look in the middle of the background where some shops are, you can see tiny moving people who look like Iori, Mai and Terry Bogard. In the third and fifth round, you can see two people doing hand signals, they look similar to Kyo Kusanagi &amp; Shingo Yabuki. In the fourth round, you can see Mai and Terry.[CR]A serious bug : Using a USA bios rom if you insert a coin on the 'winners don't use drugs' screen on a single slot the games will use the neo+geo bios s1 tile-set rather than the game tiles, this causes most of the graphics to be hidden and the games to be unplayable, it will also end up using the main-board z80 bios so sound will be broken, the games should fix themselves if you let them run another attact loop after game over, on a multi-slot the games will reset. This is one of the first 4 'gigapower' games, the bug was fixed after that.[CR]Leona, Ralph and Clark are playable characters in the Foma 90x Series Mobile Phones game 'Metal Slug Survivors'.[CR]Soundtrack releases:[CR][JP] Aug. 19, 1998; The King of Fighters '98 - Dream Match Never Ends [PCCB-00334] - Pony Canyon.[CR][JP] Sep. 18, 1998; The King of Fighters '98 - Dream Match Never Ends Arrange Sound Trax [PCCB-00337] - Pony Canyon.[CR](JP] Oct. 07, 1998; The King of Fighters '98 - Dream Match Never Ends Drama CD [PCCB-00339] - Pony Canyon.[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]At the Intro music (CIPHER) and the Staff Roll BGM (ZERO) a sample used says 'mot*er fu**er'.

		<plot>Blood Storm (c) 1994 Strata.[CR]Blood Storm is considered by many as a quasi-'sequel' to Time Killers. The game had a rather dark storyline as there were few ambiguously good characters as the other ranged from being sociopathically insane or deceptive folk.[CR]BloodStorm was dubbed as a possible &#8220;MK-killer&#8221; in an attempt to surpass rival Midway's success with Mortal Kombat, though it did not prevail. It was the last game Strata produced before the company went out of business.[CR]As with its predecessor Time Killers, BloodStorm features many of the aspects carried down from it, such as the removal of an opponent&#8217;s arms and an &#8216;instant kill&#8217; attack, as well as a Special Death Move. The button layout is virtually the same. They are labeled as "back leg", "front leg", "back arm" and "front arm" respectively. A button in the center is used to make the character block. As one would suspect, if a particular limb is lost in combat, its corresponding button is rendered useless.[CR]BloodStorm is also a weapons-based fighter, though it differs from Time Killers in that the characters use weapons called "Gauntlets" that also allow them to use particular powers and attacks with them. Other than being able to bash off an opponent&#8217;s arms, a technique called a &#8216;Sunder&#8217; is also in the game. If executed when an opponent is stunned, it will destroy their lower body. The character will not be able to jump or use kicks, but can still move back and forth a little with the leg buttons.[CR]Even after a successful Sunder attack, the fight can still go on, if the character&#8217;s life bar is not totally drained yet. However, if both limbs are lost afterwards (if they weren't already torn off prior to the Sunder attack) then s/he is almost completely helpless. (There are a few special moves that don't require arms or legs, and those can still be performed). Characters are restored back to normal form after a round is over much like Time Killers as well.[CR]A notable feature in the game is that when an opponent is defeated, the player gains a &#8216;passable power&#8217; much like in a style akin to the Mega Man series. These powers or weapons can be used at any time to give the player a further advantage. Also, players can save their progress in a game with a password feature by pressing buttons during the player select screen.

BLOODSTORM VERSION X.XX[CR]* Fight Against Hidden Agents :[CR]1) GOLEM : In Subterra (the background with the cliffs on either side), there is a spike hanging down from the ceiling, suspended over the cliff. If you can knock down the spike, it falls into the pit. Then you just jump into the pit and you will not get spiked, you will stand on top of the fallen spike and enter through the door! To knock down the spike, you need to hit it twice with either your gauntlet or a projectile. Simply jump into the air and do the normal gauntlet throw move or whatever your projectile move is.[CR]2) DIMENTHIA : In the Obsel desert, on the ground, amidst all those symbols, there is a circular figure with five lines in it, like dividing a pie into five even wedges. Once the round begins, throw your gauntlet. You can jump and ditch it away, even. You won't need it. Move to the circular figure and do the move to pick up the gauntlet. The character will bend down and touch the ground. When the character touches the circular figure, a portal is activated and the character is transported to Triax, to fight Dimentia.[CR]3) CRANIAC : You get to him from the Black Armada background (This background is the one with a catwalk in the distance). Getting to the back platform is the key. Hold Block and move Up 2 or 3 times to jump back to the far away platform. Moving left or right makes you switch sides, down keeps you still and up or center makes you come right back to the front. To get to Craniac, jump back to the platform 3 times and hold down each time you get back there, in order to get as much time back there as possible. 5 seconds after returning from the third trip, a small Craniac will fly onto the platform. While he is there, jump back there again to be with him, holding down to wait there. The game will freeze and a message will come up stating that you will fight Craniac![CR]4) WRAITH : he is found from the Scorch HQ background. You get to Wraith by entering a 'trash talk' password after you win a match on this background. The password is UP(x3), Block. If it done correctly, 'WRAITH SUMMONED' appears on the screen.[CR]5) RATCHET : On Nimbus, note the far left side of the platform... there is a line that separates the small edge part from the rest of the platform. This is the key. On the winning round, you must defeat the opponent so that either you or your opponent stays fully to the left of the line, in the edge part. Then, you enter a 'trash-talk' code : Hold Left, then Front Leg(x4), Block.[CR]6) SHADOW : Beat your opponent 2-0 from any background (no round 3 allowed, folks....without using the Block button in any match and do the fatality on BOTH rounds).[CR]7) BLOOD : Blood, like Shadow, can be found from any background. To fight Blood, you need to have a perfect round and then win the match. Note that if you get a Perfect in the first round, Blood will not appear until the match (win 2 out of 3) is over. If you do this, the dead opponent explodes and Blood comes alive![CR]8) SIN : Beat all of the 8 regular fighters.[CR]* SPECIAL Ending : When you have beaten all of the regular fighters and all of the hidden agents, you will get to see the credits and at the end of the credits, a code and a telephone number is given to you :).[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

		<plot>Garou - Mark of the Wolves (c) 1999 SNK.[CR]The 9th 'Fatal Fury' episode brings us 12 characters and foregoes the plane-switching style of its predecessors in favour of standard single-plane battles. One of the last games produced by the original SNK.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the SNK "Neo-Geo MVS" hardware.[CR]Game ID : NGM-253[CR][SNK MVS Neo-Geo Controls][CR]2 players - 4 buttons per player.[CR][JOYSTICK] 8-way [A] Swift punch [B] Swift kick [C] Pummeler punch [D] Colossal kick[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Released in November 1999.[CR]'Garou' translates from Japanese as 'Hungry Wolf'. 'Mark of the Wolves' is a reference to the legacy left behind by Terry to a new generation of fighters - specifically, Rock Howard. This can also refer to the legacy left by other characters from the previous Fatal Fury &amp; Art of Fighting games. Kim Dong Hwan &amp; Kim Jae Hoon are sons of Tae-Kwon Do fighter Kim Kaphwan. Khushmood Butt is a master of Kyokugenryu Karate, the same martial used by Ryo Sakazaki from Art of Fighting. Hokutomaru uses Shiranui-style Ninjitsu as his fighting style, this is the same ninja arts that Mai Shiranui uses, however Hokutomaru was trained by Andy Bogard.[CR]Garou pushes the capabilities of the Neo-Geo MVS hardware to its limit, giving some of the best-looking graphics to date. Some critics saying that there is life after all in the Neo-Geo hardware, which was past its prime when the game was released.[CR]Hokutomaru's stage has quite a few references to the rest of the "Fatal Fury" series. To the extreme left of the stage is a billboard with a picture of the old style Terry Bogard. A portrait of Geese Howard and his lieutenants can be seen on another billboard (this is the same picture that is seen in the flyer for Real Bout Fatal Fury). There is also a picture of Andy Bogard and Mai Shiranui holding hands posing as a bank advertisement right above another picture of Alfred.[CR]The sign that Khushnood Butt shows off in his victory pose is a Kyokugen Karate dojo sign.[CR]The Rock Howard music stage contains a part of Robert Miles' seminal trance tune Children.[CR]Rock Howard is the son of the notorious crime-lord Geese Howard, the boss of previous Fatal Fury games. Rock was trained to fight by Terry Bogard and has incorporated moves from Terry and Geese's styles into his own fighting style. Rock is also related to Garou's main boss of the game: Kain R. Heinlein. Geese Howard married Marie Heinlein, whom is the sister of Kain. So, we can assume that Kain is Rock's uncle.[CR]The word 'Tizoc' (The Griffon Mask's Japanese name) means 'sick leg', or 'lame leg'. It was the name of an ancient Mexican tlatoani, or leader, who ruled from 1481 until 1486, when he was poisoned by Aztec aristocrats.[CR]If a double KO occurs, a round is won by each fighter, which can end a battle on this quite unsatisfying note. Moreover in this case, the player has no fighting level, neither displayed on the screen nor counted for the points.[CR]Soundtracks release:[CR][JP] Jan. 21, 2000; Garou - Mark of the Wolves [SCDC-00006] Scitron[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]The prototype version has a white background at the title screen instead a blue background on the final version. It has also a graphic bug on the Terry Bogard stage during the second round at the extreme right.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Random Fighter : Hold Start and press a Punch or Kick button at the character selection screen.[CR]* Play as Grant : At the character select screen, highlight Dong Hwan, hold Start and press Up(x2) Down(x2), Up, Down.[CR]* Play as Kain R. Heinlein : At the character select screen, highlight Jae Hoon, hold Start and press Down(x2), Up(x2), Down, Up.[CR]* Play against Kain R. Heinlein : To reach Kain, you must finish the first 7 matches with an average fighting level of AAA. Your best bet would be to avoid losing any rounds throughout the preliminary 7 stages, especially Grant. If you meet this condition after defeating Grant, you'll get a cutscene featuring Kain R. Heinlein. Beat Kain to reveal your characters' true ending.[CR]* Alternate Costume Colors : Each character has 4 colors, corresponding to each button.[CR]* Secret Taunts : After defeating your opponent, hold Left or Right and tap Start to use an hidden taunt. Every character has two secret taunts (these can ONLY be used after defeating an opponent and before your character goes into his/her winning pose). Some of them, such as Hotaru's and Hokutomaru's are really cool! :)[CR]Taunts in the game can affect the background stages in many ways. For example, by using a taunt during a fight in Hotaru's stage (Philanthropy Belfry) you can make the bells in the background move. Most stages have hidden animations that can only be seen by this trick so try it! :)[CR]* Survival Mode : Insert a coin, hold A+B+C+D and press Start. You will then play a Survival Mode (quite hard one too).[CR]* Rock's Win-pose : Rock will have a special win-pose when he finishes the opponent with a Shine Knuckle and a different one when he finishes the opponent with either a Raging Storm or the Deadly Rave Neo.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.
