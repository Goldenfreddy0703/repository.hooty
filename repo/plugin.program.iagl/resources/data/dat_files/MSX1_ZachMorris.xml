Filtered to remove duplicates, betas, etc.[CR]MSX1 is the first in 4 generations of computer based systems in the MSX line.[CR]The MSX is a standardized home computer architecture.  Despite Microsoft's involvement, the MSX-based machines were seldom released in the United States, but were popular in Asian countries like Japan and South Korea, South American countries like Brazil and Chile, and in the European market in countries like the Netherlands, France, Spain and Finland. To a lesser extent, the MSX platform was also popular in the former Soviet Union and Kuwait.[CR]Before the appearance and great success of Nintendo's Family Computer, MSX was the platform for which major Japanese game studios, such as Konami and Hudson Soft, produced video game titles. The Metal Gear series, for example, was originally written for MSX hardware.[CR]Developer:  ASCII Corporation[CR]Manufacturer :  Microsoft[CR]CPU:  Zilog Z80A running at 3.58 MHz[CR]Memory: 32 kB ROM / 8 kb RAM[CR]Graphics:  Yamaha V9938 128 KB[CR]Sound:  Yamaha YM2149[CR]Display:  512x212 (16 colors)[CR]Media:  Cartridge and Floppy</emu_comment>

There are jars which may contain both treasures and danger, and which block the way. You have an inventory, but it can only contain one item at any time. Take care in what you pick up and leave behind. Juggling the inventory becomes a basic skill since items will block the narrow passages of the dungeon. Basic items are keys, for opening the door to the next dungeon, as well as cheese, which is good for the adventuring mouse's stamina. The dungeon must be completed within a set time or it's game over.[CR]Control the mouse with the cursor keys, and use the following keys to issue commands:[CR]B: Crush jar[CR]T: Take item[CR]O: Open door[CR]P: Leave item behind[CR]E: Eat cheese[CR]K: Kick frog</plot>

			<plot>Arkanoid is an arcade game developed by Taito in 1986. It expanded upon Atari's Breakout games of the 1970s by adding power-ups, different types of bricks, a variety of level layouts, and visual layering and depth. The title refers to a doomed "mothership" from which the player's ship, the Vaus, escapes.[CR]The player controls the "Vaus", a space vessel that acts as the game's "paddle" which prevents a ball from falling from the playing field, attempting to bounce it against a number of bricks</plot>

The ships can be docked side-by-side or end-to-end for greater fire and fighting power. When docked one player is the pilot and the other is the weapons officer. But this game can also be played by a single player. When you progress in the game you can select more advance weapons systems to fight the over 50 different enemy characters. Compared with its predecessor there is not much changed only better graphics, more detailed backgrounds and inter level animations.</plot>

Energy is lost when the player collides with a monster or gets pushed by a block. The game is based on the two BBC Micro titles Pingu and Rubble Trouble and uses 16 types of blocks; those from the games it is based on along with blocks that can go around corners. There are six different monsters and the game's 400 rooms are not random, but designed individually. Energy can also be gained back, along with bonus points.</plot>

			<plot>In Banana, you are a round little thing on the Amazonas river, hunted by the man-eating Boconda tribe. A bit like Q*Bert, you jump around on stones in the river. Jumping is done by placing a cursor, with limited range, above a stone. If you don't place it right above the stone, you instead jump into the water. This isn't necessarily lethal, since you can jump up on adjacent stones, or you can go with the flow, as long as you take care not to pulled by the strong current into a spot where there are no stones to seek refuge on. It is also in the water that you will catch bananas coming down the stream.Bananas are necessary to get rid of the Bocondas; they can be placed on top of stones, and if a Boconda tries to jump at you, they will land on a banana and slip into the river where they are swept away. They are smart, though, so you will need to trick them into jumping onto your boobytrapped stones. Instead of tricking them, you can also swim to the river shore, pick up stones on the shore and throw them at the Bocondas to make them fall off their stones.</plot>

			<title_clean>Bank Panic</title_clean>
			<plot>Bandits are holding up a bank and have taken people hostage, and as a gunslinger, it's your job to shoot them. The bank has 12 doors, and the bandits are behind each one of them. When they pull a gun out at you when you open a door, you have only a few seconds to shoot them before they shoot you. If you shoot them too early (ie: before he sticks his gun out at you), it is considered unfair, and you won't score any points, but if you're too late, he'll shoot you and you lose one of your three lives. If you waste too much time, a bandit will come out from one of the doors and stick dynamite on it. You must then shoot the dynamite to get rid of it. If you're lucky, either a man or a woman will throw you a bag of gold coins. If you shoot any of these people by accident, you also lose a life. More often than not, the person will throw his/her hands up, saying "I haven't got anything". That's when they will be replaced by bandits. Some men will carry three to five pieces of gold on top of their heads, and shooting at all of the gold will award you with a bag of gold coins. Others will be tied up with rope. If you shoot the rope, there's more money for you, because not only will you receive one bag of gold coins, but you'll get three bags of gold coins.There are more than ten rounds in Bank Panic, and each one ends when a person behind all 12 doors was able to throw you a bag of gold coins. The rounds get difficult the further you get. For example, in later rounds, a few bandits will block your shot, and you have to then shoot twice. Also, regardless of what round you're on, you can shoot so many bandits before time runs out.</plot>

			<plot>Batman is a 1986 3D isometric action-adventure game by Ocean Software for the Amstrad PCW, Amstrad CPC, ZX Spectrum and MSX, MSX-2 microcomputers, and the first Batman game ever developed. Upon release, the game received favorable reviews, and received a sequel two years later, titled Batman: The Caped Crusader.[CR]The object of the game is to rescue Robin by collecting the seven parts of the Batcraft hovercraft that are scattered around the Batcave. The gameplay takes place in a 3D isometric universe, which programmer John Ritman and artist Bernie Drummond would further develop for 1987's Head over Heels, and is notable for implementing an early example of a system that allows players to restart from an intermediate point in the game on the loss of all lives rather than returning all the way to the start (in this case the point at which Batman collects a "Batstone").</plot>

			<plot>In this game, players control Rodger the Dodger (aka: Blagger), a burglar whose task is to collect a series of keys in a certain location, then use them to open the safe. Blagger must perform these tasks under a time limit while avoiding hazards such as cacti, cars, aliens, mad hatters, giant mouths, and chinamen. Blagger has no weapon to shoot these, but must rely on his jumping skills. He loses a life if he comes into contact with a hazard or falls long distances, or if he runs out of time. As usual, the game ends when all lives are lost. If Blagger successfully grabs the keys and makes his way to the safe, he proceeds to the next location.</plot>

			<plot>Rumor says that the legendary Black Onyx, an artifact that grants eternal youth and happiness to those who can find it, lies within the Black Tower near the town of Utsuro. You assemble a party of brave adventurers and venture into the tower, defeating monsters on your way to the great treasure.The Black Onyx is one of the first traditional role-playing games made by a Japanese company. It is similar in gameplay to early Wizardry and Ultima games with killing monsters and exploring dungeons, with dark, realistic visuals. The player creates a party (up to five members) and explores a maze-like 3D dungeon, fighting random enemies on the way. The heroes also meet adventurers who can be convinced to join the party. The combat engine is turn-based.</plot>

			<plot>Congo Bongo is an arcade platform game similar in many ways to Donkey Kong, but with an isometric perspective. The player takes control of a safari hunter who is searching for an ape named Bongo, determined to punish him for setting the hunter's tent on fire. The game consists of four one-screen stages, each with an objective to jump on platforms and reach the top. Various animals will try to stop the protagonist: for example, in the first level a large gorilla throws coconuts at him. The hero has no offensive abilities and must jump or otherwise avoid enemy attacks. Stages may contain obstacles or hazardous spots that would kill off the main character.</plot>

			<plot>Bomberman was a robot in a bomb making factory who longed for his freedom. Rumors circulated that escaping to the surface would allow the robot to become human. Getting out would be the trick. Each room is inhabited by monsters that must be neutralized and the exit itself hidden underneath bricks.[CR]The first of the Bomberman series, Bomberman is a single-player game with a top down view and simplistic controls. In fact, in addition to movement, the player only has a single ability: placing bombs. Each bomb explodes into a cross-shaped blast (four directions) which can destroy either enemies or blocks. Power-ups may be found to increase the size of the blast, place additional bombs, increase the speed of the Bomberman or to walk through walls. The goal on each level is to destroy all enemies and escape through the exit before the time limit is up. Hitting the exit with a bomb blast releases more enemies which must also be destroyed.</plot>

			<plot>The object of Bosconian is to score as many points as possible by destroying enemy missiles and bases. The player controls a small fighter ship that can move in eight directions, and can fire both forward and backward. Each round consists of a number of green enemy bases that must all be destroyed to advance to the next round (a semi-transparent automap helps identify their location). Each station consists of six cannons arranged in a hexagon, surrounding a central core. The player must either destroy all six cannons or shoot the core to destroy a station, and in later rounds the core is capable of defending itself (opening and closing while launching missiles).[CR]Additionally, the player must avoid or destroy stationary asteroids, mines, and a variety of enemy missiles and ships which attempt to collide with his or her ship. Enemy bases will also occasionally launch formation attacks &#8212; destroying the leader causes all remaining enemies to disperse, but destroying all enemies in a formation scores extra bonus points. A spy ship (worth a random bonus value) will also appear occasionally, which must be destroyed or the round will go to "condition red" regardless of how long the player has taken.</plot>

Energy is lost when the player collides with a monster or gets pushed by a block. The game is based on the two BBC Micro titles Pingu and Rubble Trouble and uses 16 types of blocks; those from the games it is based on along with blocks that can go around corners. There are six different monsters and the game's 400 rooms are not random, but designed individually. Energy can also be gained back, along with bonus points.</plot>

As such, you will have to help the racket (in this case, a nut), to impulse the ball in order to break as much bricks as possible, although there would be others that will be indestructible by your hit. To make your work more complex, there will be some flying enemies that will modify the trajectory of your ball and in the worst of the cases even shot at you, thus reducing your energy bar. In order to avoid being defeated by these creatures, you have one laser which just one projectile that recharges itself occasionally, so you will have to use it wisely too.</plot>

You start with five balls, and the game ends when all five fall off the bottom of the screen. Also included are several game variations, including breakthru (the ball will go straight through bricks instead of bouncing back), timed breakout (you have a time limit to gain as many points as you can), and invisible breakout (the bricks are only visible for a short while after one of them is hit).  Other variations allow you to catch the ball or control the direction of the ball.</plot>

			<plot>The late martial arts hero features in this platform game, with the aim of reaching a wizard in an underground lair, defeat of whom can offer him untold wealth. [CR]In each area you must collect the many strategically-placed lanterns before exiting through the newly-revealed passageway. Some rooms also have escalator-type sections to run along, and the standard (although slightly illogical in this context) ladders. [CR]On the way, you'll fight two enemies - a ninja and a green sumo warrior named Yamo. You can defeat them by punching, kicking, dropping on their heads or luring them into hazardous terrain, or even by making them accidentally hit each other. Even after they are killed, however, they keep coming back for more after a few seconds. Since they can move pretty intelligently (they even climb ladders), you should watch out for them. [CR]There are lots of hazards to avoid by either walking round or jumping - walls of electrical charge and exploding bushes for example.</plot>

			<plot>You play as Chef Pepper and your goal is to make giant hamburgers while evil eggs, sausages and pickles chase you around the game area. To properly make a hamburger you must assemble all of the ingredients together, dropping them from higher up onto the burger area below. To actually do this you have to let Chef Pepper step over every burger ingredient. As soon as an ingredient (a piece of lettuce for instance) has been stepped on, it will fall to the level below. Falling food will squish any enemy following you and will also "bump" any other ingredient below it farther down. Also, as an emergency defense against the enemy food, you can collect pepper shakers which will allow you to puff out a small pepper cloud that will momentarily stun enemies, allowing you to walk past them.Higher levels result in new level design, faster enemies and more ingredients to assemble.The PlayStation 2 version is a port of the original arcade game and comes with a soundtrack disc, a DVD, a guide book and some other bonuses.</plot>

			<plot>Pachinko UFO is a simulator of the popular Japanese gambling pastime of pachinko with added computerised action elements. The main screen resembles a typical pachinko unit with pins for balls to bounce on, spinners for balls to put in motion, and baskets for them to land in. The baskets open and close, and so does the big feature in the middle of the screen, an airplane or spaceship with an integrated fruit-machine like counter. When a score specified by the counters is reached, the game changes to a shooter sequence, where the pachinko balls must be used to shoot down aliens. After that, the game continues to the next table.The control mechanism is similar to golf games, in that the longer you press the button, the more power is given to the ball ejection mechanism. This makes for an experience unlike a real pachinko machine, where the perfect power of the ejector is reached by setting a dial at the right angle, after which it can be locked at that angle. In Pachinko UFO, you must hit a perfect timing instead.</plot>

Some are wandering around in the open, while others have picked out hiding places, which you must approach from certain angles. Trees, rivers and bridges create a varied combat-like terrain and must be incorporated into your thinking. Extra grenades can be collected, and will definitely be required, as they allow you to kill from distance and thus avoid some enemy shots.</plot>

			<title_clean>Columns</title_clean>
			<plot>The game takes place inside a tall, rectangular playing area, as in Tetris. Columns of three different symbols (such as differently-colored jewels) appear, one at a time, at the top of the well and fall to the bottom, landing either on the floor or on top of previously-fallen "Columns".[CR]While a column is falling, the player can move it left and right, and can also cycle the positions of the symbols within it.[CR]If, after a column has fallen, there are three or more of the same symbols connected in a straight line horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, those symbols disappear. The pile of columns then settles under gravity. If this causes three or more other symbols to become aligned, they also disappear and the pile settles again. This process repeats as many times as necessary. It is not uncommon for this to happen three or four times in a row - it often happens by accident when the well is becoming crowded. If the well fills beyond the top of the screen, the game ends.[CR]Occasionally, a special column called the Magic Jewel appears. The Magic Jewel flashes with different colors and when it lands, it destroys all the jewels with the same color as the one underneath it.[CR]Like Tetris, the columns fall at a faster rate as the player progresses. The goal of the game is to play for as long as possible before the well fills up with symbols.[CR]Some ports of the game offer alternate game modes as well. "Flash columns" involves mining their way through a set number of lines to get to a flashing jewel at the bottom. "Doubles" allows two players work together in the same well. "Time trial" involves racking up as many points as possible within the time limit.</plot>

			<plot>Winning entry in the MSXdev'05 coding competition, The Cure is an arcade jump&amp;run heavily influenced by Konami's classic Vampire Killer.The hero, who does look a bit like The Cure's Robert Smith dressed in Mega Man's clothes, starts out in a demonic landscape on his quest to rid the land of the most evil One and his minions. After traversing the cursed landscape, you enter a castle, which will be directly recognisable to anyone who has played Castlevania.Equipped only with a whip, the hero must choose his battles. However, strewn across the levels are keys which will open chests containing bonuses which will render (short-term) invincibility, lengthen your whip or grant you a subweapon, such as a throwing dagger or an hourglass to freeze time momentarily. Subweapons consume hearts, which can be found not only in chests, but by destroying monsters or whipping down candles from the castle's walls.The Cure features a soundtrack with several pieces throughout, swap-screen "scrolling" and both hardware and plotted sprites.</plot>

			<plot>The subtitle "The moving puzzle game" should be interpreted literally; this is a puzzle game where the picture on the puzzle pieces are constantly animated. This can make piecing together the pieces quite difficult, or at least call for strategies not used in conventional puzzles.There are ten puzzles to choose from, and these can be divided into anything from 2x2 to 12x8 pieces. The pieces are not only scattered, they may also be turned upside down. As you play the puzzle, your score starts to count down, and the rate of the countdown is heightened when you execute moves, turn the pieces or use the special features which will reveal a glimpse of the finished puzzle, automatically lay out pieces, or halt the animation. If the score reaches zero, the game is over.</plot>

Some are wandering around in the open, while others have picked out hiding places, which you must approach from certain angles. Trees, rivers and bridges create a varied combat-like terrain and must be incorporated into your thinking. Extra grenades can be collected, and will definitely be required, as they allow you to kill from distance and thus avoid some enemy shots.</plot>

			<plot>Starting Titus' racing series of third-person perspective racing games, Crazy Cars encompasses the American Cross Country Prestige Cars Race. This takes in several parts of the USA, in several powerful cars. Initially you have a Porsche 911 Turbo in your hands, but this can later be upgraded to a Lamborghini and then a Ferrari. There are other cars on the road, which you must avoid contact with. Bumps and divots in the road throws the car off course, as does contact with any of the roadside barriers. Each race must be completed within the time limit.</plot>

			<plot>Three star stones have been hidden in locked treasure chests within a castle inhabited by dragons, guards, spiders, tarantulas wizards and the like. Battle Hero Redham is brave enough to take on such a task, and it is only by obtaining these that he can rescue Taleria.Although Redham is armed with a small supply of daggers (more can be collected), these can only be fired while he is stationary, and the graphics are drawn large so that not much is seen on each screen. This means that a lot of advance route-planning is required, although most creatures can be killed by landing on their heads (horizontal contact with them is however fatal). The tarantulas are perhaps the deadliest foe, as they move so quickly. Treasure chests are located along the route, containing various potions and poisons as well as extra weapons.</plot>

			<plot>Dustins life of crime has caught up with him; hes been incarcerated in the high-security WADRAS prison. In this arcade adventure, it is your job to get him out, within three hours. Getting into fight with guards, or spending too long in the restricted areas to the north, incurs a twenty-minute penalty and returns you to the opening room.The task involves avoiding guards and manipulating valuable objects. The prison is split into three horizontal corridors, each with many rooms containing prisoners. The player can often trade objects with these prisoners, or simply beat them up instead. Once outside you can escape into safety, by crossing a ditch and then navigating a harsh rural area. The game is viewed from a forced perspective, which takes on a 3D effect while outdoors in the open.</plot>

			<plot>Falcon Patrol is a two-way side-scrolling shooter. Players fly a jet across a looping area and must shoot down attacking aircraft. A small radar at the bottom of the screen shows the enemies' position. Fuel and rockets are limited, but there are several landing platforms where the jet can be refueled and resupplied. Before the jet is able to land however, it needs to be brought to a full halt right above the platform, leaving it vulnerable to attacks. Landing platforms can also be destroyed if they are bombed or enemy planes crash into them. As the game progresses, enemies attack in increasingly large and difficult waves.</plot>

			<plot>You are Akineki Nakashima, a 17-year-old Japanese student and computer freak. You developed a program that allows you to communicate with demons via your computer and to summon them. To test your new program, you summon the Norse god Loki. Unfortunately, the newly summoned god kidnaps Yumiko, a girl who studies together with Nakashima. Japan becomes infested with demons, and now it's up to you to traverse the mazes of the demon realm and to rescue Yumiko.This version of Megami Tensei has little to do with the Famicom (NES) version (and with Megaten RPGs in general) gameplay-wise. It is an action game with RPG elements, in which you must fight your way through a series of mazes infested with demons, whom you must defeat in real time combat. You find many items and become stronger as the game progresses, but the emphasis of the game is not on character development but on action-oriented combat and exploration of the dungeons.</plot>

			<plot>Dig Dug is a 1-2 player arcade game in which you have to use your shovel to dig your way through the earth. Stopping you from doing this are two monsters, called Pooka and Fygar, who will continually chase you around. The only weapon that you carry is an air pump, which you can use to inflate the monsters to the point where they explode. (if you start to inflate them but stop doing so, the monsters will get turned back to their normal selves). Furthermore, rocks are scattered throughout the earth, and you can use these rocks to squash them. If the monsters do not find you for several seconds, they will eventually get turned into ghosts, which are able to walk through the earth. They are invincible and cannot be killed. From time to time, vegetables will appear in the center, and you can get these for points. </plot>

Chun can attempt to lock as many aliens as he can behind each door that is available on a particular stage.

			<plot>Dragon Quest II is set a hundred years after the events of the first game. The game's story centers on the prince of Midenhall, who is ordered to stop an evil wizard named Hargon after Hargon destroys Moonbrooke Castle. On his adventure, he is accompanied by his two cousins, the prince of Cannock and the princess of Moonbrooke. Dragon Quest II greatly expands on the series formula from the first game by having a larger party, more areas to explore, multiple heroes and enemies in a battle, and a sailing ship.</plot>

			<title_clean>Dragon Slayer</title_clean>
			<plot>Dragon Slayer is commonly considered one of the progenitors of the action RPG genre. The premise is similar to Roguelikes: the player takes control of a knight who must fight his way through large overhead maze-like dungeons. Unlike roguelikes, the combat in the game is fully action-oriented: the player must approach the monster and "bump" into it in order to inflict damage, at the same time trying to avoid its blows. Combat takes place on the same screen as the exploration; monsters will also sometimes pursue the knight if he attempts to escape. Also contrary to roguelikes, none of the locations or items in the game is randomized.[CR]The player can collect power stones and coins during the journey; the power stones increase the hero's strength, while the coins increase his hit points (health). Defeating enemies also yields experience points, which determine the amount of maximum HP the hero is able to receive. The knight is able to cast magic spells, though they are mostly used outside of combat, for example breaking walls, teleporting, or creating a map of the area.</plot>

			<title_clean>Dragon Slayer II - Xanadu</title_clean>
			<plot>Xanadu was the name of the summer capital of the Mongolian-ruled Yuan Dynasty in 13th century China. The game, however, is set in a fantasy world, its Xanadu being mysterious ruins beneath a prosperous kingdom, where only the bravest adventurers dare to venture. The player takes the role of one of such explorers, who is sent by the king to discover the secrets hidden deep within the ruins.Xanadu: Dragon Slayer II bears many similarities to the first Dragon Slayer, being a dungeon-crawling role-playing game with action combat, primarily revolving around exploration of vast underground mazes. Unlike the previous game, the exploration in Xanadu is conducted from a side-scrolling perspective. There are no platforming elements in the game, and action-based gameplay is confined to combat only. Like in its predecessor, attacking enemies involves simply "bumping" into them, gaining advantage by positioning the hero so that he faces the enemy.Experience points are awarded for defeating enemies. There are two types of experience: fighter and magician, gained from attacking physically and casting spells, respectively. Weapons and armor also gain experience and level up, depending on the amount of time the protagonist equips them for. The main character must visit a temple in order to increase his level.Money can be found in the dungeon or dropped by enemies, and later spent to purchase equipment and items in shops. The player must also regularly feed the hero, as he will get weak and eventually die without food. The game features a "karma" system, which keeps track of the alignment of the enemies killed by the protagonist. If he kills too many "good" enemies, temples might refuse to level him up.</plot>

			<plot>Long ago, an evil dragon named Keela was imprisoned inside a magical dungeon. However time has passed and the magic that sealed the dragon away is weakening. The Drasle family decides that it's time to destroy the dragon once and for all. However only one weapon is capable of doing this, the Dragon Slayer, which is itself sealed away by four magical crowns. The Drasle family decides to take on this quest, and will use every member of the family in order to accomplish it.[CR]The player chooses a character from among five different members of the Drasle family. The choices are: Xemm the father and woodcutter, Mayna the magic-using mother, Roas the brave warrior son, Lyll the athletic daughter and Pochi the domesticated monster-pet. Each character has unique abilities (including attack and jumping abilities) and can only use certain items from those collected. Players can travel back to the Drasle household at any point to change characters.[CR]The object of the game is to enter the large dungeon, itself divided into 5 areas, collecting a variety of items (which as mentioned, can only be used by particular characters) and use them to progress through the dungeon, defeating monsters. Power-ups dropped by monsters include gold, keys, health-restoring bread, magic-restoring potions and health-damaging poison. Gold can be spent on items and other power-ups that are available at various shops hidden inside the dungeon. The player must eventually defeat the four bosses guarding the crowns that seal the Dragon Slayer and then use that weapon to defeat the Kress.</plot>

The story mainly deals with King Egger, the villain, who has captured princess Lala, who is similar to Lolo, only colored red. It is up to Lolo to rescue Lala by travelling through Egger's domain and solving the puzzle rooms laid out before him.You must guide Lolo through a room of tiles and collect all of the Heart Framers in the room. Doing this opens up a Jewel Box, which contains an item. Successfully acquiring the contents of the Jewel Box will clear the room of all monsters and open the way to the next room(s). Luckily for you Lolo has a weapon: the Magic Shot. Two shots can be obtained by collecting certain Heart Framers.There are other types of obstacles in the levels, as well, such as water and Emerald Framers (green blocks that Lolo may push around freely).</plot>

			<plot>The first title in the Bomberman series, released as Eric and the Floaters in the UK, introduces the gameplay concept the series is known for, but otherwise bears little resemblance to the later, more famous entries, with series mascot the White Bomberman nowhere in sight.The game includes 20 single-screen levels. Each consists of a regular grid of indestructible walls, randomly placed destructible walls, and enemies (Floaters) moving between them. The goal of the Bomberman (or Eric in the UK version) is to kill all Floaters present in order to advance to the next stage. There is only one Floater in the first level, but their numbers rise in later stages. To destroy them, Bomberman can drop a bomb at the push of a button, which goes off after a few seconds, hopefully vanquishing an enemy and not himself. If a bomb destroys a wall, hidden items may be revealed, including a treasure chest to be collected for bonus points. The Floaters change between various states indicated by their color, with some states netting higher score for their destruction then others. When they turn red, they follow Bomberman around, which can be used to lure them into strategically placed bombs. Some levels add an extra twist by making Bomberman drop his bombs automatically instead of manually.</plot>

			<plot>The first title in the Bomberman series, released as Eric and the Floaters in the UK, introduces the gameplay concept the series is known for, but otherwise bears little resemblance to the later, more famous entries, with series mascot the White Bomberman nowhere in sight.The game includes 20 single-screen levels. Each consists of a regular grid of indestructible walls, randomly placed destructible walls, and enemies (Floaters) moving between them. The goal of the Bomberman (or Eric in the UK version) is to kill all Floaters present in order to advance to the next stage. There is only one Floater in the first level, but their numbers rise in later stages. To destroy them, Bomberman can drop a bomb at the push of a button, which goes off after a few seconds, hopefully vanquishing an enemy and not himself. If a bomb destroys a wall, hidden items may be revealed, including a treasure chest to be collected for bonus points. The Floaters change between various states indicated by their color, with some states netting higher score for their destruction then others. When they turn red, they follow Bomberman around, which can be used to lure them into strategically placed bombs. Some levels add an extra twist by making Bomberman drop his bombs automatically instead of manually.</plot>

			<plot>The world is veiled in darkness. Winds don't blow, the seas are stormy, and the earth rots. All people can hope for is that the ancient prophecy will be finally fulfilled. "When the world is veiled in darkness, four warriors will come..." And indeed, they come - the four characters you have previously chosen. Their first quest is to free a princess from the evil knight Garland, and then the real journey begins.Final Fantasy is played with an adventuring party rather than with a single character. Before the game starts, the player chooses four characters from six different classes: Fighter, Thief, Black Belt, White Mage, Red Mage, and Black Mage. He also gives the characters names. In the game, the party walks around in a top-down world, visits cities, caves, palaces and other places to buy equipment, rest and get hints and new quests, and fights baddies when they are encountered. Final Fantasy uses a turn-based combat system. In battle, the player gives each character in order a command (attack a particular enemy, cast a spell, use an item, or try to run). Then the characters and the enemies act in a random order. Attacked enemies and party members lose hit points, dying when they reach zero HP. When all the enemies are defeated, living party members receive experience, eventually gaining a level and improving their stats when enough experience is accumulated. Slain party members can be revived in towns for a price. Spells are bought in cities in special shops. The spells are divided into two categories - white magic and black magic. White Mages can only use white magic, Black Mages can only use black magic, and Red Mages can use both. Casting spells in battle uses up Dungeons &amp; Dragons-style spell slots, which, like hit points, can be restored by resting in inns.</plot>

They can be pushed, stacked on top of each other, and even destroyed.  Flappy must strategically take advantage of the gravity and the Red Stones in order to clear the path for pushing the Blue Stone.  Three different types of enemies will try to prevent Flappy from clearing the level, so you must either avoid the enemies, crush them from above with the Stones, or pick up Sleeping Mushrooms to knock them out temporarily.</plot>

It was one of the first video games to feature a ground combat theme and grenades, a precursor to many similarly-themed games of the mid to late 1980s. The original arcade version of Front Line consists of a joystick, a single button, and a rotary dial that can be pushed in like a button. The single button is used to throw grenades and to enter and exit tanks, while the rotary dial controls and fires the player's gun.</plot>

The gameplay of Galaga puts the player in control of a spacecraft which is situated at the bottom of the screen, with enemy aliens arriving in formation at the beginning of a stage, either trying to destroy, collide, or capture the spaceship, with the player progressing every time alien forces are vanquished.</plot>

			<plot>Galaxian is a shoot 'em up in which the player is at the bottom of the screen, with an arrangement of aliens at the top. The player moves left and right to aim at an alien, then shoots a bullet up the screen, and the alien it hits is killed. The aliens are classed as Drones, Emissaries, Hornets and Commanders, with those higher up the screen scoring more points when destroyed. At set intervals an enemy will move down the screen towards you, escorting a bomber, which is a moment of high danger. Clear a wave and another is generated.</plot>

			<title_clean>Ghostbusters</title_clean>
			<plot>Based on the 1984 film of the same name, the Ghostbusters are the ones to call to "bust" any ghost hauntings. They do this through the use of nuclear-accelerated "proton packs" and "ghost traps", whereby the ghosts can be captured and transferred to a secure storage facility at their Headquarters. However New York City has suddenly become a very haunted place, and the number of ghosts has suddenly and dramatically increased. The Ghostbusters must reduce the paranormal psychokinetic energy, the "PK level" in the city, which represents ghost power, before the Temple of Zuul awakens and resurrects an evil goddess called Gozer.Ghostbusters is an action game that features an overhead-view and a side-view. From Ghostbusters HQ, the player must monitor a map of midtown Manhattan for "ghost alarms", as well as for casual, roaming spirits, and plot a route to the alarmed area. Once the route is plotted, the player then controls the purchased Ghostmobile as it drives through traffic. Here, the player is able to capture casual ghosts on the way if they are en route. When the haunted location is reached, the game switches to a side-view. Two of the Ghostbusters will take position, activate their proton beams, and toss a trap to the ground. The player must then use the two Ghostbusters to attempt to lead the ghost(s) over the placed trap. Once activated, the trap springs to capture any ghosts directly above it. A successful capture will earn the player money, which can then be used to purchase new Ghostbusters vehicles and new modifications for it. An unsuccessful capture will see the ghost fly away (after nastily sliming one of the Ghostbusters).As the game progresses, the PK energy in the city increases. The Ghostbusters must keep it under critical levels by being constantly successful at busting ghosts. Eventually the Temple of Zuul will activate, and if the PK levels are still manageable, the Ghostbusters can venture there for a final showdown with Gozer.</plot>

It was created and developed by Satoshi "Pac" Fujishima while working for Compile, the creators of other shoot 'em up games such as Zanac, The Guardian Legend, and Blazing Lazers.[CR]Guardic is unique in that the player can choose stages, which are connected by a maze. Each stage is a non-scrollable single screen and has 1 to 3 groups of different enemies. The player can "buy" ship power-ups like speed, weaponry, and special powers before each stage&#8212;a departure from the traditional scrolling-shooter power-up system. In the end of each stage, the ship could safely fly through a scrollable maze to another stage.</plot>

			<plot>There is trouble in the mines! Volcanic activity has trapped numerous miners, and it is your job to save them. As Roderick Hero, you need to make your way through the dangerous mineshaft avoiding the dangerous creatures and lava, and find out where the miners are located before you run out of energy. To help on your mission, Roderick Hero has several useful types of equipment. A prop pack will allow you to hover and fly around the mineshaft and (hopefully) avoid the many dangers within. Your helmet features a short range microlaser beam which can be used to destroy the bats, spiders, snakes, and other creatures you'll encounter in the mines. From time to time, your path through the mine may be blocked by stone or lava walls. You begin each mission with six sticks of dynamite which can be used to destroy these obstacles (be careful you don't blow yourself up, though!). If you run out of dynamite, your laser beam can also be used to destroy the walls, though this will take longer and use up more energy. As the levels progress, the mine shaft will become longer and more maze-like, creatures will more frequently block the path, and lava walls and pools will appear which are dangerous to the touch.</plot>

			<plot>An evil demon named Varalys casts a curse upon the princess Ann, turning her into three fairies. You control Sir Jim and set out to find the fairies, and then slay Varalys.  Only by vanquishing Varalys can the curse be lifted. Once the princess is restored the kingdom will be saved.Hydlide is an action game with strong role-playing elements. The player has to explore vast wilderness areas, descending into dungeons and eliminating enemies on the way. Combat system is similar to the one implemented in Ys series: attacking enemies requires the player to "bump" into them, at the same time preventing them from attacking the playable character from the sides and the back. The player can change between defensive and offensive stances by pressing a single button. Magic spells can also be used to dispose of the enemies. The player character grows stronger and gains better parameters as he advances in the game.</plot>

			<plot>The third entry in the Hydlide series, continuing its action RPG legacy. Character creation allows the player to choose one of the four character classes: Warrior, Thief, Priest, and Monk. In combat, the protagonist uses melee or long-ranged weapons or casts magic spells. Unlike the previous games in the series, the player is required to press the attack button during melee combat, instead of simply "bumping" into the enemies. There is an internal clock in the game, which makes it necessary for the protagonist to sleep periodically and regain his strength. The main character also has to eat from time to time, otherwise his hit points will gradually decrease. The morality system from the previous game returns: killing friendly creatures will reduce the player's morality level, which will eventually have an effect on one of the game's most decisive battles.</plot>

It runs upon the Namco Galaxian hardware, based on the Z80 microprocessor, with an extra Zilog Z80 microprocessor to drive a DAC for speech; it was one of the first games to have speech synthesis. The King speaks when he is captured ("HELP!"), when he is rescued ("THANK YOU"), and when he is carried away ("BYE BYE!"). The balloons also make the same "droning" sound as the aliens from Galaxian, released in the previous year, and the cannon's shots also make the same sound as those of the player's ship (the "Galaxip") from the very same game.</plot>

			<plot>Our hero must reach Melkhior, a somewhat eccentric wizard who is the only one who can save him. As with most Ultimate titles of the day, reaching him is a long and treacherous challenge, involving both puzzle-solving and action, meaning that each screen requires thorough planning and precise navigation. The game uses the isometric viewpoint in a manner similar to the later Head Over Heels, using monochrome but detailed graphics and techniques to avoid flickering sprites. The game lasts for 40 days and nights - at night your character turns into a werewolf. Ultimate's individual style of eschewing straightforward instructions in favor of feature lists and riddles is put to good use here, with the story detailed in a rhyming poem of sorts.</plot>

The[CR]sequel takes place right after you rescued Aphrodite.  Now you play as both [CR]Popolon and Aphrodite, who will try to to rescue their future baby kidnapped [CR]by a dark priest named Galious. The gameplay is a mix between action and RPG.[CR]You have the side-scrolling actions throughout six worlds and yet at the same[CR]time there are some RPG elements included such as having to find certain items[CR]to complete certain tasks. Maze of Galious stays true to its name with its huge[CR]and sometimes confusing maze-like worlds to be explored.Majou Densetsu II: Daimashikyou Galious is a Role-Playing game, developed and published by Konami, which was released in Japan in 1987.</plot>

			<plot>Sequel to the successful shoot 'm up Laydock. Again two jet fighters go on a joint mission, each space ship managed and controlled by a different player. The ships can be docked side-by-side or end-to-end for greater fire and fighting power. When docked one player is the pilot and the other is the weapons officer. But this game can also be played by a single player. When you progress in the game you can select more advance weapons systems to fight the over 50 different enemy characters. Compared with its predecessor there is not much changed only better graphics, more detailed backgrounds and inter level animations.</plot>

			<plot>This game is a ripoff of the classic arcade game Burgertime. You are a hamburger chef and you're out to build delicious hamburgers. As you run through the colorful maze assembling the ingredients, there is nothing that can stop you. Except maybe the menacing egg, hot dog and pickles that are out to ruin the meal! You can bury them under beef patties, lettuce and buns. Or, knock them out with pepper. To complete a level you have to build four burgers.</plot>

			<plot>You are Agent 17 (codename: "Otto"). Your mission is to secure all top secret documents from a security building and escape in the getaway car, located in the basement of the building.Enemies spies are scattered throughout the 30-floor building and they have only one mission: execute Agent 17 at all costs. There are several ways in which Agent 17 can kill them:Shooting them with his gun.Kicking them by jumping onto them.Shooting a light on the ceiling while in an elevator, dropping the light onto one of them.Crushing them with an elevator.Whenever a light has been dropped, the hallways will be dark for a short period of time, making the enemy spies harder to see. The same holds true for hallways that are already dark.While Otto is in an elevator, he will have complete control of it by moving up or down. Agent 17 can still get killed if he's already in an elevator if a bullet's trajectory is aimed at it.. When Otto is not in an elevator, it will move from floor to floor automatically, even when enemy spies are in it. Otto is able to leap over the elevator gaps, but he must be as close to the edge as possible without falling off in order to make the jump safely. If there is an elevator cable in the way, however, it will block him, causing him to fall. Just because the game is called Elevator Action doesn't mean that elevators are the only means of travel. There are also escalators which you can ride up or down, useful if you want to avoid gunfire and don't have time to jump.Otto must go into the rooms with red doors to collect the top secret documents. If he tries to get to his car without getting all the documents, he cannot escape and must go back and collect the remaining documents. Once he has all the documents and drives away, he then proceeds to the next building.If Otto takes too much time to collect the documents, the alarm will go off, and he will have trouble controlling the elevators, which will take time to react. Bad guys will be especially aggressive. The alarm doesn't go off when Otto loses a life, it only resets after finishing a building. Besides ducking, bad guys may also drop themselves and lay flat on the floor. It's virtually impossible for Otto to shoot bad guys when they do this. Also, Otto cannot duck when in an elevator.</plot>

			<plot>Made in the old Japanese top-down style, Monster Hunter is a straight-forward RPG with a few original twists. You, as a knight, find yourself in a foreign land, and must find the king to be granted passage out of the kingdom. Thus, you find yourself on a typical console RPG quest to find one person, help him find an item, let him tell you where to find another person who can tell you where to find item X, and so on.Outside of the major population centres are random encounters with monsters, which makes the game change to a battle screen. You can equip your character with new weapons and armours, and you have a range of magic spells available to you as well. Fighting is carried out in a peculiar manner, similar to certain golf games. You have a quickly rotating power bar, and pressing the button when it is at its highest makes your attack stronger.</plot>

Shooting at certain enemies will leave a power up pod behind, which can be collected to add more power to the player-controlled space ship (for example special weapons or a force field). Every level features a wide variety of enemies trying to stop the protagonist, with a large boss at the end. Gameplay is for one player or two players alternating. The plot of the game focuses on the planet Gradius, which is involved in three space wars: versus Bacterion, Venom and Salamander.</plot>

			<plot>Nobunaga no Yabou: Zenkokuban is the second game in the Nobunaga series. In the 16th century, Japan's Sengoku ("Warring States") period divided the nation into numerous feudal states, each ruled by a daimyo. These daimyos would often go to war with each other. Many dreamt of conquering the land, becoming the Shogun and ruling the entire country. One of those daimyos was the ambitious Nobunaga Oda, a merciless ruler and a renowned strategist. Players take on the role of Nobunaga Oda or one of many other daimyos to try to conquer Japan.[CR]Players begin by selecting either a 17 regions scenario or a larger 50 scenario. Then, the player must select a daimyo, each of which is rated attributes in several categories; Age, Health, Ambition, Luck, Charm and IQ. As the game progresses, these values change depending on events in the game. The age value represents a time limit of sorts, as an elderly daimyo becomes increasingly likely to die of old age or sickness.</plot>

			<plot>An imaginative action game in which you must guide a ball-shaped craft through a succession of levels. These have a patchwork-quilt type display, with holes to avoid, and squares of various colors, which affect the craft's speed, both within its power potential and into warp, as well as a control-reverser and lots of holes. You can jump and thus avoid these holes, although you have a limited number of them for each level, and it's possible to  adjust the speed through joystick or keyboard control. You also face a time limit on each of the levels, although your time is boosted every time you complete one.</plot>

			<plot>Panel Panic is a clone of Konami's old Amidar. You are a small jellyfish-like thing on a grid. You can only move on the lines of the grid, and as you move, you leave a coloured line behind. When you manage to colour all sides of a cell, it is lit up. When the entire grid is coloured, and therefore all cells are lit up, you have finished the level. Of course, there are nasties following you around, so you have to navigate smartly if you don't want to be caught.As the game progresses, the speed and number of the baddies is increased, but so is your speed. There are also bonus levels, where you gain extra lives by catching a baddie within a time limit.</plot>

			<plot>Pastfinder is a vertically scrolling action game which takes place in the year 8878. You are a member of an elite team of explorers known as the Pastfinders. Your goal is to search deadly, radiated planets for various artifacts and time capsules and to deliver them safely to a base. At the beginning of each level, you will be presented with the map screen and can select which sector you would like to explore next. At first, only a small portion of the map will be visible but as you make your way through the game additional portions become visible. The amount of radiation in each sector may vary, and the map is color coded to indicate just how deadly a particular sector may be. Next you will have an opportunity to equip your ship with supplies; these include heavy metal (slows the rate at which your ship absorbs radiation), beam shields (protects from enemy fire), scramblers (prevent enemies from tracking you), and a deradiator (decreases accumulated radiation). Equipped items will last until your ship crashes or is destroyed, and additional items can be found on the planet surfaces.Finally you will be able to explore the planets surface in the sector you have selected! Controlling your ship, you need to avoid walls, enemy craft and other obstacles on the surface while searching for artifacts. Your ship has the ability to jump over obstacles as well as fire lasers to destroy enemies. Each section of the planet is fill with deadly radiation; the longer you're there, the more radiation your ship absorbs. A gauge at the bottom of the screen indicates your ships radiation level, and if it gets too high the ship is destroyed. From time to time floating crystals will appear; shooting these will reduce your ships radiation level a bit. When you finally reach the end of the sector, you will be returned to the map screen where you can choose another sector and begin exploring again.The game ends when you have lost all of your ships; additional ships can occasionally be found on the planet's surface and are also earned every 5000 points. </plot>

The cock automatically goes into the back room to mate with his wife, who lays an egg shortly afterwards.

The creatures enter the henhouse from either side, and must be moved along by pecking at them. As the cock walks around the henhouse, its energy will decrease. It must be replenished by eating chicken feed at both sides of the henhouse. Only then will the cock move faster.Upon entering the back room, the player must wait until one or more hearts appear at the top of the screen, as they indicate the number of eggs the mother will lay. Since there are ten nests, up to ten hearts can only appear at a give time.When an egg sits in the nest long enough, a egg will hatch out, and the resulting chick will make its way toward the back room, ring the bell outside the door, then go on in. If one of the creatures destroy an egg, or the only egg in the nest hatches out, the player loses a life, and the game is over when all lives are lost.</plot>

Poisonous frogs, eels, scorpions, bats and other hazards get in the way.Pitfall II is the sequel to Pitfall!, the original platform game. Gameplay has remained pretty much the same, with each screen presenting a side view of obstacles to get past, and potentially treasures to collect. The landscape is more maze like, with a variety of paths and dead ends to search. Along the way there are checkpoints the player will encounter. When the player dies, Pitfall Harry will be sent back to the most recently crossed checkpoint.</plot>

			<plot>The player must maneuver a character (Pitfall Harry) through a maze-like jungle in an attempt to recover 32 treasures in a 20-minute time period. Along the way, he must negotiate numerous hazards, including pits, quicksand, rolling logs, fire, rattlesnakes, scorpions, and crocodiles. Harry may jump over or otherwise avoid these obstacles by climbing, running, or swinging on vines. Treasure includes bags of money, gold and silver bars, and diamond rings, which range in value from 2000 to 5000 points in 1000 point increments. There are eight of each treasure type, with 32 in total. A perfect score of 114,000 is achieved by claiming all 32 treasures without losing any points. Points are deducted by either falling in a hole (100 points) or touching logs; point loss depends on how long contact is made with the log. Under the jungle there is a tunnel which Harry can access through ladders found at various points. Traveling though the tunnel moves forward three screens at a time, which is necessary in order to collect all the treasures within the time limit. However, the tunnels are filled with dead-ends blocked by brick walls, forcing the player to return to the surface at one of the ladders, and try to find a way around again, thus wasting time. The tunnels also contain scorpions. The player loses a life if Harry comes in contact with any obstacle (except logs) or falls into a tar pit, quicksand, waterhole, or mouth of a crocodile. The game ends when either all 32 treasures have been collected, all three lives have been lost, or the time has run out.</plot>

He must be defeated before the crystal is exhausted.The typing interface is typical of Level 9 games of the era. Time saving features include an ALL command can apply TAKE and EXAMINE to every object you can see, and the ability to type future commands while the screen is still scrolling.18 spells are available, activated using 3-letter codes you will discover while exploring. These range from confusing or angering an enemy to healing yourself and detecting danger.</plot>

			<plot>Grid Wars is best described as a cross between classic Jeff Minter games such as Gridrunner and Pac-Man. The playfield looks and sounds just like Gridrunner or Matrix. In the middle of the grid is your space ship, and on all four sides of the grid are moving cannons which will try to shoot you down. Your task is to avoid the fire coming from all directions, while picking up the "energon cubes" that will let your ship fly to the next level. With so much happening on screen and the clean graphics, this looks like something Mr. Minter forgot in his desk drawer some day back in 1984.Grid Wars was made for the 2006 edition of the MSXdev coding contest.</plot>

			<plot>Despite it's name, this Q*Bert installment is not a port of the first game, rather it's based on Q*Bert's Qubes. The player doesn't even control Q*Bert, but rather the dragon Wrappy. The gameplay is still focused on forming lines of blocks that match a target color, while enemies constantly enter the playfield. However there are now many different layouts in 50 different stages. Also added are differently colored blobs that function as power-ups when touched. Blue ones for example grant invincibility.[CR]Another addition are two-player simultaneous modes, where both players compete against each other, with or without enemies. The first player to complete a line of five of his target alignment wins. If the time runs out, the relevant blocks are counted, a draw leads to a round of rock-paper-scissors with a random result.</plot>

The player controls a space fighter named the R-9 to defend humanity against a mysterious powerful alien life-form known as the "Bydo". The game is notable for programming which was ambitious for the time, with a wide range of both power-ups and enemies, as well as levels of varying design and length, and sprites larger than a single screen.</plot>

While you try to collect the flags you are chased by hostile cars that try to crash your car. So dodge them by using your smoke screen. Other factors to take into account are a time limit, fuel gauge and that some roads are blocked by an rock!The right bottom corner of the screen shows a radar map that shows your position (black dot), the location of the hostile cars (red dots) and the position of the flags (green dots). Not shown on the map are the special red flags marked with an S. Collect those for bonus points.</plot>

The river is heavily guarded, however, with balloons, ships, choppers, and enemy aircraft trying to stop you. Along the way you will need to fly over fuel stations to refuel your jet and keep flying.The plane is armed with a cannon with unlimited ammo. It can be used to destroy the enemy vehicles and bridges, but a careless player can accidentally destroy a fuel station. Colliding with the riverbanks or with the enemy aircraft destroys your plane and makes you lose a life. </plot>

			<plot>In the year 189 of the stellar calendar, humanity happened upon the ruins of an ancient (and, if the st. 7 decor is anything to go by, rather decadent and malicious) civilization, and sent an archaeological crew to explore them. However, the crew managed to activate the ruins' defense system.[CR]The system operated by identifying the Sol system as the intruders' origin, then launched the Sun-Fish ("Manbou" being Japanese for "Sunfish"), an ultimate weapon bio-mechanical starship capable of destroying an entire solar system and protected by an impregnable force-field bubble. The surviving members of the crew, however, find a chance to stop the Sun-Fish. By using an unearthed Manbou-J (i.e. Junior Sun-Fish) fighter and activating a teleportation system in the deepest part of the ruins, one pilot, Cleaver Mule, can actually get inside the force bubble and destroy the Sun-Fish from there.</plot>

He must kill the sharks in the water by throwing harpoons at them. He can swim to the banks or to ice floes above and below the island. The sharks can eat the ice floes so it isn't safe for the Eskimo to stand on them for much time, or else he'll be eaten too.The fish are held by six rows of nets. The sharks will eat those nets to get the fish, and if an entire row is destroyed, more sharks will come from the sea. The Eskimo can repair the nets by swimming to the place where they were destroyed. The more nets destroyed, the less fish is kept. A stage will end when all sharks are killed. At the end of each stage the remaining fish will be counted and added to the player's score. As the game progresses, sharks become more abundant and destroy the nets faster. The game ends when the Eskimo gets eaten by a shark.</plot>

			<plot>It's a lovely day and Sam is waiting in Central Park to meet his girlfriend Sally. He sees her and walks to her. He only has eyes for her and before he realizes it he finds himself in the New York sewer system.[CR]Three Russian submarines have been located in the New York sewer system and they have blocked off the system. Sam's only way out of the sewer system is to destroy the Russian submarines. Luckily, Sam carries his revolver. Sam can't go back... once he's gone through the City Sewer Department seals the tunnel. Luckily, Sam carries his revolver.[CR]The sewer system has three types of sewer tunnels. Tunnels with solid dry floors, tunnels with a water passage in the middle and tunnels with pits. Sam can walk, run and creep through the tunnels but Sam can't move as quickly in water. Sam can move from tunnel to tunnel by entering one of the passages that appear occasionally on his way. Each time he enters a new sewer, Sam receives a fresh supply of oxygen.[CR]On it's way through the sewer system Sam is under attack by nasties like rats, bats, spiders and more. The ultimate nasties are the Russian submarines. They are located only in water canals. The status bar at the top of the screen contains a distance indicator. It tells you how far Sam has traveled into the sewer. If it's red, it means there's a dreaded submarine at the end of the sewer. The more nasty elements you shoot, the higher you'll score.</plot>

Before any power can be generated and the ship's scanner accessed, a leak must be fixed by finding and using a piece of spare piping.</plot>

I've never played Knightmare 1 before. All I know is that it is a shooter type of game in which you play as [CR]Popolon who tried to rescue his wife Aphrodite from a villain named Hudnos. The[CR]sequel takes place right after you rescued Aphrodite.  Now you play as both [CR]Popolon and Aphrodite, who will try to to rescue their future baby kidnapped [CR]by a dark priest named Galious. The gameplay is a mix between action and RPG.[CR]You have the side-scrolling actions throughout six worlds and yet at the same[CR]time there are some RPG elements included such as having to find certain items[CR]to complete certain tasks. Maze of Galious stays true to its name with its huge[CR]and sometimes confusing maze-like worlds to be explored.Majou Densetsu II: Daimashikyou Galious is a Role-Playing game, developed and published by Konami, which was released in Japan in 1987.</plot>

			<plot>As BLOB, the Bio-Logically Operated Being, you are sent into an unstable planet and charged with the task of preventing it from exploding. This involves collecting various items (the exact combination is different every time you load the game) and taking them to the planet's core.The game is an arcade adventure viewed from the side, with 512 screens arranged in a 16x32 pattern. A teleport system exists, so once you find the codes you can get quick access to different parts of the game.The creatures to avoid are intelligent, getting tougher to predict as you get closer to the centre, but you are armed with a gun and can also try to avoid them. BLOB has a set of platforms which can be used to allow limited vertical movement, but these disappear after a few seconds each use.</plot>

			<plot>This story begins long ago. At that time, the evil Emperor Penguin happened to meet one of his subjects, Lucytesse, of matchless beauty, and he fell madly in love with her.[CR]His love was unrequited, though. She only had eyes for her beloved Pentaro, a young good-looking penguin from the neighborhood. They were a happy couple but the Emperor, in a fit of rage and jealousy, kidnapped Lucytesse, and carried her off to his palace at the South Pole.[CR]Pentaro departed swiftly to rescue her and, after countless perils and adventures in the ice and crevices of the South Pole, finally succeeded in reaching the Emperor's palace and rescuing his sweetheart.[CR]They lived happily together for a while, far from the realms of the Emperor. But he had not had his final say. His revenge would consist of keeping the merry couple apart, kidnapping Pentaro this time and secluding him in a far-off place of his kingdom, far from the South Pole, lost in the boundaries of his realms and utterly unknown to our penguin. He was hoping that Pentaro's own desperation, far from his beloved and unable to escape, would become a punishment worse than death.[CR]His cruelty knew no bounds. But Pentaro refused to resign himself to the fate the Emperor had planned for him. After overcoming numerous hazards amid the lava caverns, underground passageways and rivers, he managed to escape; not even the raging opposition from the island inhabitants who, fearful of the wrath of the Emperor, tried to keep Pentaro at any price, could hold him.[CR]It did not take him long to realize that the unknown place from which he had just escaped was actually located on an island, thanks to the map he had gotten during his confinement. He himself could hardly have imagined how useful it would turn out to be one day...[CR]Pentaro will have to escape from the island if he wants to meet up with his beloved Lucytesse ever again. To do, he is counting on your help!</plot>

There are 7 courses of increasing difficulty, incorporating ramps and bumps which significantly affect the bike's handling. Each course has a time limit you must complete 3 laps of the course within, or it's game over. The further inside the time limit you are, the more points you score.There's a computer opponent, but the scoring isn't affected by whether you beat him just so long as you qualify. There is a two-player mode. A unique feature at the time is the action replay, which can be viewed in slow motion.</plot>

The first job is to get the droid repaired, after which you must regain control of the power generator and the engines.The game is controlled by moving MSB directly, with a teleport facility on the droid allowing you to move one object at a time. Spanner-type devices are mounted from the floor - guiding MSB into the top of these reveals puzzles which can be used to unlock doors to reach other sections of the ship. Before any power can be generated and the ship's scanner accessed, a leak must be fixed by finding and using a piece of spare piping.</plot>

The maze walls can be shot and destroyed. After all white tanks are destroyed, you proceed to the next level. Each level layout calls for different tactics, depending on the formations of the walls. Some spots on certain levels make for perfect ambush tactics, on other levels you must rally back and forth to eradicate the enemy tanks. Occasionally a red tank appears, shoot it for bonus points.</plot>

			<plot>In this game the player assumes the role of a space pilot named Darrian. One day, he receives a report from a nebula space station, from which he learns that nearby human colonies have been attacked by mysterious aliens known as Xenites. Darrian wastes no time, and sets off to protect the humans and stop the aliens.Xenon is an overhead shooter, in which the player controls a vehicle that is able to transform into a tank or a plane. The transformation can be usually performed by player at any time, to combat particular enemies; however, during some sequences the player is forced to use a specific type of vehicle. During the tank gameplay, the player controls the movement of the playfield (up or down) by simply moving the tank in the direction of choice. The game features a 3D playfield (some enemies, for example, will be mounted on hills of sort, where the tank can't shoot them). To combat these, the player needs to transform its tank into a plane. The game then switches to the more familiar gameplay style as seen in other vertically scrolling shooters. The plane has to transform back into a tank again to combat most ground units. Upgrades can be taken from destroyed enemies.</plot>

			<plot>In this game the player assumes the role of a space pilot named Darrian. One day, he receives a report from a nebula space station, from which he learns that nearby human colonies have been attacked by mysterious aliens known as Xenites. Darrian wastes no time, and sets off to protect the humans and stop the aliens.Xenon is an overhead shooter, in which the player controls a vehicle that is able to transform into a tank or a plane. The transformation can be usually performed by player at any time, to combat particular enemies; however, during some sequences the player is forced to use a specific type of vehicle. During the tank gameplay, the player controls the movement of the playfield (up or down) by simply moving the tank in the direction of choice. The game features a 3D playfield (some enemies, for example, will be mounted on hills of sort, where the tank can't shoot them). To combat these, the player needs to transform its tank into a plane. The game then switches to the more familiar gameplay style as seen in other vertically scrolling shooters. The plane has to transform back into a tank again to combat most ground units. Upgrades can be taken from destroyed enemies.</plot>

			<plot>The original commercially-licensed version of Alexey Pajitnov's classic Tetris puzzle game.  Geometric shapes fall from the top of a playfield to rest on the bottom; fit the pieces together, and the line they form disappears.  If the pieces don't form lines and eventually stack up to the top of the playfield, the game is over.  Difficulty increases by dropping the pieces faster and faster over time.</plot>

			<plot>Aboard the lethal Gunship Gladiator helicopter, it is your job to ensure that a coup fails to install a dictator as leader. The game features 12 levels split into three distinct styles. First of all you'll be flying over a city in your helicopter, shooting out tanks by ducking low enough to target them, but also climbing to avoid the skyscrapers in the area. The third section is viewed similarly, but sees you attempting to wipe out the planes mounted on an aircraft carrier.The second section is viewed behind your helicopter in full 3D, and adds helicopters and planes to be shot, with dodging their bullets as you duck down to shoot the tanks being the main challenge.</plot>

			<plot>Topple Zip is a vertically scrolling shooter that is marketed as a racing game. The basic premise is that you control an aircraft and fly in competition against several other, computer controlled crafts. In addition to shooting at your opponents, you may ram into them, and they into you. Doing so may dislodge a pill shaped power-up from them which you can then shoot and collect. [CR]Power-ups exist in various types, including defensive and offensive such as giving you better weapons. There are eight different levels, each of which contain a number of warps which link to other levels. How the levels connect is random each time you play the game. [CR]The goal of the game is to locate a key which is necessary to access the warp which leads to the eight and final level. Collect it from whichever level it is hidden inside of, and access the eighth level before any of your competitors.</plot>

			<plot>TwinBee is a vertical scrolling shooter. The players control cartoon-like spacecrafts with anthropomorphic arms, player one being TwinBee and player two being WinBee. The spacecrafts can be moved in all 8 directions, with one button for regular shooting flying enemies and one button for dropping ground bombs.Power-ups in the form of bells can be collected by shooting clouds. The color of the bell will change if it is shot by the player, assuming one of the possible colors:Yellow: grants bonus points;White: upgrades player's guns to a twin cannon;Blue: increases player's speed (up to five levels);Green: creates image copies of the craft for more firepower;Red: provides a shield to sustain damage.The green and red bells cannot be combined. Alternate power ups can be collected from the ground, such as an alternate bell which upgrades the craft with a three way gun and a star which destroys all enemies on screen.One shot in the middle section of the craft will destroy it. Shots which hit one of the craft's arms will destroy only the arm. If both arms are lost, the craft won't be able to shoot bombs anymore and will have to be repaired by an ambulance.In the two-player mode, TwinBee (cyan craft) and WinBee (red craft) have the same speed and they can join "hand-to-hand" and fire a super blast. Also in two player mode, if one craft is hit by the other from behind, it will fire four multi-directional shots.</plot>

			<plot>Xanadu was the name of the summer capital of the Mongolian-ruled Yuan Dynasty in 13th century China. The game, however, is set in a fantasy world, its Xanadu being mysterious ruins beneath a prosperous kingdom, where only the bravest adventurers dare to venture. The player takes the role of one of such explorers, who is sent by the king to discover the secrets hidden deep within the ruins.Xanadu: Dragon Slayer II bears many similarities to the first Dragon Slayer, being a dungeon-crawling role-playing game with action combat, primarily revolving around exploration of vast underground mazes. Unlike the previous game, the exploration in Xanadu is conducted from a side-scrolling perspective. There are no platforming elements in the game, and action-based gameplay is confined to combat only. Like in its predecessor, attacking enemies involves simply "bumping" into them, gaining advantage by positioning the hero so that he faces the enemy.Experience points are awarded for defeating enemies. There are two types of experience: fighter and magician, gained from attacking physically and casting spells, respectively. Weapons and armor also gain experience and level up, depending on the amount of time the protagonist equips them for. The main character must visit a temple in order to increase his level.Money can be found in the dungeon or dropped by enemies, and later spent to purchase equipment and items in shops. The player must also regularly feed the hero, as he will get weak and eventually die without food. The game features a "karma" system, which keeps track of the alignment of the enemies killed by the protagonist. If he kills too many "good" enemies, temples might refuse to level him up.</plot>

			<plot>The Zaxxon defence system must be destroyed in this isometric-viewed shoot 'em up. The game has three stages, first taking you through Asteroid City, which is heavily protected by aircraft, guns and missiles. Many barriers are alarmed, leaving you with limited space to progress through, and fire must constantly be dodged.Stage two is a space shoot out against hordes of enemy aircraft - those you failed to destroy in the first part of the task. Complete this and you reach the final battle with Zaxxon, the game looping with increased difficulty if you can survive the first time. There are three distinct skill levels, while controls involve using forward to dive and back to climb, in the manner of flight simulation.</plot>
