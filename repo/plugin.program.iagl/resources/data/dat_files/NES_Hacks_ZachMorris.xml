        <emu_comment>Hacks are modified versions of old games. Some games get minor tweaks such as retranslations or simple gameplay improvements, others get complete overhauls that completely transform the original game. This is a list of just some of the Nintendo hacks available today.</emu_comment>

    <plot>This hack was started back in December 2007. Most of the levels were finished[CR]by mid February. The title screen was ripped from the translated NES ROM[CR]"Adventure Island 4''. Since I am an amateur ROM hacker (is there a[CR]professional ROM Hacker?) in every sense of the word, this took much longer to[CR]edit than someone with more experience and abilities. Also you'll notice that[CR]the palette on the title screen is a little off :P All 8 worlds and 8 levels[CR]each have been altered. (with the exception of world 4-4 although most enemies[CR]have been changed) This is not meant to be a "hardtype" hack but later levels[CR]can be very challenging. All levels can be completed without any enhancements.[CR](hammer, dinosaur etc.) However it is recommended that you save your items for[CR]later levels. I've tested this patch thoroughly but there is always a chance I[CR]missed something somewhere.

    <plot>This is the hack of SMB1 with all new levels and the new World A of this game.[CR]This is for SMB champions who have already completed World 8 in the original[CR]SMB1. The Password is "TO SELECT A WORLD" You can look in the zip file named[CR]Password.txt or just copy that text from your SMB Utility and paste it to your[CR]password. Unmasking your password is much easier. Authors Note: The original[CR]creation of this game has been removed including the authors website.

Utility level editor. I used it to edit the levels, text,[CR]and lives.[CR]Mana, for his/her SMB Title Editor, although it causes[CR]everything to be green but perfect for Castle Palettes. Manas editor is much[CR]easier than Betas which I havent learned from it yet.[CR]Brian Bennewitz for[CR]making Transhexlation, I used it on everything on SMB1 for Palettes, General[CR]Setting (That SMB Utility cant do. Like setting to World D.), for[CR]export/importing levels from my unreleased hack and onto another hack and a[CR]few TSA Block Behaviour changes. [CR]sseta for the TSA and Background Editor[CR]which I changed the TSA Blocks for the Mushroom Platforms.[CR]DJ Bouche for[CR]the SMB Relocaverburator which I coped SMB Deluxes Map data. Although the[CR]levels may not be accurate but there is an object limit which it cant carry[CR]more than 128 and few other crap you see in my hack. [CR]??? for the Spikes[CR]Patch, I found it on some japanese site but I do not know who credited this[CR]one.[CR]_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ [CR]Much[CR]Special Thanks to:[CR]Spel werdz rite for the level offsets. Although I do[CR]know it but wasnt written down. I used it to change the level Pointers in each[CR]world.[CR]AP for his/her Aftersmb2j hack and the entire site which inspire me[CR]to do this. (Not really since I used SMB utility for over a year and a half.[CR]That makes me a Professional SMB1 level and ASM hacker.)[CR]Frank15 for his[CR]SMB1 hacks as well. Which he really give me ideas for this hack.[CR]Andres for[CR]mentioning the term "Encyrpt" which I cant understand but slipped after the[CR]last minute after logging out the Ice Board and going to the movie to see[CR]"When a stranger calls" but he have trouble unlocking the password. [CR]Googie[CR]for mentioning the Password not being in the .txt document which it does[CR]attract them more easier.[CR]And for the Graphics, even though Im too lazy to[CR]make one.

    <plot>This is the world's first Astyanax level hack. This hack was being worked on[CR]and off for almost 2 years. You'll notice that the levels and text has been[CR]changed, and there's also some minor graphics changes. People who'll remember[CR]this game can tell you that the gameplay is similar to Legendary Axe on the[CR]TG-16. And people'll also enjoyed the original game will get get their[CR]Astyanax fix. :p Well, I hope you all enjoy playing this hack as much as I had[CR]fun making it. :)[CR]Read Me:[CR]Astyanax Remix (Googies Astyanax Hack)[CR]Whats been done...[CR]Well, since the editor doesnt have enemy/item[CR]support I edited the levels the as best as I could, Its a pretty straight[CR]foward hack. Theres some tricky jumps but theyre not impossible to pass.[CR]Since the level palettes are fuggin ugly in the original game, I edited[CR]the level palettes. I also did some minor grahpics changes, like putting[CR]Medusas tits into this hack (NOA took those out in the american relase) And I[CR]also put the font from Zelda Links Awakening along with some other tweaks. I[CR]really suggest you play the original game before playing this hack so youll[CR]notice the differences.[CR]Youll also notice I changed the story line. Some[CR]might find it either funny, stupid or offensive. I cant please evertbody, so[CR]there. :p [CR]I used Mega-Dogs AstyaEd editor to make this hack which you can[CR]get at [CR]http://dogsoft.net/index.php?page=programs&amp;id;=astyaed [CR]I[CR]started working on this hack in August of 2004, when Tek Hacks was still[CR]around. Im glad I finally finished it, I cant belive it took almost two years.[CR]Well, enjoy the worlds first level hack of Astyanax. See yas...

    <rom name="EmuROMHacks/ROM_Hacks_2.zip/NES%2FAstyanax%20-%20The%20Movie%20%28X%29.nes" size="262160"/>
    <plot>Here's the classic NES game Astyanax as I think it ought to be. Read the[CR]included guide for details, or just play the game and see for[CR]yourself.[CR]Read Me:[CR]Why I made this modification:[CR]When I was a[CR]callow youth, Astyanax really appealed to me, such that I rather tended to[CR]overlook the various flaws in this game. True, even at the time, the games[CR]cinematics and controls seemed an obvious pale imitation of Ninja Gaidens. To[CR]a lonely and put-upon young boy stuck in a horrific public school and just[CR]beginning to develop an interest in girls, however, the idea of leaving school[CR]to go rescue the girl of ones dreams in a swords-and-sorcery-style fantasy[CR]world with a pretty little fairy companion at ones side did have a certain[CR]powerful visceral appeal to it.[CR]Flash forward a couple of decades to now,[CR]and lately having my attention drawn to the cantankerous block lettering, the[CR]characters overly passive manner of speaking, and the sloppy grammar and[CR]spelling has begun to spoil my fond memories of this game. Clearly, whoever[CR]translated and localized it either wasnt a native English speaker, or just[CR]didnt care. (If the former, your failures at understanding our admittedly[CR]complicated and highly variable language are hereby excused; if the latter,[CR]may you spend a small eternity trapped in chat rooms with other lazy dolts[CR]whove never bothered to learn their native language.)[CR]In any event, I have[CR]therefore undertaken improving and refining the cut scenes. Ive always thought[CR]that, with a little cautious editing, anybody with a bit of money and even[CR]half a brain could adapt this video game into a movie that people might[CR]actually pay good money to see and enjoy watching. Though the odds of that[CR]ever happening seem increasingly remote with every year that passes (because[CR]Hollywood has never yet employed anyone with half a brain to adapt any video[CR]game into a movie), Ive titled this game accordingly. In addition to reworking[CR]the narration and dialogue, players may notice Ive also made a few minor[CR]tweaks to the artwork.[CR]FAQ:[CR]Q. Is Astyanaxs name really from Greek[CR]Mythology? How do you pronounce that?[CR]A. As a matter of fact, yes, but[CR]thats pretty much the only connection, apart from the protagonists vaguely[CR]Hellenistic-looking armor and some of the architecture (Ryogoku and Telugamn[CR]in particular). The Astyanax of Greek Mythology was the Trojan Hectors young[CR]son the Greeks threw from a tower to his death so that he would never return[CR]to avenge his father and reestablish the royal dynasty. Considering his cruel[CR]fate, its probably a good thing that the only connection the hero of this game[CR]has to him is his name. One subject that would definitely be worth exploring[CR]if a movie adaptation of this game were to be made would be why Astyanaxs[CR]parents chose to give their boy such a bizarre and inauspicious name in the[CR]first place.[CR]As for the pronunciation, thats Uh-STY-uh-nax, and not "As-[CR]tee-an-ax" as Ive heard some uneducated people on YouTube pronounce it.[CR]Granted, I imagine if anyone were named that now, his friends probably would[CR]just call him Asty for short, but the full name should still be pronounced[CR]with the same sharp "sty" as in polystyrene and styrofoam.[CR]Q. Speaking of[CR]weird names, wasnt Rosebud a sled or something? Who names a little girl[CR]Rosebud?[CR]A. Yes, yes, I can see youve been studying your film trivia. As[CR]far as I know, this game has absolutely no connection whatsoever to Orson[CR]Welles film Citizen Kane. As for who names a kid Rosebud, childrens book[CR]author Dawn Apperly, for one (see Princess Rosebud: Perfectly Perfect[CR]Princess, for example) and the makers of the feature-length fairy-tale movie[CR]adaptation Sleeping Beauty (1987) for another. Also, the playwright George[CR]Garrett named the Kings daughter this in his play Sir Slob and the Princess.[CR]Actually, its a rather popular name in some circles; so quit being such a[CR]provincial snob, wiseguy.[CR]Q. Why did Astyanax originally claim to be a[CR]Freshman at high school, and yet later mention he was sixteen? Did he flunk[CR]and get held back a grade or something?[CR]A. That apparent inconsistency in[CR]the original game is almost certainly a translators error. In Japan, high[CR]school runs exclusively from the 10th to 12th grades. By Japanese standards,[CR]Astyanax would therefore be a first-year high school student. The translator[CR]apparently picked up on the American term for a first-year high school student[CR]being "freshman" but not on the fact that our high schools typically run from[CR]the 9th to 12th grades and Astyanax should therefore be in his second year. In[CR]this refinement, Ive fixed Astyanaxs narration accordingly.[CR]Q. Is "ax" or[CR]"axe" the proper spelling?[CR]A. Check your dictionary; theyre both legitimate[CR]spellings. I still prefer the latter, though. Also, a comma really ought to[CR]have a space after it.[CR]Q. What was the deal with Astyanax going all wussy[CR]and asking "Can you defeat me?" near the end?[CR]A. More dubious translation,[CR]and its an example of that overly passive voice the characters use a lot. In[CR]Japanese, asking a guy whether he can beat you in battle, even in a courteous[CR]tone, probably does sound like a pretty confident challenge. In English, well,[CR]youve got to say what you mean when goading someone into a fight. Ive adjusted[CR]that line to a much more appropriate challenge in my version as well.[CR]Q.[CR]How the %&amp;@* do I get past Marshy (Level 4-1)? That levels %&amp;$@*# impossible![CR]Couldnt you have fixed that?[CR]A. Hey, come on; its not that difficult! I[CR]managed to slog through it way back when I was a kid playing this game on my[CR]console and there were no emulators with their cheating save slots to be had.[CR]Compared to, say, Level 6 of Ninja Gaiden, Marshys nothing. A bit of advice[CR]that holds especially true on that level, though: dont waste any of that[CR]miraculous power clearing the screen when everything around you is constantly[CR]respawning. Switch over to the time-stopper instead, as the manual tells you[CR]how to do. (You have read the original manual for this game, havent you? Join[CR]the Nintendo Fun Club today, Mac!)[CR]Q. Got any other advice?[CR]A. Believe[CR]it or not, all the hacking and slashing in this game does require some[CR]strategy, even though its nowhere near so sophisticated as, say, the swordplay[CR]in Zelda 2: The Adventure of Link. Ill leave you with three quick tips:[CR]1.[CR]Patience and timing are everything; he who gets frustrated and starts flailing[CR]is lost. Take every breather you can so you can build up that power guage and[CR]make every stroke count.[CR]2. A lot of the enemys tactics are more[CR]psychological than physical: resist the urge to chase any critter that just[CR]sucker-punched you, as this is one of the surest ways to get knocked into a[CR]pit.[CR]3. When everyones either throwing things at you or flying at you, use[CR]the Klingon males classic method for surviving courtship: duck a lot.</plot>

    <plot>BBM is a complete overhaul of original Bubble Bobble, with much, much harder[CR]stages and some neat graphics and palette changes. Note that it is possible to[CR]beat the first 15 levels without a continue, not really that hard, hehe. All[CR]levels have been hacked. Enemy Graphics have been given a facelift or totally[CR]changed.

It edits levels, graphics, and some other little things. I[CR]designed this[CR]to be a hack to be quite difficult in some areas. Especially[CR]later in the game. Unless you are very skilled in this game, you [CR]will find[CR]getting through the first 15 levels (initial release) to be a challenge.

Very good program.[CR]3. Bubblizer by Codemaster2000 The only useful[CR]thing this editor offered was starting lives editing.[CR]4. Tile Layer by[CR]SnowBro The DOS version. I love this tile editor![CR]5. Tile Layer Pro by[CR]SnowBro The Win version. I used it to copy and paste some gfx and stuff.[CR]6.[CR]Hexpose by SnowBro Hex editor. Used for editing palettes. Yay![CR]7. NES Pal[CR]ed. by The_Fake_God An NES palette editor. I searched for palettes with this[CR]baby![CR]8. BBLE by Blades Another level editor.

    <plot>This is an overhaul of the original Castlevania done using Stake, Tilelayer[CR]Pro and Hex Workshop. Many changes from the original have been made during the[CR]production of this hack. It took quite a while to complete, but the result was[CR]well worth the effort. All graphics of characters were done by me, bit-blade,[CR]moonchilde and revility. Bit-Blade and I also created the stage's background[CR]graphics and Several changes involving the game's engine were done through[CR]hexadecimal by me. Some of these changes include jumping higher and whip while[CR]walking (which is sort of a mixed blessing.), and the drop item ratio. Several[CR]features were used in Blood Moon that were prominent in the original[CR]Castlevania, but not utilized. For example; the water's splash effect, having[CR]to break a path through the wall to proceed, and bit-blade's unique tile[CR]solidity glitch, and a few booby traps along the way which all make for[CR]substantially more interesting gameplay. This is a very difficult game, for[CR]master vampire killers only. If you happened upon it by mistake, then run! far[CR]far away! wuahaha!</plot>

    <plot>This is a hack of the original Castlevania for NES that optomon and I have[CR]been working on for over a year.

So what's changed? * New GFX * New levels * New level paths * New map *[CR]New sub-weapon * New music * Music on the title screen * New enemies * New[CR]bosses -STORY- 1476, Romania. A terrifying castle rises up from the mist.[CR]Along with the castle rose a dark powerful being named Count Dracula Vlad[CR]Tepes. A man named Trevor Belmont was fated to defeat the powerful vampire,[CR]aided by a witch named Sypha, Dracula's own son Alucard, and a pirate named[CR]Grant DeNasty. Together the team traversed the dark halls of Castlevania,[CR]defeating the count and his countless minions. In 1777 a young child was born,[CR]and abandoned on a merchant ship with nothing but a headband with a mysterious[CR]crest, and the name Armund. The sailors raised the child on the high seas, and[CR]taught him the ways of being a sailor. Armund grew to be one of the greatest[CR]men that the merchant ship ever saw. Late 1797, word started to spread of the[CR]legends of Count Dracula, and his tyranny in the land of Romania. It was about[CR]that time, that Armund ran into an old Romanian man in Serbia. The old man[CR]knew a lot about the history of Count Dracula, and his reign of terror in[CR]Romania. The old man recognized the crest on Armund's bandanna, and told him[CR]that it belonged to the DeNasty clan, and that his ancestor helped defeat[CR]Dracula. Armund decided to leave his life on the high seas to seek out more[CR]answers about his ancestry. Romania, 1800. It's been 3 years since Alucard[CR]defeated his father in battle and has gone into eternal slumber. Armund's[CR]search has taken him to the mountains of Romania, not far from the town of[CR]Jova. A mysterious letter hinted that he might be able to find answers in the[CR]castle of Count Olrox, a servant of Count Dracula's. Armund set out of Olrox's[CR]castle, armed only with an enchanted barbed rope from Serbia.

    <plot>Castlevania Remix is a hack of Castlevania which incorporates the use of a few[CR]simple tones for the palette in order to create a bit of a sepia/black-and-[CR]white quality to the game, which lends itself very well to Castlevania, making[CR]it look more like a silver-age era monster film, which is definitely where the[CR]idea for Castlevania originated. Some might scoff at the use of a palette like[CR]this, but making the graphics look this detailed on the NES with a small set[CR]of colors is no small feat. Besides the graphical changes, the level layouts[CR]are also changed, and in some spots it's a lot more difficult, and in others[CR]it's easier. One thing to watch out for, though, is a distinct lack of hearts,[CR]which makes bosses a lot harder to defeat since you will only get off a few[CR]shots with your weapons before having to resort to your whip. Oh, and also be[CR]on the look-out for camouflaged staircases in a few spots- if you can't find[CR]them, you may find yourself stuck. Also of interest is that the soundtrack has[CR]been rearranged slightly, and in some spots modified-but the sound hacks still[CR]need a little work. Perhaps in a future version.</plot>

    <plot>Castlevania Retold is-as the name suggest-a retelling of the original NES[CR]Castlevania. I wanted to keep the original story intact (Many of the CV games[CR]are retellings of the first one, this is no different) but offer new levels[CR]and graphics, this is just that. All the levels have the same themes to them[CR]they originally had, but with new layouts and enemy placement, I also wanted[CR]to keep the classic feel to it, which is why I used mostly graphics from CV2[CR]and 3. There are very few custom graphics in the hack, I'm not good with[CR]graphics at all, but I did make a new title screen using the new CV logo[CR](Which Moonchile later enhanced) and enhanced some of the orignal sprits. Any[CR]Castlevania fan will probably like this, but until recently I didn't notice[CR]it's one downside: It's hard. As I made this hack I pretty much learned how[CR]everything in CV's game engine works, the exact timing of enemies and such.[CR]So, while I can play through most of it with no problems even my friends who[CR]are good at Castlevania die several times on the first level. (Sorry about the[CR]short review, I suck at these kind of things...)[CR]Read Me:[CR] |Version[CR]2.0 - 6/24/04[CR] |Hack by Dragonsbrethren[CR] |Presented by TEKHacks[CR]|http://www.tekhacks.net[CR]____________________________________________________________________________________________|________________________________[CR]Document[CR]is to be viewed maximized in 1020x740 resolution, anything less is for the[CR]sightless...[CR]-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]___________________________[CR]\\[CR] Contents: |[CR]---------------------------|[CR] I.

How-to[CR]use[CR]-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]First things first, you will need to download three things:[CR] 1. Lunar IPS[CR](http://fusoya.cg-games.net)[CR] 2. FCE Ultra[CR](http://xodnizel.net/fceultra)[CR] 3. A Castlevania ROM (Cant provide this,[CR]sorry)[CR] How to use the IPS patch:[CR] If this is your first time using[CR]Lunar IPS you will have to do the following:[CR] [CR] *Run Lunar IPS[CR]*Click on Apply IPS Patch[CR] *Find the IPS patch made for your version of the[CR]ROM (Castlevania Retold (PRG 0).ips or Castlevania Retold (PRG 1).ips)[CR]*Select it[CR] *Make a copy of your Castlevania ROM[CR] *Select it[CR] *Apply[CR]the patch[CR] Your ROM is now patched, rename it Castlevania Retold.nes[CR] If[CR]you dont know which version of the ROM you have try them both.[CR] If youve[CR]used Lunar IPS before you can simply run the IPS and follow the patching[CR]steps.[CR] How to run it in FCE Ultra:[CR] (If youre reading this maybe you[CR]shouldnt be playing a hack just yet... but Ill assume youre just a newbie to[CR]FCE Ultra)[CR] *Run fceu.exe[CR] *Configure the emulator to your liking. Also,[CR]make sure to load fX3s palette if you want to use it.[CR] *When youre ready[CR]open the ROM through the file menu[CR] *Enjoy![CR] Of course, if you want you[CR]can use different IPS patching programs or emulators, those are just my[CR]favorites.[CR]_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________[CR]IV. Not-so[CR]FAQs[CR]-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Q: Why is this section called "Not-so FAQs?"[CR] A: No one has actually asked[CR]me any of these questions, I predict people will, however.[CR] Q: No custom[CR]palette in this version?[CR] A: Nope, too many complaints. It should look good[CR]using any NES palette, I suggest the one made by fX3.[CR] Q: Why are all the[CR]new graphics ripped?[CR] A: You would not want to play with my custom[CR]graphics, trust me.[CR] Q: The first door you come to is broken...[CR] A: No[CR]its not, its locked, the answer lies below your feet...[CR] Q: I ripped up the[CR]carpet and there was nothing there, what gives?[CR] A: Ugh, theres a second[CR]door below the locked one...[CR] Q: Wheres this "CVC Revision" youve been[CR]talking about at?[CR] A: I handed that task off to redrum, I am no CV master,[CR]and I think hell do a better job with it.[CR] Q: I found a glitch, what do I[CR]do?[CR] A: Unless its a major gameplay glitch, I will not be fixing any[CR]glitches, this is the last version of CV Retold.[CR] Q: Its too hard, can you[CR]make an easy version?[CR] A: I was making an easy version called the[CR]"Craptacular Players Edition (CPE)" but I canceled it.[CR] Q: Its too easy,[CR]can you make a hard version?[CR] A: One is in the works, its called the "CVC[CR]Revision" (For the guys at the Castlevania Corner)[CR] [CR] Q: Why are the[CR]levels/moving platforms/spike crushers placement so similar to the original[CR]game?[CR] A: When this hack was started Stake couldnt edit those last two[CR]things and I wasnt that good with the editor yet.[CR] Q: Why didnt you fix[CR]them in this version?[CR] A: I did, somewhat, but many people liked my[CR]original levels designs so I left most of them intact.[CR] Q: Any new CV hacks[CR]planned for the future?[CR] A: Yes, a new CV Retold-style hack without all the[CR]problems found in this one. Thats all Im[CR]saying.[CR]_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________[CR]V.

    <plot>This game is a hack of Contra which completely alters the level layouts,[CR]making the game much harder than the original. The bosses have also been[CR]altered. Some of the bridges in the Jungle level don't blow up and it's[CR]difficult to tell where you can jump out of the water because of the new[CR]layout, with certain areas where the player jumps down to a different part of[CR]the water when they're already in it. The Base levels now take up the whole[CR]screen in size and the targets have been changed, although strangely the[CR]enemies still spawn in the same spots that they did in the original. Some[CR]targets are also invisible here for unknown reasons. The gun targets here also[CR]fire more often than they did originally. The player is now given 5 lives[CR]instead of 3 and whenever they lose a life, they keep the gun that they had[CR]when they died. The audiovisuals are the same, apart from the title screen[CR]which doesn't have the Contra logo or Konami copyright. The Base levels also[CR]look considerably different, despite using the same tiles. Many have[CR]criticised this hack for being almost unplayable due to the changed layouts.[CR]Prepare for a not so normal Contra experience as it will be very difficult!</plot>

    <plot>In the spirit of The Year of Luigi, which in fact did NOT end in 2013, Luigi[CR]is being inserted into classic Mario games in place of the red plumber! This[CR]was originally inspired by an April Fools' joke on NintendoLife.com teasing[CR]Luigi versions of classic NES games and later Nintendo's own Luigi Bros. and[CR]Dr. Luigi for Wii U. Introducing: Dr. Luigi! It's even got a little trailer![CR][Check it out!](http://youtu.be/2knU_8u9VFI) Features: * Dr. Mario is now Dr.[CR]Luigi! All of his sprites are redrawn to feature the taller, thinner brother[CR]in medical attire. His appearance is based on other 80's/90's games that[CR]featured him rather than his modern appearance. * New title logo based on the[CR]logo from the Wii U Dr. Luigi. * New, completely redrawn virus designs based[CR]on the ones from the Wii U title. * New color palettes - pills, viruses,[CR]backgrounds, etc. Most of the changes are based on the Wii U Dr. Luigi. *[CR]There's been a slight redesign of a certain something else, too... Beat HI[CR]speed on level 20 to see it!

The one I used was named "Dr.[CR]Mario (JU).nes".[CR]In the archive Ive included three different patches to[CR]suit different users[CR]tastes. Here are the differences between[CR]them:[CR]DrLuigi_lite.ips[CR]---------[CR]The standard Dr. Mario with minor[CR]changes. Only the logos and Mario himself[CR]are edited in this one. This is[CR]for the purists out there who just want a[CR]straight brother swap. I like to[CR]say this is "how Nintendo would do it".[CR]DrLuigi.ips[CR]---------[CR]All of[CR]the features listed above are included in this patch. I like to say[CR]this is[CR]"how Nintendo would do it if they decided to put some effort into[CR]it".[CR]DrLuigi_yole.ips (Dr. Luigi: Year of Luigi[CR]Edition)[CR]---------[CR]All of the features listed above plus an extra bar on[CR]the title screen[CR]displaying "The Year of Luigi". I almost didnt include[CR]this idea but a good[CR]amount of people thought it was cool...while another[CR]good amount thought it[CR]wasnt.

He also went to handicraft museum in Jakarta Raya and damaged an[CR]Indonesian artifact then took its material for complement his evil creation.[CR]~Enjoy the new adventure... And sorry if you find bugs in my hack.[CR]=)[CR]Read Me:[CR]++++++++++++++++[CR]+ INTRODUCTION[CR]+[CR]++++++++++++++++[CR]---&lt;(ASSALAMUALAIKUM WR. WB)&gt;---[CR] Im beginner[CR]hacker from Indonesia.[CR] My age is still 17 years old when I submitted[CR]this.[CR]+++++++++++++++++++[CR]+ GREAT THANKS TO +[CR]+++++++++++++++++++[CR]1. Matrixzs MegaFLEX, CSA, and his "Capcom 6C80 Sound Engine/Music Format[CR]Documentation".[CR] 2. A little bit datas from Kuja Killer.[CR] 3. Rockman 3[CR]Editor by Rock5Easily.[CR] 4. YY-CHR, the great tile editor.[CR] 5. FCEUX,[CR]great emulator for searching ASM datas.[CR] 6. Narak-Narakmak and Insectduel[CR]as tester.[CR] 7. RHDN, the great place of ROMHacks.[CR]++++++++++++[CR]+[CR]PATCHING +[CR]++++++++++++[CR] (Im Indonesian, sorry for my English)[CR]Please patch this ips file into Mega Man III, not Rockman[CR]3.[CR]++++++++++++++++++++++[CR]+ WHATS DIFFERENTS?[CR]+[CR]++++++++++++++++++++++[CR]---&lt;( I. GRAPHIC )&gt;---[CR] All level with new[CR]graphics and...[CR] Yes, some graphics which describing Indonesia and some[CR]tilesets made by me.[CR] Its really fun to change NES graphic.[CR]---&lt;( II.[CR]MUSIC AND SOUND )&gt;---[CR] Urrgghh, hacking this section is a major nightmare[CR]for n00b like me.[CR] Really, I dont know any NES music ASM until I found[CR]Matrixzs document about[CR] "Capcom 6C80 Music Format Documentation" and some[CR]practices.[CR] Finally, changing the NES music is really, really, and really[CR]easy by translating[CR] notes one by one. But Im very tired when adjusting the[CR]tempo, instrument and notes[CR] transpose.[CR] And the musics from not[CR]compatible engine (so, I must open PianoRoll Editor to[CR] translating note[CR]one by one. Very easy even with jump, loop and break instruction...[CR] But[CR]kinda tired), they are :[CR] 1. Mega Man 9 : Opening 3 (as get weapon)[CR] 2.[CR]Mega Man 8 : Stage Select (as stage select. Uurrrgghh, Terrible ripping)[CR]3. Sonic The Hedgehog : Level Clear (as beating boss, with brutal tempo due[CR]its timing)[CR] 4. Sonic The Hedgehog : Spring Yard Zone (as Needle Man stage.[CR]Sorry if its terrible)[CR] 5. Sonic The Hedgehog : Star Light Zone (as 1-2[CR]Wily stage. Again, Sorry if its crappy)[CR] 6. Mega Man 2 : Quick Mans Stage[CR](as Spark Man stage)[CR] 7. Mega Man 1 : Final Boss (as 5-6 Wily stage, with[CR]drums up)[CR] 8. Super Mario Bros. : Flagpole (as beating game. Honestly, its[CR]kinda horrible in My MM3 hack)[CR] And all I use sound effect from MM5 (just 3[CR]sound effects).[CR]---&lt;( III. LEVEL )&gt;---[CR]---&lt;( IV. TEXT )&gt;---[CR] The most[CR]text entirely changed in global language (English), althrough Im suck at[CR]English grammar.[CR]---&lt;( V. GAMEPLAY )&gt;---[CR] Major AI changed, more sliding[CR]and climbing speed, also some enemies speed are brutal.[CR] But, my hack is[CR]easy enough. And there is many secrets in my hack, like you can kill[CR]Needle Man instantly by certain weapon at Needle Mans certain action. The[CR]weapons[CR] AI are changed too (except Spark Shock).[CR] Finding these codes[CR]in FCEUX breakpoint are super duper easy. Ive found many, many[CR] codes by[CR]reading RAM only and using Read/Write Breakpoints, myself. Especially the[CR]LDA,[CR] ADC, SBC, and STA instruction.[CR]---&lt;( VI. OTHER )&gt;---[CR] - Faster[CR]vertical scrolling like MM5 (the original is slower)[CR] - Y register for[CR]sprite speed addition (variation horizontal speed)[CR] - No delay recovering[CR](this is very painful to search the code)[CR] - Faster fading (by changing LDY[CR]value to 02)[CR] - MM5 teleportation method (for Rushes)[CR] - Sound Effect[CR]addition (MM5 Gravity Switch, MM5 Gravity Hold and MM5 Power Stone)[CR] -[CR]Maximum E-tank is just 5 (because the difficulty are easy enough)[CR] - The[CR]robot master area and weaknesses is all about my country, Indonesia (as[CR]knowledge)[CR] - Cannon sprite assembly from MM10 (extremely[CR]different)[CR]+++++++++++++[CR]+ KNOWN BUG +[CR]+++++++++++++[CR] 1. In[CR]parallax scroling (Original like Gemini Mans stage, but in my hack not) after[CR]you die,[CR] the background moved to the scary position while READY appeared.[CR]But, its actually[CR] an original bug, I mean, it really happen in Gemini Mans[CR]stage too.[CR] 2. Original bug too, but cause with emulator, the pause menu[CR]gltched (perhaps because scanline[CR] read problem) in parallax scrolling and[CR]second battle with Gamma (cause by Gammas Hand).[CR] Solved if youre use FCEUX[CR]emulator.[CR] 3. If youre lucky, youll see one frame graphical glitch happen[CR]in Wily 1 boss, and First gamma.[CR] The glitch happened when theyre[CR]appearing. And moving rail too... (I guess it also from[CR]original)[CR]+++++++++++[CR]+ CONFIDE +[CR]+++++++++++[CR] Im sorry if my hack[CR]is terrible enough, because I just sharing what is in my mind and I just a[CR]n00b.[CR] Really, I dont know any ASM languages, and I just self-taught other[CR]ASM documentations. But its[CR] very, very hard to applying in the NES rom,[CR]until FCEUX come with its breakpoints feature...[CR] My hack is easy enough to[CR]deal with, and I hope the new re-modified weapons are more useful than[CR]original ones.[CR] [CR] - Why v0.99 ?[CR] This is only for bugs. If you find[CR]bugs in my hack, report me immediately. I will improve it and[CR] change the[CR]version soon.[CR] ~Enjoy...[CR]++++++++++++++[CR]+ CHANGE LOG[CR]+[CR]++++++++++++++[CR]Not really a problem... Just improve the graphic error[CR]and music, especially from Sonic The Hedgehog,[CR]and also enemy placements.[CR]+++++++++++[CR]+ CONTACT +[CR]+++++++++++[CR] [CR] 1.[CR]http://www.facebook.com/Anandastoon[CR] 2. mailto:anandastoon@gmail.com</plot>

    <plot>A full scale hack of Final Fantasy, nothing remains but the core programming[CR]routines. It features all new graphics, music, levels, enemies, text,[CR]statistics and more.

SRAM files from any versions other than 1.30 or Final will *not*[CR]work properly with this release. Sorry, too much has changed.

    <plot>Final Fantasy ++ (or Final Fantasy Double-Plus, or Final Fantasy Plus Plus) is[CR]a "re-imagining" of the very first Final Fantasy game. What's been changed: *[CR]Redone graphics. (Mostly ripped from later games in the series.) * Redone[CR]enemies. (Many are new; some are returning enemies with new properties.) *[CR]Redone magic spells. (Magic is now divided into White, Black, and Time Magic.)[CR]* Redone weapons and armor. (Some armors now increase evasion rather than[CR]lowering it!) * Redone maps. (Most are similar to the original game's; some[CR]are totally new.) * Redone character class system. (See Read Me.txt for[CR]details.) * Two new pieces of music. (Adapted from Final Fantasy 4.) * Some[CR]other relatively minor stuff. This hack has a sequel/expansion, located[CR][here](http://www.romhacking.net/hacks/113/).[CR]Read Me:[CR] Final[CR]Fantasy ++[CR] Version 1.5 (ninth release) - January 2007[CR] Hack by[CR]Grond[CR] Final Fantasy and all related indicia are copyright SquareEnix.[CR]Original English translation is copyright Nintendo.[CR] ---[CR]I.

WHAT IT IS:[CR] Final Fantasy ++ (or Final Fantasy[CR]Double-Plus, or Final Fantasy Plus Plus) is a "re-imagining" of the very[CR]first Final Fantasy game. Of course, there isnt actually any game to be found[CR]in this archive; just an IPS[CR] file that can do wonderful things when[CR]combined with a Final Fantasy 1 ROM.[CR] ---[CR]III. APPLYING THE PATCH:[CR]Youll need a utility that can apply IPS patches. Go to[CR]http://www.zophar.net/utilities/patchutil.html,[CR] download "Lunar IPS" and[CR]use it to apply the patch to a clean (unaltered) Final Fantasy 1 ROM (U.S.[CR]release).[CR] Remember to make a back-up copy of your ROM first.[CR]---[CR]IV. WHATS BEEN CHANGED:[CR] A whole lot. This is easily one of the most[CR]extensive Final Fantasy hacks released to date.[CR] -Redone graphics. (Mostly[CR]ripped from later games in the series.)[CR] -Redone enemies. (Many are new;[CR]some are returning enemies with new properties.)[CR] -Redone magic spells.[CR](Magic is now divided into White, Black, and Time Magic.)[CR] -Redone weapons[CR]and armor. (Some armors now increase evasion rather than lowering it! ^_^)[CR]-Redone maps. (Most are similar to the original games; some are totally[CR]new.)[CR] -Redone character class system (see next two sections).[CR] -Two new[CR]pieces of music. (Adapted from Final Fantasy 4.)[CR] -Some other relatively[CR]minor stuff.[CR] ---[CR]V. CLASS OVERVIEW:[CR] &gt;&gt;&gt; Fighter &lt;&lt;&lt;[CR] Hit Point[CR]growth: High (731-999 at level 50)[CR] Hit Rate growth: 2 per level (108 at[CR]level 50)[CR] Magic Defense growth: 3 per level (170 at level 50)[CR] Pros:[CR]High damage rating, highest defense, high HP[CR] Cons: Cannot learn magic[CR]&gt;&gt;&gt; Ninja &lt;&lt;&lt;[CR] Hit Point growth: Moderate (542-886 at level 50)[CR] Hit[CR]Rate growth: 3 per level (157 at level 50)[CR] Magic Defense growth: 3 per[CR]level (170 at level 50)[CR] Pros: High number of hits, highest evasion, best[CR]running ablity, some magic ability[CR] Cons: HP are a little low[CR] &gt;&gt;&gt;[CR]Moogle &lt;&lt;&lt;[CR] Hit Point growth: Very High (always 999 by level 50)[CR] Hit[CR]Rate growth: 1 per level (69 at level 50)*[CR] *note that a Moogles # of hits[CR]is double that of other classes (when no weapon is equipped).[CR] Magic[CR]Defense growth: 4 per level (200 at level 50)[CR] Pros: Good attack, can learn[CR]Temper spell, high MagDef, highest HP, high armor carrying capacity[CR] Cons:[CR]Low defense, very low MP, few equipment options[CR] &gt;&gt;&gt; Time Mage &lt;&lt;&lt;[CR] Hit[CR]Point growth: Low (379-721 at level 50)[CR] Hit Rate growth: 1 per level (52[CR]at level 50)[CR] Magic Defense growth: 4 per level (200 at level 50)[CR] Pros:[CR]Only class that can use Time magic, high MagDef, can use any magic after Class[CR]Change[CR] Cons: Lower MP growth and total MP than other mages, lowest attack[CR]and HP of all classes[CR] &gt;&gt;&gt; White Mage &lt;&lt;&lt;[CR] Hit Point growth: High[CR](666-999 at level 50)[CR] Hit Rate growth: 1 per level (56 at level 50)[CR]Magic Defense growth: 3 per level (170 at level 50)[CR] Pros:[CR]Healing/reviving/protecting/attack raising magic spells, high HP[CR] Cons:[CR]Damage-inflicting ability is somewhat lacking[CR] &gt;&gt;&gt; Black Mage &lt;&lt;&lt;[CR] Hit[CR]Point growth: Moderate (465-809 at level 50)[CR] Hit Rate growth: 1 per level[CR](59 at level 50)[CR] Magic Defense growth: 3 per level (170 at level 50)[CR]Pros: Has many options for damaging and inflicting status ailments[CR] Cons:[CR]Physical attack power and HP arent very high[CR] &gt;&gt;&gt; Sage (Time Mage upgrade)[CR]&lt;&lt;&lt;[CR] Hit Point growth: Low (379-721 at level 50)[CR] Hit Rate growth: 1 per[CR]level (52 at level 50)[CR] Magic Defense growth: 4 per level (200 at level[CR]50)[CR] Pros/Cons: see Time Mage[CR] ---[CR]VI. ABOUT CLASS CHANGE:[CR] Class[CR]Change is, for the most part, no longer just a simple upgrade, e.g. Fighter[CR]becomes Knight. Instead,[CR] it will now change fighter-type classes to mage-[CR]types, and vice-versa. Exceptions: Time Mage and Moogle.[CR] It works[CR]thusly:[CR] -Fighter becomes White Mage.[CR] -Ninja becomes Black Mage.[CR]-Moogle stays a Moogle.[CR] -Time Mage becomes Sage.[CR] -White Mage becomes[CR]Fighter.[CR] -Black Mage becomes Ninja.[CR] Know that a Class-changed[CR]character will still be able to make use of any spells learned, and any[CR]weapons[CR] and armor equipped, prior to undergoing the process. However, the[CR]change is complete; that is to say that[CR] a fighter that becomes a mage can[CR]no longer equip heavy weapons and armor, and likewise a mage that turns[CR]into a fighter can no longer learn new spells. So, you would be advised to get[CR]all the stuff you think[CR] youll be needing learned/equipped before[CR]confronting Bahamut.[CR] ---[CR]VII. KNOWN BUG(S):[CR] -When a Moogle gains a[CR]level with a claw equipped, Defense will not increase as it should.[CR] Simply[CR]visit the Armor screen and the Defense stat will update.[CR] ---[CR]VIII.[CR]VERSION HISTORY:[CR] VERSION 1.5:[CR] -Dropped the icons from the front of[CR]weapons and magic spells names, in favor of longer names.[CR] -Renamed most[CR]spells so that they more closely follow the "-ra -ga -ja" naming[CR]convention.[CR] -Changed the Soft spell entirely, plus one or two other minor[CR]changes to spells.[CR] -Gave different graphics to many weapons, and altered[CR]the properties of a couple.[CR] -Weakened and cheapened Potions to 50 HP for[CR]50 gil.[CR] -Tweaked the Earth Cave music slightly.[CR] -Made very minor[CR]changes to some NPCs dialogues.[CR] -Renamed some things that were otherwise[CR]unchanged.[CR] -Recolored a couple of things.[CR] -Some other changes of[CR]relatively little consequence.[CR] VERSION 1.45:[CR] -Eliminated screen[CR](un)furling effect when changing areas.[CR] -Added support for 10-character[CR]enemy names.[CR] -Changed a few enemies names.[CR] -Made Pirate enemy a little[CR]easier to kill.[CR] -Some minor palette changes; included a .pal file.[CR]Minor updates:[CR] -Changed the worthless Basna spell to Blind.[CR] -Subtle[CR]changes to the .pal file.[CR] VERSION 1.41:[CR] -Added Dischs flowing-ocean[CR]hack and used Dormentos method to disable the B-Select map.[CR] VERSION[CR]1.4:[CR] -Eliminated the Poison status affliction and reinstated the Darkness[CR]status instead.[CR] -Pure spell changed to Basna (i.e. "Battle Esuna").

    <plot>This is a semi-sequel (or more like an expansion pack) for the author's[CR]previous hack, [Final Fantasy ++](http://www.romhacking.net/hacks/81/)^ (so if[CR]you haven't played that, then you probably shouldn't be playing this). At any[CR]rate, this is quite a bit harder to beat than FF++, so n00bs beware. Also, one[CR]can consider this sort of a tribute to classic SquareEnix (the way they[CR]were...). It includes adaptations of various dungeons from FFs 3, 4, 5, and 6,[CR]SaGa 2 (a.k.a. FF Legend 2), and Dragon Quest 5 (along with a couple of new[CR]ones). And, of course, lots of classic FF enemies are here for you to battle.[CR]^There is a patch available to combine both these hacks into a single ROM[CR]located [here.](http://www.romhacking.net/hacks/1584/)[CR]Read[CR]Me:[CR]Final Fantasy ++ World of Chaos[CR]Version 1.2 (third release) -[CR]January 2007[CR]Hack by Grond[CR]Final Fantasy and all related indicia are[CR]copyright SquareEnix.[CR]Introduction[CR]------------[CR]This is a semi-sequel[CR](or more like an expansion pack) for my previous[CR]hack, Final Fantasy ++ (so[CR]if you havent played that, then you really[CR]shouldnt be playing this). At[CR]any rate, this is quite a bit harder to[CR]beat than FF++, so n00bs beware.[CR]Also, one can consider this sort of a[CR]tribute to classic SquareEnix (the[CR]way they were...). It includes adap-[CR]tations of various dungeons from FFs[CR]3, 4, 5, and 6, SaGa 2 (a.k.a. FF[CR]Legend 2), and Dragon Quest 5 (along with[CR]a couple of new ones by me).[CR]And, of course, lots of classic FF enemies are[CR]here for you to battle.[CR]Instructions[CR]------------[CR]Patch your clean[CR](unaltered) FF1 US ROM and rename it to "FF++WoC.nes".[CR]Make a copy of your[CR]at-or-near endgame save (.sav) file from FF++ 1.5,[CR]rename it to[CR]"FF++WoC.sav", and place this file in the proper direc-[CR]tory (varies by[CR]emulator, some use a special folder for .sav files,[CR]with others just make[CR]sure the .sav is in the same folder as the rom).[CR]Failing that, you can use[CR]one of the supplied "pre-fab" saves or just[CR]start a new game (see next[CR]section).[CR]***Note: Try to ensure that your FF++ game is saved at a town[CR](Coneria[CR] is ideal). If youve saved at some random place on the world[CR]map,[CR] you or your airship may end up stuck in the ocean or on a[CR]mountain.[CR] Alternatively, just use a Sleeping Bag or Tent while in the[CR]airship.[CR]Starting a New Game[CR]-------------------[CR](Feel free to skip[CR]this section if importing a FF++ save.)[CR]This method of playing is not[CR]really recommended, but it is definitely[CR]do-able. Ill give a few pointers[CR]to make things go more smoothly (some[CR]of this applies to using the pre-fab[CR]saves as well, just not the level-[CR]building). You will start on the[CR]northeastern-most island-continent in[CR]front of a town. Head into the town,[CR]enter the storage building on the[CR]east edge of town and take the stuff from[CR]the chests. Now buy whatever[CR]weapons and armor you think youll need from[CR]the shops and equip them.[CR]Stop by the Inn and Save your game. Now leave[CR]town by the south exit,[CR]and head directly south until you board the ship.[CR]Now sail south just[CR]a bit and then east, until you round the "horn" at the[CR]east end of the[CR]continent, and then sail directly north. Youll get into a[CR]battle, but[CR]just run away. Dont worry if some characters get killed, thats[CR]going[CR]to be happening a lot ;) Continue due north until you see land.[CR]Park[CR]the ship here, and walk to the desert nearby to claim the airship.[CR]Now[CR]you can go anywhere, but youre too weak until youve gained lots[CR]of[CR]levels. You should probably go ahead and Save again (just use a[CR]Sleep-[CR]ing Bag). Fly north about one screen and then west until you reach[CR]a[CR]small island. The weakest enemies in the game are located here.[CR]Fight[CR]these until you reach about level 10 or so. As you gain MP, you[CR]will[CR]eventually want to buy spells. From this island, head north and[CR]ever-[CR]so-slightly west until you reach the place where Coneria used to[CR]be.[CR]Every spell in the game can be bought here. Anyway, once your guys[CR]are[CR]a bit stronger, you can try fighting tougher enemies; I recommend[CR]fight-[CR]ing river monsters now until youre about level 20. You can[CR]probably[CR]figure the rest out on your own, so here ends the wall-of-text[CR];)[CR]"Unsafe Items" List[CR]-------------------[CR]In order to create new[CR]weapons and armors for WoC, I had to replace[CR]many of the old, weak items[CR]from FF++. Also, because of the way that[CR]FF1s equipment system works, you[CR]can seriously screw up your stats[CR]if you have any of these items equipped[CR]when you import a FF++ save[CR]into WoC. So then, you should ensure that none[CR]of these items are in[CR]your characters inventory if you wish to play the[CR]hack legitimately.[CR]UNSAFE[CR]WEAPONS:[CR]--------------[CR]Falchion[CR]Scimitar[CR]Claymore[CR]HandAxe[CR]DwarfAxe[CR]Javelin[CR]Partisan[CR]Hammer[CR]Dagger[CR]Orichalcum[CR]Kunai[CR]Ashura[CR]Kotetsu[CR]Rod[CR]Staff[CR]UNSAFE[CR]ARMORS:[CR]-------------[CR]Leather armor[CR]Bronze armor[CR]Cloth[CR]vest[CR]Leather vest[CR]Linen robe[CR]Silk robe[CR]Wizard robe[CR]Leather[CR]helm[CR]Bronze helm[CR]Leather hat[CR]Leather shield[CR]Bronze[CR]shield[CR]Rubber mantle[CR]Red mantle[CR]Whats new in[CR]1.2?[CR]------------------[CR]-Dropped the icons from the front of weapons[CR]and[CR] magic spells names, in favor of longer names.[CR]-Renamed most spells[CR]so that they more closely[CR] follow the "-ra -ga -ja" naming[CR]convention.[CR]-Changed the Soft spell entirely, plus one[CR] or two other[CR]minor changes to spells.[CR]-Gave different graphics to many weapons,[CR] and[CR]altered the properties of several.[CR]-Altered some enemies stats for balance[CR]reasons.[CR]-Gave new graphics to a couple of enemies.[CR]-Changed Necromancr[CR]enemy to Prototype.[CR]-Worm enemy gives much more Exp., to help those[CR] of[CR]you starting a New Game to level up quicker.[CR]-Made running from battle more[CR]difficult.[CR]-One new piece of music inserted.[CR]-Renamed some things that[CR]were otherwise unchanged.[CR]-Recolored a couple of things.[CR]-Some other[CR]changes of relatively little consequence.[CR]What was new in[CR]1.1[CR]-------------------[CR]-Eliminated screen (un)furling effect when[CR]changing areas.[CR]-Added support for 10-character enemy names.[CR]-Un-[CR]squashed enemy names where possible.[CR]-Changed a few enemies[CR]names.[CR]-Powered-up the Murmasa, Kusanagi, and Scorp tail.[CR]-Changed Mazin[CR]enemy to Haniwa.[CR]-Made T-Rex enemy more deadly.[CR]-Some other minor[CR]changes...[CR]Minor updates:[CR]-Changed the worthless Basna spell to[CR]Blind.[CR]-Made the final boss resistant to Mute.[CR]-Made Raiden enemy a bit[CR]harder to kill.[CR]-Subtle changes to the .pal file.[CR]Legal[CR]-----[CR]This[CR]archive and its contents are offered freely and "as-is".

    <plot>This is a very comprehensive redesign of Final Fantasy 1. In addition to the[CR]weapon, armor, monster, spell, and job data being rebuilt from the ground up,[CR]you can now select from among 12 jobs at the beginning rather than only 6.[CR]Weapons and armor now have types, and jobs equip items by type rather than by[CR]individual weapons or armors (e.g. if you can use one staff you can use them[CR]all). Each spell now has two colors rather than just one. A spell can be Black[CR]or White, and in addition can be Red or Time. Black spells are offensive,[CR]White defensive; Red spells are direct, Time indirect. Thus a spell like CURE[CR]would be White Red, while LOCK would be Black Time. Some of the maps are[CR]largely the same but there are a few differences. However, many maps are[CR]completely new altogether. Many bug-fixes and improvements have been applied;[CR]too many to list, but among them are the martial arts bug, the house bug,[CR]faster text boxes, 5-letter character names, unbroken spell routines (e.g.[CR]"attack up"), and weapon elements. Version 2 fixes most, if not all, of the[CR]graphical oddities present in version 1. It also adds a few more features,[CR]including a random(ish) default party, both directional buttons working on the[CR]character selection screen (so if you "missed" the job you wanted you don't[CR]have to cycle back around through 11 jobs), the clinics are free now and heal[CR]everything (not just KO), as well as a variety of other miscellaneous minor[CR]fixes and improvements. Also of note, even in version 1, there is/was no[CR]waterfall dungeon, and it is not required to complete the game.</plot>

INTRODUCTION[CR]Final Fantasy Restored is a tribute to the[CR]original Final Fantasy, refashioning the game into[CR]what it was intended to[CR]be when it was first created. Most prominently, it is a compilation[CR]of[CR]every known bug fix in the game. This amounts to at least 50 or so bug fixes,[CR]and materialy[CR]changes the way that the game plays. I am only responsible[CR]for a couple of these fixes, none[CR]of which have much of an impact on the[CR]game. I have, where known, noted who is responsible for[CR]which patch in the[CR]"Credits" section. First and foremost, the trio of anomie, Paulygon,[CR]and[CR]Alex Jackson should be mentioned, who were the ones to fix most of the[CR]core bugs in the game.[CR]Disch (of FFHackster fame) and Grond also provided a[CR]couple fixes. In addition to fixing bugs,[CR]it also restores the original[CR]graphics that were censored in the North American version.[CR]It is also a[CR]retranslation (of sorts) of the original Japanese text. I have wherever[CR]possible[CR]tried to preserve the terminology in the Japanese version, and[CR]when that was impractical, used[CR]terms from subsequent official[CR]translations. Gronds Strings Expansion patch was essential in[CR]implementing[CR]proper terminology and item/spell/enemy names. This patch expands the[CR]maximum[CR]usable characters to a reasonable level.[CR]The translation of the[CR]script is based on x_lotos fan translation, cross-referenced with[CR]Final[CR]Fantasy: Origins and Final Fantasy: Dawn of Souls. Where possible, I have[CR]tried to[CR]preserve the original meaning while giving the text a more natural[CR]feel. Lenophis DTE Fixer[CR]Upper was key in fitting most of the script into[CR]Final Fantasy Restored.[CR]This patch also incorporates several enhancements[CR]not intended in the original game. With the[CR]exception of the Improved RNG[CR]patch (replaces the awful RNG the game was made with and makes[CR]the game[CR]more random), which is optional, _these do not affect gameplay in any[CR]substantive[CR]way_. They are purely cosmetic or convenience-based, such as[CR]the Buy-10 option or the Dash[CR]Button. These enhancements also include new[CR]music by LeviathanMist, originally composed for[CR]the Final Fantasy[CR]Rebalanced project. Please note that some of this music requires applying[CR]an[CR]optional patch to access.[CR]Its noteworthy that no official release of[CR]Final Fantasy fixes every bug. Even FF: Origins[CR]does not fix the Critical[CR]Hit Bug or the Intelligence Bug, which are the two biggest bugs in[CR]the[CR]game. This will provide you with the most authentic Final Fantasy experience[CR]possible, as[CR]it was designed to be, unencumbered by bugs, censorship, or[CR]text data limitations. It is my[CR]hope that you find it enjoyable.[CR]II. BUG[CR]FIXES[CR]See the Bug Fixes and Enhancements sticky on the Final Fantasy[CR]Gamefaqs board if you want[CR]more information on these bugs. All of the bugs[CR]mentioned below are fixed.[CR]* The airship can land on the caravan.[CR]*[CR]House saves before restoring MP. Also, correct message to reflect the[CR]fix.[CR]* Monk Armor bug, it looks at whether a weapon is equipped instead of[CR]checking armor.[CR]* Running looks in the in-battle data instead of the[CR]permanent data.[CR]* Weapon category/element attack values are never[CR]loaded.[CR]* Weapon index is used for critical value.[CR]* Enemies use their[CR]category/element as a category/element attack, and the warriors[CR]category/element attack as the category/element to attack.[CR]* Weapon[CR]elemental attack is used as elemental weakness when magic is cast.[CR]* The[CR]player class is used as the creature type when magic is cast. Fortunately,[CR]only Dia[CR] uses it and no class has bit 4 set.[CR]* Target-dark and evade[CR]should not be applied when the target is asleep/stopped.[CR]* Hit% should be[CR]applied even if asleep.[CR]* Hit chance should not clamped until after evade[CR]is subtracted.[CR]* Status attacks are attempted on misses after the first[CR]successful hit[CR]* Enemies always wake from sleep.[CR]* Enemy-cast all-allies[CR]spells (e.g. BarFire) dont hit the caster.[CR]* Poison doesnt work on[CR]enemies.[CR]* After battle, your warriors might be sorted incorrectly[CR]*[CR]Mute status prevents Drink as well as Magic and Item.[CR]* If you gain enough[CR]experience for 2 levels at once, you only get one at the time (you get[CR] the[CR]second after the next battle) and the "for next level" number on the status[CR]screen is[CR] wrong.[CR]* If you enter a map (by teleporting, exiting a shop,[CR]or exiting a menu) in the top/left 7[CR] rows/columns, sprites will walk[CR]through you until you step verically/horizontally.[CR]* In the 2-large-6-small[CR]enemy formation, the game shifts one too far so the third enemy[CR] uses the[CR]palette selection bit for the second enemy.[CR]* Healara effectivity should be[CR]0x18.[CR]* Focara should use effect 0E instead of 10.[CR]* Focus (and fixed[CR]Focara) always misses.[CR]* Temper should probably be using effect 0B instead[CR]of 0D.[CR]* For warrior targets, Attack and Accuracy are never loaded/saved[CR]for use by magic. Thus,[CR] Temper and Saber.[CR]* Defense for enemy targets[CR]is loaded from ROM instead of RAM for magic, making Protect not[CR] work.[CR]*[CR]For enemy targets, Hit% is never loaded/saved for use by magic.[CR]* Enemy[CR]elemental resistance is not stored in the in-RAM data, so spells like BarFire[CR]and[CR] Dispel dont work.[CR]* Several caster bytes are loaded for magic, with[CR]wrong values. But none are actually used.[CR]* Spells causing multiple status[CR]ailments will claim "Ineffective" if the target has any of[CR] the ailments[CR](all will still be applied though).[CR]* Int is never used. It should probably[CR]be added to spell accuracy.[CR]* Healing spells should also probably use INT[CR]in some way.[CR]* Random encounters on the overworld are actually determined[CR]by the domain region you were[CR] in when you entered the world map or at the[CR]end of your last battle on it.[CR]* There are several domain mapping errors,[CR]most famously on the tip of the Peninsula[CR] Northeast of Pravoka. Some of[CR]these are as simple as adding battle data to void domain[CR] regions, but[CR]others like the PNEOP will require some subtle geographic tweaks.[CR]* If you[CR]stand on a door, enter a menu, exit the menu, then step down, the door will[CR]usually[CR] end up elsewhere on the screen. (NOTE: This fix only partially[CR]solves the problem).[CR]* There are a number of sprites that start out in non-[CR]walkable areas. Sometimes, they can[CR] even end up outside the bounds of the[CR]dungeons.[CR]* The Fire and Wind alters say "Nothing here" instead of their[CR]proper message.[CR]* One of the Sages has his second message obscured by[CR]incomplete criteria. An old man in[CR] Onrac uses Wind Crystal lit as a[CR]condition for dialogue when the criterion should[CR] logically be the Water[CR]Crystal. The Spring in Gaia uses regular water tiles instead of the[CR]special tiles with the Spring text message.[CR]* The game has two canoes, one[CR]that is usable and one that shows in the item list. This[CR] combines the[CR]two.[CR]* Ribbons name has an extra space.[CR]* Enemy skills do not display[CR]the messages they are programmed to.[CR]* Dead characters probably shouldnt be[CR]trying to recover from Sleep or Paralysis.[CR]* Out of battle spells do not[CR]have their ID numbers calculated properly[CR]* If a player is in a room and an[CR]object is out of a room, the object is not updated. This[CR] prevents you from[CR]being able to shove an NPC out of the way if theyre blocking the exit[CR] of a[CR]door.[CR]* The existing turn-order algorithm is not particularly good, and may[CR]actually be unfair.[CR]* The Temple of Chaos past tileset has a warp tile with[CR]identical graphics to the [CR] teleport tile to the past in the Temple of[CR]Chaos present. The fact that a tile was [CR] apparently programmed and some of[CR]the remakes place one there along with the[CR] conceptual idea that it makes[CR]sense for the time gate to be open on both sides[CR] suggests the lack of a[CR]warp back may be a bug.[CR]* Red Mages gain a L1 spell charge on level 22[CR]right after gaining one at level 21[CR] (inconsistent with their pattern) and[CR]then again at level 35 (consistent with their[CR] pattern), making them the[CR]only class to gain ten charges of any spell level (though[CR] the game caps[CR]them at 9). The gain at L22 is probably a bug. [CR]* Several Magic Defense[CR](Magic Evasion) growth values are strange and possibly bugged. Two[CR] options[CR]are available: one that inverts Magic Defense values so they make more sense[CR]in[CR] context of initial values and game structure (default), and one that[CR]simply swaps[CR] the Monk and Master growth values for a more conservative[CR]fix.[CR]* The Mythril Sword is very out of place in Elfheim. Some remakes[CR]replace this with the[CR] Longsword.[CR]B. Enhancements[CR]* Credits for much[CR]of this work noted in the Bridge Screen.[CR]* The New Game/Continue screen is[CR]so boring. Why not have a real Title Screen?[CR]* Magic Defense (retermed[CR]"M.Evasion" based on function) is shown on the status screen.[CR]* Walk faster[CR]while holding the "B" button[CR]* Default Battle Speed is higher[CR]* Add a[CR]"Buy 10" option to the item shop menu[CR]* Item screen is rearranged so that[CR]consumable items are on top and Potions come first.[CR]* Confused enemies use[CR]something resembling an attack rather than Fire on each other.[CR]* Warp and[CR]Exit now have a confirmation step before teleporting you.[CR]* Rearranging[CR]poisoned characters after battle is annoying. They are no longer sorted.[CR]*[CR]You can now see what is in a chest even if your inventory is full.[CR]* DTE[CR]Table has been slightly expanded, and is now usable anywhere.[CR]* String[CR]length has been greatly expanded, allowing for better names.[CR]* The crappy[CR]PRNG can optionally be replaced with a better one.[CR]* Boss HP can optionally[CR]be doubled.[CR]C. INT Patch Configuration[CR]I have implemented a modified[CR]version of anomies INT patch. Generally, I have tried to use[CR]the most[CR]conservative reasonable configuration possible without all the bells and[CR]whistles I[CR]added to Final Fantasy Rebalanced. In part, this involved[CR]changing the healing routine.[CR]anomie initially added a component to make[CR]healing spells double, much like damaging spells.[CR]I have changed this so[CR]that INT instead affects your chance for a higher healing value within[CR]the[CR]normal predetermined range. Magic cast through items do not utilize[CR]intelligence, mostly[CR]for balancing reasons. I also included anomies[CR]modification whereby confused enemies[CR]essentially use an unmissable single-[CR]hit regular attack on each other, as opposed to the Fire[CR]spell (which never[CR]made much sense).[CR]The new functions are:[CR]*Items do not utilize[CR]INT[CR]*Add INT to chance-to-hit for status spells[CR]*Add INT to chance-to-[CR]double for damage spells[CR]*INT increases average healing[CR]---For Cure,[CR]Heal, and Healara: Healed amount is Effectivty +[CR](INT/4)...Effectivity[CR]---For Cura and Healaga: Healed amount is Effectivity[CR]+ (INT/2)...Effectivity[CR]---For Curaga: Healed amount is Effectivity +[CR]INT...Effectivity[CR]So,[CR]Cure Cura Curaga Heal Healara Healaga[CR] 0 INT:[CR]16...32 32...64 64...128 12...24 24...48 48...96 [CR] 8 INT: 18...32 36...64[CR]72...128 14...24 26...48 52...96[CR]16 INT: 20...32 40...64 80...128 16...24[CR]28...48 56...96[CR]24 INT: 22...32 44...64 88...128 18...24 30...48[CR]60...96[CR]32 INT: 24...32 48...64 96...128 20...24 32...48 64...96[CR]40 INT:[CR]26...32 52...64 104...128 22...24 34...48 68...96[CR]48 INT: 28...32 56...64[CR]112...128 24 36...48 72...96[CR]56 INT: 30...32 60...64 120...128 24 38...48[CR]76...96[CR]64 INT: 32 64 128 24 40...48 80...96[CR]III. SETTINGS[CR]You may[CR]have noticed a sub-folder containing several other patches in it. These allow[CR]you to[CR]change certain settings in the main patch by applying them _over_[CR]the main patch. That is, you[CR]_first_ apply the main patch, and _then_ apply[CR]any settings you want. Note that if you are[CR]happy with the defaults listed[CR]below, _you do not need to apply any of these patches_. The[CR]process is[CR]fairly self-explanatory, and any of these can be changed at any time no need[CR]to[CR]start a new game (you do however have to apply them _before_ you load[CR]the game in order for[CR]them to take effect). Unfortunately, this process is[CR]necessary because theres just no way to[CR]make an in-game Configuration menu[CR]to accomplish this.[CR]A. Menu Color[CR]Thanks to Gronds identification of the[CR]right byte for this, it is possible to change the[CR]battle menu windows to a[CR]color other than black and remove the border around the battlefield.[CR]These[CR]patches will also change all other game menus and dialogue boxes to a matching[CR]color.[CR]The default is black battle menus with a border around the[CR]battlefield.[CR]*Basic Black (Default)[CR]*Standard[CR]Blue[CR]*Red[CR]*Green[CR]*Purple[CR]B. Battle Speed[CR]Formerly known as[CR]Respond Rate, this affects how quickly the text in battles goes by.[CR]This[CR]option allows you to change the default Battle Speed on the Title[CR]Screen. Four settings are[CR]provided:[CR]*Battle Speed 5[CR]*Battle Speed 6[CR](Default)[CR]*Battle Speed 7[CR]*Battle Speed 8[CR]C. Magic Defense[CR]The[CR]Magic Defense Growth Rate bug is problematic in the sense that, while its[CR]clear theres[CR]something wrong, its not entirely clear what these values were[CR]supposed to be. The Monk has a[CR]growth rate of 4, while the Master has a[CR]rate of 1. Should these be swapped? Should both be 4?[CR]Should both be 1?[CR]This is unclear. Additionally, the growth rates for the Fighter, Red[CR]Mage,[CR]White Mage, and Black Mage are dissonent with their initial starting[CR]values and dont make sense[CR]conceptually or practically.[CR]I have proposed[CR]the solution of inverting growth rates for all classes except the Thief,[CR]which[CR]produces a rather elegant solution by correlating growth rates to[CR]initial values, with a booster[CR]for the Master (who gains nothing else from[CR]class change). I have also included an optional[CR]patch that features a more[CR]conservative solution by only swapping the values that are[CR]definitely[CR]bugged (MK/MA) but not those only probably bugged (FI/RM/WM/BM).[CR]For comparison[CR]Original *MK/MA Inversion *All Inversion[CR](Default)[CR]Initial (Growth) Initial (Growth) Initial (Growth)[CR]MK - 10[CR](+4) MK - 10 (+1) MK - 10 (+1)[CR]MA (+1) MA (+4) MA (+4)[CR]FI - 15 (+3) FI -[CR]15 (+3) FI - 15 (+2)[CR]TH - 15 (+2) TH - 15 (+2) TH - 15 (+2)[CR]RM - 20 (+2)[CR]RM - 20 (+2) RM - 20 (+3)[CR]WM - 20 (+2) WM - 20 (+2) WM - 20 (+3)[CR]BM - 20[CR](+2) BM - 20 (+2) BM - 20 (+3)[CR]D. Random Number Generator[CR]The game has a[CR]very poor random number generator that makes encounters precisely predictable,[CR]as[CR]well as the number of steps required to initiate one (allowing for[CR]extensive manipulation). This[CR]also makes things like paraplinking cycles,[CR]where the exact same circumstances play out each[CR]round of battle, more[CR]likely. This is not so much a bug as a design flaw, so by default[CR]the[CR]original RNG is used.[CR]However, anomie created an improved RNG that[CR]makes many aspects of the game more random. Battles[CR]still have the same[CR]relative prevalence (e.g., rare encounters are still rare), but do[CR]not[CR]proceed in a predetermined list. The steps to get into a battle are[CR]variable as well (but within[CR]the same general range as before). Events in[CR]battle also tend to be a little more "random". From[CR]my experience, this[CR]improves the game noticeably and I recommend using it. However, from a[CR]purist[CR]perspective, I have not made it the default setting.[CR]*Original[CR](Default)[CR]*Improved[CR]E. Boss HP[CR]Final Fantasy Origins doubled boss HP.[CR]This is not a bug fix, just a change from the most faithful[CR]official remake[CR]I thought worthwhile to have as an option. This doubles the HP of Garland,[CR]the[CR]Pirates, Astos, Lich (2), Marilith (2), Kraken (2), Tiamat (2), and[CR]Chaos.[CR]*Original (Default)[CR]*Doubled[CR]F. Music[CR]LeviathanMist has[CR]kindly composed additional music for use in this project. Three new tracks[CR]are[CR]available - a boss theme, a fiend theme, and a final boss theme - and[CR]the Prelude has been updated[CR]to contain a component added in later Final[CR]Fantasies. Unfortunately, due to space constraints, it[CR]was only possible to[CR]fit the regular boss theme into the space available. However, the other[CR]two[CR]boss themes may be incorporated along with the first by cannibalizing[CR]the data for the Ship Game.[CR]By default, all bosses in the game utilize the[CR]regular boss theme. Applying the patch to add in new[CR]music by removing the[CR]Ship Game will incorporate separate boss themes for the Fiends and for[CR]the[CR]final boss.[CR]*Remove New Boss Music + Add Ship Game[CR](Default)[CR]*Remove Ship Game + Add New Boss Music[CR]Also note that for[CR]purists who do not wish to experience any music not present in the original,[CR]all[CR]of it may be removed (including the changes to the Prelude).[CR]*New[CR]Music On (Default)[CR]*New Music Off[CR]IV. RETRANSLATION[CR]A.[CR]Generally[CR]In creating a new localization, I have tried to be as true to the[CR]original Japanese as possible,[CR]while giving things a more natural feel.[CR]While I made some stylistic exceptions in Final Fantasy[CR]Rebalanced, I kept[CR]the original text whenever possible here, so long as it didnt sound[CR]unnatural[CR](some examples are "Cloud" for BANE and "Shape" for LOCK. These[CR]were rendered "Scourge" and "Focus"[CR]based on subsequent localizations). A[CR]part of this includes using the -ra/-ga/-ja convention of[CR]spell tiers. This[CR]is not merely the modern standard, but also how the original game was written.[CR]As[CR]such, I have adhered to this over the numbering used in the original[CR]Final Fantasy localizations[CR]until FFVIII.[CR]The script was difficult to[CR]properly capture - all the more so because, unlike Final[CR]Fantasy[CR]Rebalanced, the lack of a full DTE expansion gave me much less room[CR]to work with. I have tried to[CR]keep close to the original substance.[CR]Unfortunately, I do not myself speak Japanese. My method was[CR]to use x_lotos[CR]Japanese Fan translation as a primary source - though it is a very literal[CR]and[CR]unrefined translation. In addition to this, I cross-referenced this[CR]script with the scripts in[CR]FF: Origins and FF: Dawn of Souls to aid at[CR]deciphering the intended meaning (while the Famicom[CR]script helped me avoid[CR]content added in subsequent remakes). The story is of course not[CR]exactly[CR]high art in terms of literature, but was reasonably impressive for[CR]a video game in 1987. It has[CR]been reproduced as it was then here, as best[CR]as possible.[CR]B. Names and Terminology[CR]Gronds strings patch allows for[CR]the following expansions:[CR]+Player names up to 6 characters[CR]+Class names[CR]up to 10 characters[CR]+Spell names up to 8 characters[CR]+Equipment names up[CR]to 10 characters[CR]+Story Item names up to 13 characters[CR]+Usable Item[CR]names up to 10 characters[CR]+Enemy names up to 15 characters[CR]+Enemy Attack[CR]names up to 11 characters[CR]+Status Ailments up to 6 characters[CR]+Battle[CR]Messages up to 28 characters[CR]+Shop names up to 11 characters[CR]Please see[CR]the "Textual Changes" text document for a list of changes from the original[CR]North American[CR]localization.[CR]V.

Please note that Final Fantasy Restored is[CR]only[CR]provided as a patch in .ips form, and assumes that you own a copy of[CR]the original Final Fantasy.[CR]VII. WHAT IS FINAL FANTASY REBALANCED?[CR]Final[CR]Fantasy Rebalanced is a project I began in December 2007 on the 20th[CR]Anniversary of Final[CR]Fantasy. Final Fantasy Restored branched off as a side[CR]project from this and benefited from the[CR]work Id done on the retranslation.[CR]Its purpose is to both implement everything found in Final[CR]Fantasy[CR]Restored, as well as go further and rebalance the game. Fixing all the bugs[CR]may improve[CR]the gameplay experience, but many things are still poorly[CR]balanced. Final Fantasy Rebalanced[CR]addresses this, while also adding many[CR]enhancements and a little new content while still staying[CR]true to the core[CR]content and spirit of the original game. Key features are:[CR]**Classes have[CR]been adjusted so that they are more balanced with each other[CR]**Weapons,[CR]armor, and spells have been tweaked to be more useful/powerful.[CR]**A few[CR]useless spells have been deleted, replaced by more useful ones inspired by[CR]traditional[CR] FF spells.[CR]**Added spiked squares make some powerful items[CR]more difficult to obtain, and a few item[CR] placements have altered[CR]slightly.[CR]**Boosted stats on bosses and some enemies.[CR]**Some enemy[CR]formations have been adjusted in some ways.[CR]**Various Spiked Squares have[CR]been added to guard some valuable treasures.[CR]**Many duplicate chests have[CR]been removed and replaced with unique ones.[CR]**A few chest locations have[CR]changed[CR]**Graphics have been reverted back to the original Japanese version[CR](with a couple tweaks).[CR]**Several optional settings, allowing you to[CR]customize certain features to your liking[CR]**Many other changes and new[CR]features[CR]This project has undergone thorough testing by dozens of testers[CR]and continuous revision over the[CR]last two and a half years. The main game[CR]is essentially finished at this point, and as now, I am[CR]trying to finish[CR]the final tweaks.</plot>

    <plot>It's finally done! After 4 years of work, here it is. This hack changes just[CR]about every aspect of this game and makes it a much more enjoyable experience,[CR]and resemble the original PS1 version more accurately. Music, graphics,[CR]gameplay...There's just too much to list here! For a list of all changes to[CR]the game, have a look at the Readme file. * For Xbox emulator users, use[CR]NestopiaX V1.4 or higher. MednafenX-NES does not support the mapper which this[CR]ROM uses and will not run at all. New in 1.1: * Bug fixes to optional bosses[CR]and a few items. * Item descriptions have been redone. * Damage sprite added[CR]to battle system. * Issue of compatibility with Nestopia has been fixed.[CR]Enjoy! :)[CR]Read[CR]Me:[CR]################################################################################[CR]#[CR]F I N A L F A N T A S Y V I I A D V E N T C H I L D R E N P A T C H #[CR]#[CR]----------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]#[CR]################################################################################[CR]FINAL[CR]FANTASY VII ADVENT CHILDREN V1.1[CR]BY LUGIA2009[CR]Date 11/10/2013[CR]1.[CR]About FFVII Advent Children[CR]2.

About This[CR]Hack#[CR]####################[CR]This is a complete overhaul of Shenzhen[CR]Nanjings game.[CR]First Ill go into the changes made during the original FFVII[CR]Upgrade Project by the super awesome Lindblum back in 2008.[CR]From the[CR]original version, Lindblum translated all dialog, character names, enemy[CR]names, equipment names, item names, item descriptions, menu text, and battle[CR]text. Now some things did have to be abbreviated due to size constraints. The[CR]font was improved, the game was rebalanced make the game faster and easier.[CR]And spell graphics were changed. [CR]Along with these changes Lindblum also[CR]made these changes: [CR]Made it possible for the character to run by holding B[CR]while moving.[CR]While riding a chocobo, the chocobo music will play.[CR]He[CR]made the songs "Those chosen by the planet" and "Ahead on our Way" that are[CR]used in this game.[CR]***And best of all, Lindblum created a weapon shop that[CR]you can use to purchase weapons![CR]Then Tsumai hacked the music engine to[CR]allow looping and branching to save space when making custom music. and Tsumai[CR]also created the standard battle music and the "Prelude" song for this game.[CR]Dr. Mario for creating the enemy sprites for Soldier, Guard Scorpion, Air[CR]Buster, Safer Sephiroth, and "Bizaro Sephiroth. He also created many of the[CR]mugshots used in this game.[CR]----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Now[CR]Ill go into the changes made for the current project and thank those who have[CR]made contributions or this project.

About This[CR]Hack#[CR]####################[CR]This is a complete overhaul of Shenzhen[CR]Nanjings game.[CR]First Ill go into the changes made during the original FFVII[CR]Upgrade Project by the super awesome Lindblum back in 2008.[CR]From the[CR]original version, Lindblum translated all dialog, character names, enemy[CR]names, equipment names, item names, item descriptions, menu text, and battle[CR]text. Now some things did have to be abbreviated due to size constraints. The[CR]font was improved, the game was rebalanced make the game faster and easier.[CR]And spell graphics were changed. [CR]Along with these changes Lindblum also[CR]made these changes: [CR]Made it possible for the character to run by holding B[CR]while moving.[CR]While riding a chocobo, the chocobo music will play.[CR]He[CR]made the songs "Those chosen by the planet" and "Ahead on our Way" that are[CR]used in this game.[CR]***And best of all, Lindblum created a weapon shop that[CR]you can use to purchase weapons![CR]Then Tsumai hacked the music engine to[CR]allow looping and branching to save space when making custom music. and Tsumai[CR]also created the standard battle music and the "Prelude" song for this game.[CR]Dr. Mario for creating the enemy sprites for Soldier, Guard Scorpion, Air[CR]Buster, Safer Sephiroth, and "Bizaro Sephiroth. He also created many of the[CR]mugshots used in this game.[CR]----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Now[CR]Ill go into the changes made for the current project and thank those who have[CR]made contributions or this project.

    <plot>Final Fantasy Zz is a much more difficult version of Final Fantasy with a few[CR]enhancements designed to make the game more enjoyable and much more[CR]challenging. While Final Fantasy Zz is largely true to the original Final[CR]Fantasy, this hack contains multiple bugfixes, such as fixing the critical hit[CR]bug, the Black Belt armor bug, and some cosmetic bugs. There are also some[CR]improvements, such as the ability to buy 9 Heal Potions at a time, the ability[CR]to see what's in a treasure chest without taking the item if your inventory is[CR]full, new magic spells, a slightly redesigned map, rebalanced classes, a few[CR]new monsters, and the ability to dash by holding the B-button. Many enemies[CR]have altered stats and some have new special attacks. For those of you who[CR]have beaten Final Fantasy 1, this hack should help spice up an old favorite[CR]and keep you on the edge of your seat! You won't ever want to play the[CR]original Final Fantasy again after giving FFZz a try! UPDATE (DECEMBER 2016)[CR]a. Enemy changes: Made some slight changes to some enemy stats, enemy AI,[CR]enemy names, enemy locations, and battle formations. Agamas in particular are[CR]more reasonable. Cetus is somewhat more difficult. Slightly lowered the absorb[CR]of some late-game bosses. The advanced Fang/Medusa encounter in the Volcano[CR]has been removed. b. Treasure changes: Added two more Atlas Gauntlets and[CR]improved the treasures in the Ice Cave and a few other areas. c. Magic and[CR]equipment changes: Replaced the Holy Sword with the Holy Mace, which can only[CR]be equipped by the RM and RW. The RM/RW can now equip the Iron Gauntlet. The[CR]Red Shield can now cast CALM when used as an item in battle. The Rogue Knife[CR]can now cast LOCK when used as an item in battle. The Shadow Armor now resists[CR]fire in addition to status magic. The Atlas Gauntlet now protects against[CR]poison in addition to earth, which should make this armor quite useful for[CR]Fighters and Black Belts in the Earth Cave and Gurgu Volcano. Increased the[CR]prices of a few items and pieces of equipment. Increased the power of POWR[CR]from +28 to +32. d. Readme fixes: Corrected the Aegis Shield entry to show[CR]that it can cast XBAR as an item in battle. Corrected the QAKE entry to show[CR]that it can only be learned by the BM and BW. e. Character changes: The RM/RW[CR]has been significantly improved. The RW can now learn HEL3 and BANE. The RM[CR]can now learn BOMB, but he can no longer learn ESNA until after the class[CR]change. The availability of the Holy Mace gives the RM a very good upgrade[CR]mid-game. Please consult the readme for full details.</plot>

    <plot>A second Super Mario Bros. 3 hack! The levels in this hack are vastly[CR]different from the original game, to feel like a completely new experience![CR]Levels don't start out terribly difficult, but get tricky later on, though[CR]they never become unfair. Secrets are strewn throughout the many levels,[CR]including new levels for the White Mushroom Houses, with new coin[CR]requirements, and the hidden whistle.[CR]Read Me:[CR]Franks Super Super[CR]Mario Bros. 3 Hack[CR]2004, 2005 Frank M.[CR]Contact:[CR]golden_road15@hotmail.com[CR]Version 1.10[CR]Last Update: April 23, 2005--[CR]Found an unused fortress that Id created, yet never pointed anywhere: guess I[CR]forgot to put it in. Anyway, its now the second fortress in World 4. The[CR]original second fortress in World 4 is now the second fortress in World 3, and[CR]the original second fortress in WOrld 3 is gone, since it wasnt too great a[CR]level to begin with anyway.[CR]Heres yet another hack of Super Mario Bros. 3.[CR]But hey, after a few hundred bad Super Mario World hacks, we havent had enough[CR]bad Super Mario Bros. 3 hacks as of late... but this wont be one of them. This[CR]may not change the world like DahrkDaizs Super Mario Adventure, but this[CR]should prove for a most worthwhile playthrough.[CR]Also, for those of you[CR]still having nightmares about that first Super Mario Bros. 3 hacks Id made:[CR]this one should not be as difficult or frustrating or unfair. Aside from that,[CR]the levels themselves have been much better made this time around, for[CR]hopefully, an almost completely new experience for those who play the[CR]game.[CR]White Mushroom Houses: The white mushroom houses store great items[CR]inside. Trouble is, of course, getting them to appear. In a certain level, you[CR]must collect a minimum number of coins. Well, at least part of the help is[CR]coming: considering the difficulty, Im listing the levels in which you can get[CR]a white mushroom house, though not the number of coins youll need, hee hee.[CR]Even in even-numbered worlds, it may be well worth your time, with a prize[CR]better than that stupid anchor....[CR]World 1: 1-2[CR]World 2: The[CR]Fortress[CR]World 3: 3-4[CR]World 4: 4-4[CR]World 5: 5-8[CR]World 6:[CR]6-9[CR]World 7: 7-7[CR]The Hammer and You: The hammers you collect in each[CR]world can be especially useful. The worlds of the Mushroom Kingdom have many[CR]rocks in many paths, so planning for the future can be most helpful. You can[CR]get up to 2 hammers in each of the first 7 worlds, for a total of 14. With 42[CR]breakable rocks around, that means you can only destroy a third of them. How,[CR]or when, you use them... thats up to you. To help you plan, heres a small list[CR]of the number of rocks in each of the eight worlds:[CR]World 1: 2[CR]World 2:[CR]4[CR]World 3: 9[CR]World 4: 7[CR]World 5: 2[CR]World 6: 10[CR]World 7:[CR]2[CR]World 8: 6[CR]The Warp Whistle: Yes, yes, there is the whistle hidden[CR]somewhere in the game, though no one is entirely sure where. Rumor has it that[CR]wings are needed to find it. Rumor also has it that the name of the level is[CR]written in the desert sky. Course, who ever believed rumors, anyway....</plot>

    <plot>I started learning how to ROM hack in the summer of 1997, and by the next[CR]summer I felt comfortable enough to start working on projects with the intent[CR]of releasing them. The first to be completed was this hack. Fresh from beating[CR]the FF3j translation, and amazed by the release of the original DOS version of[CR]Tile Layer, I decided to make Gauntlet into a FF3j themed game. The graphics[CR]are mostly copy/pastes from the first three FF games, with some craptastic[CR]artwork done by myself as needed... 100% of the graphics and text were[CR]altered, but there's a problem with the way I did the wall graphics (You can't[CR]see the breakable tiles, which proves to be a major pain in the ass in certain[CR]levels). Also, there is no level, sound or assembly hacking (All beyond my[CR]abilities at the time). However, the story is kind of interesting if you liked[CR]FF3j, as it's a direct sequel to it.[CR]Read Me:[CR]Final Fantasy Epic[CR]v.03 Final [CR]Hacked by Sliver X (sliverx@hotmail.com)[CR]Original game:[CR]Gauntlet[CR]***************************************************[CR]What you[CR]need:[CR]An unaltered rom of Gauntlet.[CR]An IPS patching program.[CR]This IPS[CR]file.[CR]***************************************************[CR]This hack is[CR]basically a cut and paste of various[CR]Final Fantasy graphics into Gauntlet,[CR]with a few[CR]original graphics made by me. (You should be able[CR]to tell[CR]which those are by the shitty quality of[CR]them. Most noticably the character[CR]portraits. Im[CR]not exactly a graphic artist.)[CR]This is the final release.[CR]I acually got it done ahead of[CR]schedule, which surprised the hell out of[CR]me. [CR]***************************************************[CR]Just what the[CR]hell is new in this version?[CR]Everything is now finished. I fixed the walls,[CR]the villain[CR]at the beginning, the dragon,ect ect. I kept the map though,[CR]and the teleporters due to the fact that I didnt really think[CR]they[CR]needed to be changed. Also Ive changed the text[CR]and written a story for[CR]this. I strongly recommend you use Loopynes[CR]for this hack, as NESticle cant[CR]display some of the scrolling[CR]text[CR]properly.[CR]***************************************************[CR]Whats[CR]next?[CR]Im going to start working on my Dragon Warrior hack, Dragoon X.[CR]Id[CR]say itll be anywhere from 2 weeks to a month before Im done[CR]with it.

    <plot>About This Hack: The purpose of this hack is to take an already great game and[CR]greatly improve on it by enhancing it with special features, ironing out[CR]wrinkles in the gameplay (poor balance, annoying quirks, and game-breaking[CR]bugs); and to a somewhat lesser extent, to put the author's own personal spin[CR]on the game. Notable Changes From FF1: * Many bugfix and enhancement patches[CR]made by other ROMhackers applied * New, animated title added at game startup *[CR]Menu color can be changed-press B at the title repeatedly to cycle through the[CR]available colors * Names of most things expanded and altered * Saving is now[CR]done from the main menu instead of via inns, tents, and such * You can now[CR]sort your magic spells and delete unwanted ones * In-game world map slightly[CR]improved; now accessed by pressing Select+Start instead of B+Select * B-Button[CR]dash available at all times, even on the airship * Water and such things are[CR]animated now, and some areas have palette-cycling effects * Default (pre-[CR]bought/equipped) equipment and spells added at new game * Censored graphics[CR]from the Japanese version restored * Boss battles have their own songs now,[CR]instead of the normal battle music * Dual-wield ability given to Ninja and[CR]Monk/High Monk * Random battle rate is slightly decreased if a Rogue or Ninja[CR]is the party leader * A few new stat-boosting consumable items added * Most[CR]damaging-dealing spells should usually hit in the greater half of their damage[CR]range now * Elemental magic does 2x (instead of 1.5x) damage against[CR]vulnerable enemies (3x if at level 50) * Some spells switched around; some had[CR]effects and/or effectivity altered * Properties of some weapons and armor[CR]altered; some were changed into entirely different things * Shop inventories[CR]modified a bit; prices of many things lowered a little * Sanctuary (formerly[CR]Clinic) can now heal petrification and poison, in addition to death * Magic[CR]Evasion of most foes lowered to a more reasonable amount * Enemy groups'[CR]"ambush" values now roughly scale with the point in the game in which they are[CR]met * Several area maps altered a bit (mostly cosmetically) and quite a few[CR]treasures changed * A few walk-through-able secret walls added here and there[CR]* Some towns have a hidden treasure to find * Two hidden bonus areas added:[CR]one accessed from the first town (but only late in the game) and one from the[CR]last town, south of the hidden magic shops * Ship puzzle game now gives 500[CR]Gold (50000 if at level 50) * All party members always gain experience after[CR]battle, even if dead or petrified * In determining preemptives/ambushes, all[CR]party members' Agility and Luck are considered (rather than only the[CR]leader's);

    <plot>Mother: 25th Anniversary Edition aims to make Mother much more enjoyable for[CR]both Earthbound fans and those playing it for the first time. All enemy[CR]graphics, NPC sprites and tiles are be redrawn from scratch to be more[CR]faithful to the clay models. The goofy enemies are goofier and the creepy[CR]enemies are creepier. A shiny new font and title screen was added, too! The[CR]overworld has been tweaked to be much less bleak and repetitive, so it's[CR]harder to get lost. There is more scenery, areas are more colorful and[CR]confusing areas like Duncan's factory have been simplified. On the other hand,[CR]tiny areas like the Cemetery or Snowman have been expanded. There are also a[CR]lot of changes under the hood. Enemies will yield slightly more exp and the[CR]encounter rate has been readjusted. The "Dangerous Foe" battle theme is used[CR]less often and party members will be met at a higher level. DragonDePlatino's[CR]goal in creating this hack was to make Mother less challenging, but still[CR]quite difficult. And last but not least, this hack uses Tomato's official[CR]Mother 1 + 2 translation, adapted for the NES. Over 1400 lines of text have[CR]been altered to create connections with the rest of the series, improve[CR]clarity and shorten reading time. This hack will also feature much quicker[CR]battle text courtesy of vince94. Battles progress almost twice as[CR]quickly![CR]Read[CR]Me:[CR]=========================================================================[CR]PLAYING[CR]THIS ROM[CR]HACK[CR]=========================================================================[CR]Mother:[CR]25th Anniversary Edition is a ROM hack of Earth Bound, the[CR]unreleased[CR]American prototype of Mother.

Money mushrooms, invisible Mario, time stopping[CR]potions, Kuribo shoes in any level that don't disappear, shy guys that create[CR]projectiles, heat seeking bullet bills, and others are just the beginning of[CR]the changes made to this game. On top of that, you have random weather[CR]patterns on every stage, boss battles on every stage, and infinite lives, so[CR]your coins go to more useful purposes. They will be used to buy items from[CR]Toad's house and get some level exits to appear. Let's not forget stored, and[CR]switchable, power ups such as those found in Super Mario World! This[CR]description really doesn't do this hack justice. It's certainly impressive to[CR]say the least. Just download it and try it out! It's definitely one of the[CR]most advanced SMB3 hacks to date and pretty darn fun as well![CR]Read[CR]Me:[CR]Mario Adventure Simple[CR]Manual[CR]--------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]How[CR]to Patch[CR]Depending on the version of the SMB3 rom you have, youll have to[CR]use a different patch.[CR]Mario_Adventure_0.ips is for the SMB3 rom Super[CR]Mario Bros. 3 (PRG 0) U.nes rom file name.[CR]Mario_Adventure_1.ips is for the[CR]SMB3 rom Super Mario Bros. 3 (PRG 1) U.nes rom file name.[CR]They are not the[CR]same, so if one doesnt work, try the other, if that doesnt work, get a[CR]new[CR]rom.[CR]This hack should work with most major emulators, including Nesticle[CR](though if you[CR]use Nesticle, you may want to use save states, since the[CR]SRAM isnt supported for SMB3 in[CR]Nesticle). I recommend using[CR]FCEU.[CR]--------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Palette[CR]If[CR]your emulator supports palette files, use the included palette file[CR]called[CR]Mario_Adventure.pal. It is fx3s palette file, but I renamed it since[CR]some emulators [CR]support file name palette association. If you do not use[CR]FX3s palette, the game will NOT[CR]look the same. So take 3 seconds out of[CR]your life and load that palette (included) with my hack[CR]to get the full[CR]enjoyment.[CR]--------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Central[CR]Hub and the Worlds:[CR]The Central Hub is the Warp Zone. From here Mario can[CR]access any world 1 through 7. Beating a world only requires Mario[CR]beat the[CR]Koopa Kid of that world. Once Mario beats a world, a small box on the lower[CR]right will have a check mark[CR]in the proper world box (1-7, going left to[CR]right). Mario can play any world at any time. To leave a world, either[CR]beat[CR]it or reset the game. After complete a world, Mario can re-enter it[CR]from the Warp Zone and skip over the levels[CR]freely move simply moving over[CR]them. Not only can Mario re-enter worlds, but he can else re-enter beaten[CR]levels in[CR]the current world. However, if you reset your game mid-world, you[CR]WILL have to replay all the levels again! Only[CR]completing a world will[CR]allow Mario to skip levels.[CR]Its also rumored that something happens when[CR]you complete all the worlds and unlock all the[CR]locks![CR]--------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Saving:[CR]The[CR]game will save some of your progress as you go along. The game saves the[CR]following statuses:[CR]Coins[CR]Score[CR]Time[CR]All Items[CR]Item[CR]Box[CR]Kuribo Shoe Storage[CR]Worlds Completed[CR]Keys Gotten[CR]Locks[CR]Unlocked[CR]This will save as part of the battery back up, thus, if you want[CR]to play fair, you dont have to use save[CR]states.[CR]-------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Erasing[CR]A Game[CR]At the title screen, when Press Start appears, press [Up] + [Select][CR]to bring the erase game prompt.[CR]Pressing [A] will erase the game, pressing[CR][B] will cancel[CR]it.[CR]--------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Keys[CR]Each[CR]world has 1 hidden key in it. Mario must travel from level to level completing[CR]each and keeping an eye for[CR]any odd areas that might be a potential door[CR]way to a key! If Mario cant find it, he can always go back later[CR]on after[CR]receiving a clue after defeating the Koopa Kids. There are keys, there are[CR]locks on the Warp Zone.[CR]Coincidence? I think[CR]not![CR]--------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Coins[CR]As[CR]normally expected, Mario can collect coins through out levels. However, these[CR]coins do not give extra lives.[CR]Instead, Mario might want to take them to[CR]the local Mushroom Houses to spend! He may walk out with something good[CR]or[CR]something bad! Try searching for hidden golden mushrooms for a quick coin[CR]bonus! Marios pockets can[CR]only hold 9999[CR]coins.[CR]-------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Items[CR]Mario[CR]has a plethora of new items at his disposal! The Spade and Heart power-ups can[CR]give twice the advantage[CR]where else the coin power-up can make the Mushroom[CR]coin currancy rate sky rocket! The Warp whistle used to take you[CR]to the[CR]Warp Zone, but what does it do now? Just try it and find out for yourself![CR]Every world has something to[CR]offer for the Warp[CR]Whistle![CR]-------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Power[CR]Ups[CR]Mario has a few new power ups for this adventure, namely the newest[CR]ones are the following:[CR]Fire Fire Mario:[CR] Fire Fire Mario is just like[CR]Fire Mario, except he throws straight fireballs that can go through walls[CR]and[CR] he can jump higher![CR]Invisible Mario:[CR] From the Mario 64 era,[CR]Invisible Mario can temporarily go behind any background on a level. Pressing[CR][Down] + [B][CR] activates his power for a limited time. While behind a[CR]background, Mario is almost invulnerable to attack. On[CR] the plus side,[CR]Invisible Mario can stomp many more enemies with this power up![CR]Magic[CR]Mario:[CR] Magic Mario is one tough cookie! He can take a punch three times[CR]before hes down! He throws magic stars[CR] that are quite powerful and he can[CR]stomp a lot of enemies down![CR]Kuribos Mario:[CR] Not a new power up, but now[CR]Mario can use the shoe in any level and in any situation! Beating a level[CR]doesnt[CR] steal the shoe away, looks like Mario better grow some bigger[CR]feet![CR]-------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]New[CR]Controls[CR]A few new controls must be talked about before youre on youre[CR]adventure![CR]-------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Item Box[CR] The Item Box returns from SMW. Grabbing two items in a row will[CR]store the previous one into the item box.[CR] Pressing [Select] will switch[CR]out your current power up with the one in your box. You cant store your[CR]current power up into the box if the box is already empty.[CR]-------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Kuribos Storage[CR] Kuribos shoe cant swim, so if Mario must get rid of it for[CR]any reason, he can do so by pressing[CR] [Up] + [B] at the SAME time. The[CR]timing must be right! If successful, a K will appear on the status bar on[CR]the[CR] mid-left area. Pessing [Up] + [B] again at the SAME time will retrieve[CR]any stored shoe. You can have two[CR] shoes at once this method, so if the[CR]shoe you have wont store, be sure there isnt one already in storage![CR]-------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Cheat[CR]Codes[CR]Thats right! Mario can cheat if he wants! But there are no cheat[CR]codes available at the moment except for one![CR]-------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Sound Test[CR] To access the sound test, at the title screen where it says[CR]Press Start press the following:[CR] Up Up Down Down Left Right Left Right B A[CR]Select[CR] Press Left or Right to change track an A to play the[CR]track.[CR]-------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]FAQ[CR](SPOILERS HERE!)[CR]1. I cant find the way out of this level![CR] Try searchin[CR]again, or collecting many coins.[CR]2. How come the exit doesnt appear in the[CR]level that requires you to get coins?[CR] Move around the level a bit, make[CR]sure the screen scrolls because if you get the last coin[CR] on the same[CR]screen the door is suppose to appear, it wont show up, moving off the screen[CR]to a different[CR] part of a level and back will make it appear.[CR]3. How[CR]come my last item went away?[CR] If you have a full inventory, grabbing items[CR]will erase your last item. So if your last item is a key, DO[CR] NOT GET[CR]ANOTHER ITEM. Keys cannot be gotten twice![CR]4. Why does it rain/snow?[CR]That is randomly determined part of the game. It adds more variety and keeps[CR]you on your toes and is[CR] a neat effect![CR]5. What if I find a bug?[CR]Unless it actually affects game play in a bad way, dont report it (i.e. dont[CR]report graphical problems).[CR]6. Can I have some of the hacks in Mario[CR]Adventure for my hack?[CR] Nope, sorry.[CR]7. Are you going to work on Mario[CR]Seasons anymore?[CR] For the moment, no. I may pick it back up later.</plot>

    <plot>This is the sequel to my first hack [Maverick[CR]Revenge](http://www.romhacking.net/hacks/562/) for Mega Man IV. This time it's[CR]based on Mega Man V. I am kinda done with "hacking", since I still haven't[CR]learned any ASM. Therefore this hack will never be more finished then it is.[CR]You can play to the last Wily stage, however you won't get longer. Also, after[CR]the last Proto Man stage it may seem like the game has frozen, but it will go[CR]on if you just wait. Because of that I never learned ASM I couldn't do what I[CR]really wanted - to add Maverick instead of robot masters, therefore the[CR]confusing name. I understand it may seem weird, but that's the explanation.[CR]What you actually CAN do in this hack, to not confuse anyone: * Finish all 8[CR]robot masters * Finish all Proto Man stages * Finish to the last Wily stage *[CR]Collect ALL MEGAMANV letters, yes they are there but well hidden :) The[CR]soundtrack is also changed. I tried to push the NES graphic-wise as much as[CR]possible, and there I think I did succeed in some ways.</plot>

Really, you should savestate before[CR]entering, when you have full HP, and definitely before you jump in the water.[CR]Its THAT cool.[CR] * The SKY Level...is almost as cool, but not quite. It may[CR]slow down a bit, but only because your computer is obviously not cool enough[CR]for it. Save again.[CR] * Dont DIE!..thats not cool. Because sometimes(90% of[CR]the time) when you respawn at the halfway mark of some levels ...every single[CR]bad guy within 4 screens will spawn right next to you as punishment for[CR]dieing. Also, if you die fighting a boss...the game might (40%) reset[CR]automatically...thats not a bug..its a feature..k guys.[CR] How to Play:[CR] In the zip file you downloaded from either[CR]http://www.freewebs.com/digitalspace/index.htm[CR] or[CR]http://romhacking.deadbeat-inc.com/[CR] there should be 3 files:[CR]MegamanMushroimKingdom.ips[CR] fx3nespal.pal[CR] and this Readme.txt[CR] Using[CR]a file patcher program, patch the ips file to a clean Megaman(U).nes rom [CR]Then after you load the rom into your emulator, load the .pal file to make the[CR]game colors look right.[CR] You can get a simple to use file patcher program[CR]here: http://fusoya.panicus.org/lips/index.html[CR] and a great NES emulator[CR]here: http://www.zophar.net/nes.html[CR] I hope you enjoy my hack, feedback is[CR]greatly appreciated as well.</plot>

    <plot>This is the first time Mike Vincent have tried to edit a game, and with zero[CR]programming skills it wasn't easy. But with some help from MegaFLE X and[CR]Matrix, he was able to anyway. There are some KNOWN bugs in this hack, because[CR]of limited knowledge of ASM, he wasn't able to fix everything. Don't get[CR]confused by the name, it doesn't have anything to do with the Mavericks. There[CR]is no story line in this game, no intro or anything. It's just a game! The[CR]bosses and enemies are generally the same, but the levels have been completely[CR]changed, as have some of the graphics Happy gaming! :)</plot>

    <plot>This is a ROM hack of Capcom's Mega Man III for the NES, which includes the[CR]following: * New levels * New music (some songs from other MM games and some[CR]original songs) * A new title screen * Minor graphic changes Please be advised[CR]that this hack is more difficult than the original game and is aimed towards[CR]players who master the original game quite well.[CR]Read Me:[CR]Mega Man[CR]3: The Battle of Gamma[CR]Version 1.0[CR]- by[CR]DurfarC[CR]--------------------------------------------------[CR]This is a ROM[CR]hack of Capcoms Mega Man 3 for the NES. All levels have been redesigned, new[CR]music has been made, a new title screen has been created, the colour palettes[CR]have been changed and some minor graphics have been edited.[CR]As you may[CR]know, I also made another hack of Mega Man 3 called The Rise and Fall of Dr.[CR]Wily, which I released in 2009. This hack has nothing to do with that one; the[CR]only reason for making another hack of Mega Man 3 is simply because it is my[CR]favourite Mega Man game. This time I decided to throw some custom made music[CR]into the hack as well, which I hope youll enjoy. Now you probably want to know[CR]why I didnt edit all the graphics and the enemies as well and make a really[CR]unique hack - the reason for that is that unlike my musical knowledge, my[CR]programming and drawing skills are really, really bad. Besides, as I already[CR]implied, I find the original level designs and enemies great as they already[CR]are. For the record, the title of the hack is just something random I came up[CR]with.[CR]Like last time, I tried to make the hack hard enough for some[CR]challenge, but not so hard that people must use save states to complete it.[CR]This means that there are no rooms you have to take damage to get past, no[CR]traps that are totally non-obvious and no extremely tight jumps that cannot be[CR]bypassed in an alternative manner.[CR]------[CR]How to play:[CR]The IPS file[CR]you have downloaded is to be patched to a Mega Man 3 ROM. Make a copy of the[CR]original, unmodified ROM, rename it if you wish and patch the IPS file to the[CR]newly created file. I recommend using Lunar IPS to do this task, you can find[CR]it with a simple Google search.[CR]Have fun![CR]------[CR]Known[CR]bugs/glitches/problems:[CR]- In Wily Stage 1, the water splash animation is[CR]sometimes shown when you climb the ladder in the underwater section or if you[CR]die in the boss room and respawn between the boss gates. This is because there[CR]were no such situations in the original game, so that Capcom didnt have to[CR]care about fixing it.[CR]------[CR]Hints and tips:[CR]- Like in my previous[CR]Mega Man 3 hack, it is possible to clear every single stage without getting[CR]hit. For the Doc Robot and Wily stages, robot master weapons must be used to[CR]achieve this, primarily search snakes, shadow blades and magnet missiles. (The[CR]bosses and their chambers are the same as before, so dont blame me if you[CR]still cant beat Doc-Flash Man Without getting hit.)[CR]- In Magnet Mans stage,[CR]when you come to the large bottomless pit, you must go back a few steps and[CR]take a ride with the magnet guy in order to get across. I drew a sign on the[CR]ground to let you know, but in case it wasnt totally obvious, I thought it was[CR]best to mention it anyway.[CR]- If you die at a obligatory Rush Jet section[CR]and have no weapon energy left when you respawn, there are always some enemies[CR]before the section that you can kill over and over again until you get a[CR]weapon refill.[CR]- Remember that when using Rush Jet, you can hop continously[CR]in order to use less weapon energy. This strategy isnt required in order to[CR]complete a stage, but just like in the original game, it can be useful[CR]sometimes.[CR]- Take your time! Trying to rush through the stages without[CR]stopping certainly isnt going to help you, unless you really know what youre[CR]doing.[CR]------[CR]List of new songs:[CR]Spark Man: Composed by myself[CR](2009)[CR]Snake Man: Composed by myself (2009-2011)[CR]Needle Man: The result[CR]of some bugs in my old midi sequencer made me get this interesting result out[CR]of Needle Mans original song, although I had to re-sequence it and change it a[CR]bit.[CR]Hard Man: Hard Man || Mega Man 2 || Game Boy[CR]Top Man: Air Man ||[CR]Mega Man 2 || Game Boy[CR]Gemini Man: Pluto || Mega Man V || Game[CR]Boy[CR]Magnet Man: Magnet Man || Mega Man 2 || Game Boy[CR]Shadow Man:[CR]Composed by myself (2009-2011)[CR]Wily 1-2: Composed by myself (2011)[CR]Wily[CR]3-4: Composed by myself (2011)[CR]Wily 5-6: Composed by myself (2011)[CR]The[CR]rest of the music hasnt been changed, since these songs arent heard that often[CR]- Editing music in a hex editor is a time consuming process, after all.[CR]Due[CR]to space limitations, most of the songs are shorter or more simple than those[CR]they replaced.[CR]You are free to use any of my songs in your own ROM hack, as[CR]long as you credit me in your readme file. Id just appreciate if people like[CR]my songs that much (although I doubt it), and theres no way I can prevent[CR]people from opening the hack with a hex editor and use them anyway.[CR]The[CR]songs from other Mega Man games are not true copies of the original versions;[CR]instruments, sound effects and a few notes were sometimes altered out of my[CR]own preference.[CR]All the songs have been optimized for the FCEUX emulator -[CR]it could be that they sound a little different when using other emulators,[CR]primarily related to the sound effects.[CR]------[CR]Thanks to:[CR]Matrixz -[CR]The author of both MegaFLE X and the text document I used in order to learn[CR]how the music data works.[CR]------[CR]DurfarC - 2011</plot>

    <plot>Mega Man III Return changes the majority of the graphics from the original[CR]Mega Man III. Level design, enemy placement, and enemy resistances have also[CR]been altered in order to ramp up the difficulty, but there are no true[CR]modifications made to the AI. If you were looking for a Mega Man III hack with[CR]new gameplay elements and enemy actions, I'm afraid this isn't the hack you're[CR]looking for. If you are looking for a challenge, though, you might want to[CR]consider trying it out. You can read more of my prattle in the readme file,[CR]yo.[CR]Read Me:[CR]Mega / Rock Man III Return v1.0[CR]2009 Pantheon[CR]Sasuke[CR]----------------------------------------------[CR]Okay, this is my[CR]first serious attempt at a game hack. I chose Mega Man 3[CR]because, well,[CR]Mega Man 3 seems the least popular. I mean, compared to all[CR]the Mega Man 2[CR]hacks Ive seen/heard of. Then again, I kinda live under a[CR]rock, so chances[CR]are there are really big, impressive hacks out there of[CR]Mega Man 3 that I[CR]havent at all seen.[CR]On that note, I wasnt going for anything tremendous or[CR]ground-breaking when[CR]I started work on this. I wanted to try and keep[CR]things within my limited[CR]knowledge since I was afraid I might lose interest[CR]on account of frustrations[CR]brought about from ideas too ambitious. Due to[CR]this, all youll really see[CR]in this hack are changes in graphics and enemy[CR]resistances and damage done to[CR]Mega Man. Im afraid youve downloaded the[CR]wrong hack if you were looking[CR]for dramatic AI changes or new gameplay[CR]mechanics.[CR]Of course, Im not trying to belittle myself on the work Ive[CR]done. I[CR]certainly put a lot of hours into making this hack, a lot of that[CR]time spent[CR]making custom tiles and pixeling them in again in Mega FLEX. I[CR]would have[CR]loved to make changes to the music and even enemy actions if I[CR]had the[CR]knowledge and tools to do so, but, as previously stated, I didnt[CR]want to[CR]get too extreme with what I planned. There were already far too[CR]many times I[CR]took breaks while working on Mega Man III Return, so theres no[CR]telling[CR]when this wouldve gotten done had I expanded upon my work[CR]load.[CR]I found out a lot about the program and the way things work in Mega[CR]FLEX.[CR]By running test versions I learned how some of my ideas would turn[CR]out, as[CR]well as how some of the options function (notably the setting of[CR]checkpoints,[CR]which require one to state the nearest enemy in hex as opposed[CR]to the normal[CR]numbering displayed in the enemy editor, something that can[CR]probably be[CR]changed in the configuration but can cause problems[CR]nonetheless). I also[CR]discovered, at a bit of a late point, how tiles can[CR]link to one another.[CR]This is most apparent in Gemini Mans level, where the[CR]lower two quadrants[CR]of the tile sheet will revert to those of Snake Mans[CR]level during the[CR]scene with Proto Man. Of course, if one skips Proto Man or[CR]removes him[CR]entirely this will cause the quadrants to stay this way, which[CR]can lead to[CR]some unsightly situations. I found a way to remedy this,[CR]thankfully, though[CR]it would later pose some problems for when making new[CR]tiles for the Doc[CR]Robot Gemini level.[CR]You may notice while playing that[CR]some levels have an abundance of animated[CR]palettes while others dont. This[CR]was basically me going crazy with the[CR]option because of how mesmerized I[CR]was by it. It was later on that I found[CR]out that even only a slight tweak[CR]to one animation set can cause disastrous[CR]side-effects to other ones. This[CR]error actually forced me to resume the hack[CR]from a previous version (one of[CR]my few intelligent moves: saving in different[CR]versions) because of how[CR]trying to fix one animation set would only cause[CR]another to go out of[CR]whack. For those reading this ReadMe who may have plans[CR]on using Mega FLEX,[CR]try to save animations for a later point. Theyre[CR]definitely something extra[CR]for when you believe the hack to be finished[CR](unless an animation is[CR]integral to a stage, as you may notice with Spark[CR]Mans level).[CR]As of the[CR]typing of this ReadMe, only a few bugs have been noted, and none of[CR]these[CR]are really major. I must thank my friend Swordbearer for helping me[CR]out[CR]with play testing since, as the maker of the hack, there were most[CR]likely many[CR]things I would have never noticed. If you encounter a bad bug[CR]in the game, Id[CR]appreciate it if you could inform me (an e-mail is below}[CR]with DETAILS, and I[CR]apologize in advance if said bug ruins your experience[CR]with the game.[CR]Blah blah blah, blah blah blah blah blah. Seriously, does[CR]anyone even[CR]bother reading something like this once they see the giant[CR]explosion of text?[CR]You have my gratitude if youre a person who actually[CR]takes the times to read[CR]this stuff. Blah blah blah...[CR]As a final note[CR](before the Noted Bugs section) I was aiming to make this[CR]game difficult,[CR]so hopefully those who always wanted more of a challenge out[CR]of Mega Man 3[CR]will enjoy this hack. It isnt SUPER difficult, mind, but some[CR]of the[CR]obstacles I placed might cause some discontent in certain players. I[CR]must[CR]say that I am proud of one of the obstacles I came up with for the[CR]Wily[CR]levels... youll know what I mean when you get there.[CR]--- Noted Bugs[CR]---[CR]Spikes wont always be immediately recognized. That is, you can land on[CR]spikes,[CR]but you wont die until you try to move left or right. Thankfully,[CR]this bug[CR]isnt a common one and only occurs in the Doc Shadow level (from[CR]whats been[CR]observed).[CR]Hammer Joes hammer can be destroyed with the Mega[CR]Buster after he throws[CR]it. I have no idea how this happened, and Im pretty[CR]sure it cant be[CR]destroyed in the original...[CR]The Weapon Get text[CR]following the Snake Man fight will appear over Mega Man as a[CR]result of a[CR]modification made to Snake Mans arena. This bug has no harmful[CR]side-effects[CR]beyond looking weird, so I let it slide.[CR]Remember that Mega Man freezes on[CR]the spot after defeating a boss. Without[CR]trying to give too much away, Id[CR]advice standing or being above solid ground upon[CR]defeating a certain few[CR]bosses.[CR]If you are getting pushed and try to grab a ladder, you have to[CR]keep climbing it.[CR]You will resume getting pushed if you just grab[CR]on.[CR]------------------[CR]Mega Man III / Rock Man 3 is an original creation[CR]of Capcom and is owned by[CR]that company. If you think I am trying to claim[CR]this game as my own, Id have[CR]to call your intelligence into question. I[CR]made this hack simply as a form[CR]of hobby and have no intention of[CR]exploiting it for material gain.[CR]If you gots any questions,[CR]recommendations, insults, or the like, send them[CR]to[CR]sasuke1986[AT]hotmail[DOT]com. Would spammies even look in a readme,[CR]though?[CR]I might answer. Might.</plot>

    <plot>Made by talented ROM hacker: Puresabe, comes Rockman 4: Minus Infinity. One of[CR]the best ROM hacks that does what others only dream of achieving. The levels,[CR]bosses, weapons and even the choice of music of the original Rockman 4 have[CR]been improved to a level that far exceeds an aesthetic standpoint - bosses[CR]have new attack patterns, weapons and moves (such as the distinguishable[CR]'desperation' moves that speed up the music and make the bosses angrier and[CR]faster). The levels have branching pathways and hidden bosses from past Mega[CR]Man/Rockman games that won't fail to put a smile on your face (such as[CR]Shadowman robbing the Egyptian temple, or Crashman hiding in the weapons[CR]artillery of Drillman's stage), the music is very well chosen from a variety[CR]of different games, and new enemies from earlier and later games in the[CR]franchise, not found in the original Rockman 4, make an already fantastic[CR]piece of programming a platforming masterpiece.

    <plot>Mega Man Showdown IV is the boss-only version of Mega Man IV that makes all[CR]stages except for Cossack 1, and Cossack 2 only 2 screens. Wily 3 are where[CR]you re-fight old bosses. All boss stats have been edited (EX version only),[CR]all weapon energy consumption amounts have been edited, except music. This[CR]should be the final version of Mega Man Showdown IV of v1.00 unless bugs are[CR]discovered. Also note that Mega Man Showdown IV you start with 0 lives which[CR]is new in this Showdown series and you get to choose between Normal and Hard[CR]modes depending what patch are you using. The EX version of Mega Man Showdown[CR]IV brings more life to the game. All Bosses are customized to be stronger and[CR]harder to defeat meaning that they're hyperactive and the hard mode version[CR]patches simply won't give you any reflex time after getting hit. The original[CR]showdown series is created by Vagla of Dragon Eye Studios.[CR]Read[CR]Me:[CR]Megaman Showdown 4[CR]A hack for Mega Man IV, NOT Rockman 4[CR](c)2009[CR]Insectduel[CR]Version[CR]1.00[CR]=============================================================================[CR]Description[CR]=============================================================================[CR]MMS4[CR]is the boss-only version of Mega Man 4. Megaman Showdown 4 is basically my own[CR]project because Mega Man IV is one of my favorite games. So I started the[CR]project and quickly find some data on my own until I added a few on[CR]Datacrystal and used their notes as well. Someday, Ill work on my long-term[CR]Mega Man IV project. So Showdown 4 is the only one completed right now. MMS4[CR]is a hack of the original MM4 that makes all stages except for Cossack 1, and[CR]Cossack 2 only 2 screens. Wily 3 are where you refight old bosses.[CR]All boss[CR]stats have been edited (EX Version only), all weapon energy consumption[CR]amounts have been edited, etc etc etc except music but feel free to add if you[CR]want. I really dont need to add music to this hack unless Im working on some[CR]long-term Mega Man IV hack.[CR]This should be the final version of MMS4 of[CR]v1.00 unless bugs are discovered. Also note that MMS4 you start witn 0 lives[CR]which is new in this Showdown series and you get to choose between Normal and[CR]Hard modes depending what patch are you using.[CR]The original hack is created[CR]by Vagla of Dragon Eye Studios. 7 years ago when both Mega Man Showdown I and[CR]Mega Man Showdown VI were[CR]made.[CR]=============================================================================[CR]Installation[CR]=============================================================================[CR]You[CR]need the Mega Man 4 (U) ROM to apply these patches, NOT Rockman 4.[CR]To[CR]install it, use the IPS patcher (like WinIPS or LunarIPS) and follow the[CR]instructions to apply the patch on the ROM. Be sure you patch it with the[CR]correct version of after renaming the rom.[CR]mms4.ips - Normal[CR]Version[CR]mms4hard.ips - Normal Version with no reflex time.[CR]mms4EX.ips -[CR]EX Version[CR]mms4EXhard.ips - EX Version with no reflex time.[CR]The EX[CR]Version of Megaman Showdown 4 brings more life to the game. All Bosses are[CR]customized to be stronger and harder to defeat meaning that theyre[CR]hyperactive. I have spent countless hours trying to modify their settings and[CR]new settings I created.[CR]As a result, you cannot guarantee that theyre easy[CR]to beat. :P And the WIRE weapon is your friend in this[CR]hack.[CR]=============================================================================[CR]Recommended[CR]Emulators[CR]=============================================================================[CR]I[CR]recommend FCE Ultra, G-NES, RockNES or Nestopia for this hack. When you use[CR]these emulators, it will most likely play on the real NES/Famicom. You should[CR]not use old and inaccurate emulators like NESticle, VirtuaNES, Nester J,[CR]NNNester J Unofficial Nester, and even J-nes.[CR]However, VirtuaNES seems[CR]pretty good if youre doing Time-Attack when recording your movie gameplay. The[CR]recent FCE Ultra Emulator is FCE Ultra X Version 2.1.0 which can be[CR]downloadable from Zophars[CR]Domain.[CR]=============================================================================[CR]Whats[CR]new in Megaman Showdown[CR]4[CR]=============================================================================[CR]-No[CR]reflex times. (Hard Mode Patches only)[CR]-Start with Half-Energy.[CR]-Start[CR]with 0 lives.[CR]-Boss weakness are different than MM4.[CR]-Boss AI edited.[CR](EX Version patches only)[CR]-The Max number of E-Tanks is now 4 instead of[CR]9.[CR]-Music not inserted.[CR]-Some bosses have HP above 28. (EX Version[CR]patches only)[CR]-Weapon Consuption edited.[CR]-Game Stats and Levels[CR]Edited.[CR]-Cannot access to Passswords in Title Screen.[CR]-Some text[CR]edited.[CR]=============================================================================[CR]Reversion[CR]History[CR]=============================================================================[CR]February[CR]26, 2009 - Started[CR]April 24, 2009 - Version 0.98, Private Release only for[CR]Insectduels Board Staff for BETA-Testing reasons.[CR]April 30, 2009 - Version[CR]1.00, Public[CR]Release[CR]=============================================================================[CR]Known[CR]Bugs[CR]=============================================================================[CR]None.[CR]Thank god and my BETA Testers including myself for playing this bloody[CR]game.[CR]=============================================================================[CR]About[CR]the Boss AI[CR]Edits[CR]=============================================================================[CR]I[CR]have spent most of time editing the AIs but some of them require Free Space[CR]like Ringman to add new ones. And I most likely change their LDA Settings[CR]including Object IDs which used for Brightman and Dr. Cossack for his huge[CR]plasma balls.[CR]Although, I couldnt get some of the bosses the way I wanted[CR]such as Ringmans Ring Aim-direct towards Megaman or the other ones. But this[CR]is the way I have for[CR]now.[CR]=============================================================================[CR]Missing[CR]Stuff[CR]=============================================================================[CR]I[CR]wanted the scrolls to go fast like Rock5easilys Rockman 4 patch but I have[CR]tried to convert the patch myself but 1 or more data were different data[CR]including VRAM data. I have no idea how they work but if you know about it,[CR]please give me a[CR]line.[CR]=============================================================================[CR]Credits[CR]=============================================================================[CR]Look[CR]in the credits when beating the game :D[CR]But also to Matrixz/Panophobia and[CR]Infidelity for sharing their cool findings. And Yosaku for keeping me[CR]entertained. The Armor GFX of Ringman is created by the author of Mega Man C4.[CR]And also thank the staff of Insectduels Board for BETA-Testing my hack and the[CR]bug findings. I have to fix a few before releasing.[CR]And 100%, No thanks[CR]to:[CR]Phet Vong a.k.a Phetmany Rathasvong (Username: Phetmany and[CR]Missiondestina) and Cynthia Banh, for wasting my time and effort on my ROM-[CR]Hacking project involving in some damn company. I have to admit, I do enjoying[CR]seeing and hanging out with them, but life is taken away from me very fast.[CR]And these Asian girls are also very attractive too which is a distraction.[CR]Phet is somewhat Vietnamese and Cynthia is Chinese. I may need to go back with[CR]them for family support reasons only.[CR]Vincent Rouge, for illegally told me[CR]to post all 5 illegal YOR Health videos in my YouTube Account BEFORE Phetmany[CR]plan to take legal actions against me and possibly Insectduels Domain if she[CR]sees it. All of them are set to private afterwards.[CR]Nick Bartola, for[CR]attracting me for his World Class Banquet video which made Vincent asked me to[CR]post it in public.[CR]Linda Chum, Unknown reason except making me a[CR]fool.[CR]Lashon Kempton, Making me a fool, lost my bag I carry for drinks, and[CR]got me lost during network marketing.

    <plot>Designed to be a somewhat harder extra game or "next loop" for Mega Man 6,[CR]this hack features new level layouts, different boss weaknesses and arenas,[CR]faster screen loads and menus, and a brand new, unarguably different plot from[CR]the original game. This hack was built with speedrunning in mind for MM6[CR]experts, but it should be accessible for most casual players as well. The[CR]readme includes an FAQ section if anything in the game is confusing. Intended[CR]for the US version of the game.[CR]Read[CR]Me:[CR]-------------------------[CR]Mega Man 6 Next Loop[CR]v1.2[CR]-------------------------[CR]by BaronHaynes[CR]Twitch:[CR]http://www.twitch.tv/baronhaynes[CR]Twitter:[CR]http://www.twitter.com/baronhaynes[CR]Thanks for playing my hack! [CR]Next[CR]Loop started as a Hard Mode hack in the style of Mega Man 9 or 10, with the[CR]same room layout but extra enemies and more pits. I got more ambitious as I[CR]went, learning how to edit more things, and even starting to change stage[CR]layouts a bit toward the end of the game. Its now more of an Extra Game or[CR]direct sequel style of hack, a Mega Man 6.5 or Mega Man 6 Part 2. [CR]My[CR]approach in designing stages and placing enemies was two-fold: Make something[CR]enjoyable and challenging for casual players wholl likely only play it once,[CR]but also facilitate a good speedrun for Mega Man 6 experts. Many screens are[CR]designed to be a lot of fun to do in an efficient way with specific weapons. I[CR]designed some sections knowing they could be trivialized or even bypassed by[CR]an experienced player. Others I tried to make cheese-proof. Overall, I tried[CR]to made a very good speedgame that doesnt lose anything as a casual[CR]game.[CR]Since 1.0, Ive fixed a hardlock issue involving ladders and smoothed[CR]out a couple of unfair sections throughout the game to make it more[CR]accessible. I dont have any current plans to update this hack unless a major[CR]problem or softlock is found, but its possible Ill come back and add some of[CR]the alternate paths back in (several were sealed off to help me finish the[CR]game faster).[CR]I used Mega FLE X for the stage editing and Tile Layer Pro[CR]for some of the graphical changes.[CR]I used FCEUX 2.2.2 to find a lot[CR]information and change things like boss weaknesses and other in-game values[CR]with its hex editor.[CR]--------------[CR]INSTALLATION[CR]--------------[CR]Use a program like LunarIPS to append the[CR].ips file to a Mega Man 6 (not Rockman 6)[CR]rom.[CR]http://fusoya.eludevisibility.org/lips/[CR]Use the standard version if[CR]you want original Mega Man 6 physics.[CR]Use the slidejump version if you want[CR]to be able to jump out of slides.[CR]It was designed with the original physics[CR]in mind, especially for speedrunning, so allowing for slidejumps makes it a[CR]very different experience. I actually havent had a chance to do a full[CR]playthrough of this version, but it should(?)[CR]work.[CR]---------------------------------[CR] LIKELY FAQ (INCLUDES[CR]SPOILERS!)[CR]---------------------------------[CR]-Why is it called Next[CR]Loop?[CR]Its intended to play like a second loop of Mega Man 6, or a[CR]sequel/extra game. That specific title comes from the end of Rockman 6: RE,[CR]which replaces the final credits text with "GO TO NEXT LOOP". Rockman 6: RE,[CR]or Spacefish as we nicknamed it, has a lot of personality as a romhack and[CR]inspired a lot of aggravation and affection, and GO TO NEXT LOOP became kind[CR]of a catchphrase for some speedrunner buddies, a message to keep[CR]trying.[CR]-Can you get through Torch Mans stage without using Jet?[CR]Yes.[CR]Thats not water, its oil. Your inertia from dropping into it determines[CR]whether youll float back up or not.[CR]-Can you get stuck in the oil?[CR]You[CR]shouldnt be able to, I was very careful to make sure you could always touch[CR]the ground, or at least die when that wasnt possible. Even if a cloud platform[CR]is blocking your path, you should be able to get over it eventually if you[CR]keep jumping.[CR]-I found a secret area in one of the castle stages. Is this[CR]impossible to beat?[CR]No, but its intended as a bonus challenge for[CR]savestates rather than something to be done in casual play or a speedrun. I[CR]was thinking about doing a Kaizo MM6 hack with jet and pow puzzles, as well as[CR]things like required ladder jumps, and did this as a test.[CR]-How do you get[CR]past the fan section in Mr. Y stage 2?[CR]Avoid using Jet, as it interacts[CR]with fans in frustrating ways. You want to delay your forward movement to get[CR]enough height to clear the edges of the fans, but not wait so long that you[CR]hit the spikes on the ceiling. With practice, this becomes an easy section,[CR]but a lot of players get stuck here for a little while.[CR]-Whats up with the[CR]weakness order?[CR]Its very nonlienar. All bosses have multiple weaknesses,[CR]and one of them only takes light damage from special weapons. I tried to[CR]ensure that the speedrun route could be versatile.[CR]-Why isnt the boss AI[CR]different?[CR]I wanted to complete this hack in a short amount of time, and[CR]was limited by what I knew how to do, or what I could find. MM6 also has a[CR]habit of using shared values for very different game mechanics, so I couldnt[CR]change boss AI without breaking other things, based on what I found during[CR]development. I tried to modify the arena or weaknesses to make the fights[CR]somewhat different than vanilla MM6, either in casual play or a[CR]speedrun.[CR]-I got zipped into the ceiling in Shield Man and died![CR]Yeah.[CR]Sorry about that! The ceiling moves so fast that if youre falling (or have[CR]just stopped moving) when it retracts, its geometry will overlap with yours[CR]and kill you. MM6 is very unforgiving if youre ever inside a wall for any[CR]reason. Try to be still when the ceiling is about to retract.[CR]-Gust Man[CR]went down the hole in the refights.[CR]I havent seen this happen personally,[CR]but apparently it can. Youll have to die once and try again. Sorry :X[CR]If[CR]his health falls down the pit, Mega Man should just teleport out and the boss[CR]is counted as beaten, at least when it happened to me.[CR]-Why does Eddie turn[CR]green when jumping on the bumpers in Shield Mans stage?[CR]The animation when[CR]jumping on a bumper is actually considered an enemy by the game, and it loads[CR]that enemys palette when it spawns. Its palette is different from Eddies, but[CR]the game stores both in the same location, so he ends up using it too.[CR]-Why[CR]does the skull jumper in Hatchet Man look glitchy?[CR]For some reason, the[CR]game doesnt update the enemy sprite sheet after the room with the mets in it[CR]until you first spawn that guy.[CR]-Why is Mechazauruss chest constantly[CR]exploding?[CR]He has heartburn.[CR](I wanted to remove the platforms and make[CR]that fight take place entirely on the springs, and the first solution Raiden[CR]found made them explode as soon as they spawned. He later found a way to do it[CR]without explosions, where the door would open and close but nothing would come[CR]out, but I thought the explosions were funny.)[CR]-Im stuck in Wily 4 without[CR]an E-Tank and the boss fight is too hard.[CR]There might be something helpful[CR]hidden in this stage somewhere. Look closely![CR]-Why did you use the US[CR]version?[CR]My main audience for this hack prefers the US version, and I[CR]wanted to write new dialogue for the absolutely all-new storyline in Next[CR]Loop. The US and Japanese versions play identically, but youll need to patch a[CR]US rom.[CR]-Why doesnt Next Loop have quick weapon-switching with select?[CR]I[CR]personally like quick-switching in romhacks, and have done speedruns of[CR]several MM5 hacks that have it. Since I run on emulator, I can rebind select[CR]to the R button on my SNES controller, which makes it much easier to cycle[CR]weapons with select and down+select. However, most of my audience for this[CR]hack while making it is speedrunners who play on console, where that isnt[CR]feasible without some controller surgery. I didnt want to force people to have[CR]to use the actual select button to cycle weapons in a speedrun (which I hate[CR]doing), so I just made the menu delay as small as possible. Switching weapons[CR]is quick enough that its still optimal to use them a lot throughout the game,[CR]without requiring any awkward select usage.[CR]-Why didnt you use the full[CR]optimization patch with lag reduction?[CR]I didnt feel like it was in the[CR]spirit of the game I wanted Next Loop to be. I wanted it to play like Mega Man[CR]6, lag and all, so that speedruns had to account for it. Quick screen[CR]scrolling, menus, and health fills make it a better speedgame, but I think lag[CR]reduction as a speedrun strategy is an interesting part of running NES Mega[CR]Man, so I left it in. I still like running hacks with lag reduced[CR]though.[CR]----------------[CR] SPECIAL THANKS[CR]----------------[CR]&gt;[CR]RaidenTheQuick - for helping me find a lot of ROM values to play with.

    <plot>Designed to be a somewhat harder extra game or "next loop" for Mega Man 6,[CR]this hack features new level layouts, different boss weaknesses and arenas,[CR]faster screen loads and menus, and a brand new, unarguably different plot from[CR]the original game. This hack was built with speedrunning in mind for MM6[CR]experts, but it should be accessible for most casual players as well. The[CR]readme includes an FAQ section if anything in the game is confusing. Intended[CR]for the US version of the game.[CR]Read[CR]Me:[CR]-------------------------[CR]Mega Man 6 Next Loop[CR]v1.2[CR]-------------------------[CR]by BaronHaynes[CR]Twitch:[CR]http://www.twitch.tv/baronhaynes[CR]Twitter:[CR]http://www.twitter.com/baronhaynes[CR]Thanks for playing my hack! [CR]Next[CR]Loop started as a Hard Mode hack in the style of Mega Man 9 or 10, with the[CR]same room layout but extra enemies and more pits. I got more ambitious as I[CR]went, learning how to edit more things, and even starting to change stage[CR]layouts a bit toward the end of the game. Its now more of an Extra Game or[CR]direct sequel style of hack, a Mega Man 6.5 or Mega Man 6 Part 2. [CR]My[CR]approach in designing stages and placing enemies was two-fold: Make something[CR]enjoyable and challenging for casual players wholl likely only play it once,[CR]but also facilitate a good speedrun for Mega Man 6 experts. Many screens are[CR]designed to be a lot of fun to do in an efficient way with specific weapons. I[CR]designed some sections knowing they could be trivialized or even bypassed by[CR]an experienced player. Others I tried to make cheese-proof. Overall, I tried[CR]to made a very good speedgame that doesnt lose anything as a casual[CR]game.[CR]Since 1.0, Ive fixed a hardlock issue involving ladders and smoothed[CR]out a couple of unfair sections throughout the game to make it more[CR]accessible. I dont have any current plans to update this hack unless a major[CR]problem or softlock is found, but its possible Ill come back and add some of[CR]the alternate paths back in (several were sealed off to help me finish the[CR]game faster).[CR]I used Mega FLE X for the stage editing and Tile Layer Pro[CR]for some of the graphical changes.[CR]I used FCEUX 2.2.2 to find a lot[CR]information and change things like boss weaknesses and other in-game values[CR]with its hex editor.[CR]--------------[CR]INSTALLATION[CR]--------------[CR]Use a program like LunarIPS to append the[CR].ips file to a Mega Man 6 (not Rockman 6)[CR]rom.[CR]http://fusoya.eludevisibility.org/lips/[CR]Use the standard version if[CR]you want original Mega Man 6 physics.[CR]Use the slidejump version if you want[CR]to be able to jump out of slides.[CR]It was designed with the original physics[CR]in mind, especially for speedrunning, so allowing for slidejumps makes it a[CR]very different experience.

    <plot>This hack replaces Metroid's password system with a saving system, offering[CR]three save files. The file selection menu shows the player's equipment, and as[CR]an added bonus, the player's health is now saved (no need to grind for health[CR]every time you resume your game). The save system can be a handy addition for[CR]those who don't like to use save-states, or those playing on a flash-cart.[CR]Included is a scrollable map when the game is paused and the ability to[CR]combine wave and ice beams. Version 0.3 fixes a bug that could prevent the[CR]game from booting correctly in some cases. The hack has been tested and[CR]confirmed to work on the PowerPak as well as a normal cart.[CR]Read[CR]Me:[CR]Metroid + Saving ( + Map + Wavy-Ice) 0.3[CR]by snarfblam[CR]Whats New[CR]In 0.3?[CR]------ --- -- ---[CR]Version 0.3 fixes a bug that could prevent the[CR]game from booting correctly, especially with a PowerPak. (Thanks to TheFox and[CR]bunnyboy for help fixing it.)[CR]What Does It Do?[CR]---- ---- --[CR]--[CR]Metroid + Saving adds a saving feature to Metroid, similar to that of[CR]Zelda or the FDS version of Metroid, but sexier. There is also a scrollable[CR]minimap displayed when the game is paused. Ice and wave beams are no long[CR]mutually exclusive. Aquire both and youll have a more powerful ice beam that[CR]waves and goes through walls.[CR]How Do I Use It?[CR]--- -- - --- --[CR]Use an[CR]IPS patcher such as Lunar IPS (LIPS) to apply the patch to an original,[CR]unmodified ROM. If you have a problem, verify your ROM. The PRG ROM CRC32 is[CR]70080810. The file MD5 is B2D2D9ED68B3E5E0D29053EA525BD37C, though due to[CR]header variations, a perfectly valid ROM may not produce the same[CR]MD5.[CR]Assembling The Source[CR]---------- --- ------[CR]The source code is[CR]in the "source" folder. The main file is "Metroid Plus.asm". This file is[CR]meant to be assembled with snarfblASM and applied to a ROM expanded with[CR]Editroid. Details are included in "Metroid Plus.asm".

(Please dont ask[CR]me for help getting one.. youll [CR]need to locate it yourself, sorry.)[CR]To[CR]apply the patch, go to any website with ROM hacking utilities[CR](www.zophar.net , www.romhacking.org , www.cg-games.net , etc.) [CR]and[CR]grab an IPS patcher. The favorite seems to be SNESTOOL for DOS, [CR]but theres[CR]stuff like WinIPS as well. Just follow the directions [CR]that come with the[CR]program. For SNESTOOL, select "use IPS", navigate [CR]the directories with the[CR]arrow keys, select the patch, then select the [CR]ROM. Couldnt be simpler. Its[CR]easiest to first put the IPS file and [CR]the Metroid ROM in the SNESTOOL[CR]directory. And you may want to back up [CR]your ROM first.. in case you ever[CR]want to play the original again.[CR]If you still need more information, visit:[CR]http://www.zophar.net/trans/ipsfaq.html[CR]Thanks and enjoy,[CR]--[CR]defgav[CR][somedont@excite.com]&lt;\---- feedback is welcome[CR] 1/16/03</plot>

[CR]The[CR]remaining 10% of items are either out the open to collect or are watched over[CR]by Toad.[CR]To be completely safe..just shoot all destruct-able blocks and you[CR]will get all the items. [CR]There are 10 missile packs and 6 energy tanks to[CR]collect. The map layout is very linear. Unlike Metroid games, [CR]this game[CR]requires virtually zero backtracking. I count literally only 5 times in which[CR]you must travel backwards [CR]after having collected an item and hit a dead-[CR]end. You should really never be lost. Frustration is kept to[CR]a minimum..in[CR]that regard at least. [CR]You find the wave beam very early on and use it for[CR]most of the game. You must switch over to the Vine Beam(ice beam) when[CR]leaving the 4th area(Birdos Lair) to survive in the last area.[CR]Also,[CR]exactly 1 item is optional..the Varia Suit. It is located in the 4th[CR]area(Birdos Lair) and can be skipped [CR]easily actually. If you find that you[CR]have gotten to the elevator and Vine beam and have NOT received[CR]the Varia[CR]Suit..then if you choose to, you can go back to get it.(There should have been[CR]a fork in the road [CR]not too far back, just take the other side.)[CR] 3.[CR]Gameplay tips and strategy:[CR]IMPORTANT TIP #1: In vertically scrolling[CR]rooms, remember that Samus wraps around from left to right and vise versa[CR]when leaving the screen. A lot of obstacles can only be passed if you move[CR]off screen and appear on the other side. [CR]IMPORTANT TIP #2: This wrapping[CR]effect holds true for horizontally scrolling rooms as well. Only the wrapping[CR]occurs from top to bottom and bottom to top. Doing this is not advisable[CR]though. When wrapping in this manner [CR]Samus loses health as if she were in[CR]lava. This technique is used exactly once late in the game and it should[CR]be[CR]obvious when needed. (Brown Toad is present when this technique is[CR]required)[CR]IMPORTANT TIP #3: DO NOT, I REPEAT, DO NOT LEAVE THE 2nd AREA[CR]WITHOUT KILLING BOTH MOUSERS (Real and fake).[CR]Like in the original Metroid,[CR]both bosses (Mouser and Birdo)need to be killed to advance into the last area.[CR]But, you cannot return to the 2nd area after leaving it. You will be[CR]forced to restart your game if you do not[CR]heed this warning. The other boss[CR]is unavoidable so no warning is needed.[CR]TIP #4: In the very first room you[CR]begin the game at, destroy those blocks to reveal your first item. It[CR]will[CR]make the first area a lot easier.[CR]TIP #5: You will come across many[CR]re-spawning enemies. You keep killing em, they keep coming. The best way[CR]to[CR]get by these enemies is to kill them until they drop a health or missle.[CR]As long as you dont collect the health [CR]or missle, the enemy will not come[CR]back and you can cross safely. [CR]TIP #6: If you find yourself having a hard[CR]time jumping out of lava, remember that if you let Samus sink to the[CR]bottom, then jump, she will jump much higher. [CR]TIP #7: Be aware that[CR]there is a limit to the amount of blocks that can be destroyed at a time. Only[CR]11 blocks [CR]can be destroyed at a time. You must wait until the blocks[CR]respawn before you can destroy a new set of blocks.[CR]TIP #8: Samus is[CR]invincable when a bomb is "exploding". A glitch from the original game lets[CR]Samus go unscathed [CR]for the duration of a bombs explosion. It can allow you[CR]too pass thru enemies while taking no damage. Samus also [CR]cannot collect[CR]health or missles during this duration.[CR]TIP #9: If you find yourself with[CR]too little energy to face the final showdown, remember that those flying[CR]enemies[CR]drop health+40s. They re-spawn when you leave the screen and can be[CR]taken down easily if you are smart about it.[CR] 4. Bomb Technique:[CR]This[CR]game is heavy with morphball/bomb puzzles. To make your life easier, I have[CR]documented some specific [CR]techniques to allow you to get thru most puzzles[CR]with ease. [CR]NOTE: These are diagrams for traveling left to right.[CR]#1[CR] ___[CR]___|[CR]To jump over 1 block, morph, and place 1 bomb[CR]#2 [CR]___[CR] |[CR]___|[CR]To jump over 2 blocks, lay a bomb as soon as you morph,[CR]the bomb should hover slightly above ground and propel [CR]you 2 blocks[CR]high[CR]#3[CR]__________[CR]___ ____[CR] | |[CR]To jump over a gap with a[CR]ceiling, lay a bomb as close to the edge as possible,and begin to move as the[CR]bomb explodes[CR]#4 |[CR]___| |____ |___[CR]___ ____ or ____ ___[CR] | | |[CR]|[CR]To jump over a gap with a gap in the ceiling as well, lay a bomb as close[CR]to the edge as possible, [CR]and begin to move a bit before the bomb explodes,[CR]as you begin to fall down the gap, the explosion will actually [CR]lift you up[CR]and into the opening.[CR]#5[CR] |[CR] |_____ [CR] _____ [CR]_____ |[CR] |[CR]|[CR]To jump over a gap and up 1 block, lay a bomb as soon as you morph AND as[CR]close to the edge as possible,[CR] begin to move slightly before the bomb[CR]explodes to be propelled into the opening.[CR]#6[CR] _____[CR] ____ |[CR] |[CR]|[CR] | or |[CR]____| _____|[CR]To jump 3 or 4 block, lay 1 bomb on the floor,[CR]right before it explodes, lay a second bomb on the floor, when the[CR]first[CR]bomb explodes lay a third bomb at the apex of your jump. When you fall, the[CR]second bomb should explode you[CR]into the third bombs explosion and send you[CR]up 3 or 4 blocks. (You may have to press B multiple times to lay that[CR]3rd[CR]bomb in the air)[CR]More often that not though, the easiest way to get up and[CR]over most obstacles is to press the "B" button...and [CR]leave it pressed,[CR]eventually youll make it.[CR] 5. Issues:[CR]Sometimes When falling down a long[CR]vertical shaft, the palette may suddenly appear wrong. It has to do with the[CR]way the game loads rooms and palettes. If you move from room to room[CR]rapidly (fallind down a long shaft) it does[CR]not load those palettes[CR]correctly. It should correct itself when a new room loads.[CR]Do not try to go[CR]"under doors." In few horizontally scrolling rooms, it is possible to fall[CR]into lava and wade [CR]yourself under a door. This will scroll you across to[CR]the next room but will screw up Samus. You will be unable [CR]to advance. Its[CR]nothing that can happen on accident, so if you dont try to cheat or try[CR]anything funny, there [CR]should be no problems.[CR]Pipe Door palettes arent[CR]winning any beauty contests any time soon. Later on when you collect the Varia[CR]Suit, [CR]door colors can get a little funky, just a little limitation of Nes[CR]palettes. [CR]And the special present looks not so special in motion.. :)[CR] 6. How to Play:[CR] [CR] In the zip file you downloaded from either[CR]http://www.freewebs.com/digitalspace/[CR] or http://www.romhacking.net/[CR]there should be 2 files: MetroidWartsinvasion.ips[CR] [CR] and this[CR]Readme.txt[CR] Using a file patcher program, patch the ips file to a clean[CR]Metroid(U).nes rom [CR] [CR] You can get a simple to use file patcher program[CR]here: http://fusoya.panicus.org/lips/index.html[CR] and a great NES emulator[CR]here: http://www.zophar.net/nes.html[CR] I hope you enjoy my hack, feedback is[CR]greatly appreciated as well.[CR] [CR] 7. Special Thanks: [CR]Without the help[CR]of these friendly and talented people, this hack would not exist.[CR]Dudeman[CR]Kirk Bradford Myers[CR]VL-Tone[CR]Dragonsbrethren[CR]and SnowBro for[CR]creating the excellent MetEdit.[CR] Thats one thorough read me file :)</plot>

    <plot>From the author: "This is a 100% complete patch: Most of the map was totally[CR]deleted so the game was built again from scratch. Items are moved, puzzles are[CR]changed, and there is no such thing as a dead end. It is hard both mentally[CR]and physically, but I avoided such design flaws as having to bomb arbitrary[CR]points in the floor or placing enemies so that you get smacked in the face on[CR]the way in or out of rooms. Metroid fans should love this! It's essentially a[CR]brand new NES Metroid game. Also, minor text and graphics hacks were done, but[CR]mostly just for packaging purposes, (As in, the title screen was changed,[CR]mostly). If you like Metroid at all, you should pick this up!" This is a[CR]really fun hack, give it a try.[CR]Read Me:[CR]Metroid Deluxe Beta[CR]v.1.1[CR]Hack performed by The Rooser, (Andrew Emmott)[CR]E-Mail:[CR]rooser2081@netscape.net[CR]Gigantic tip of the hat:[CR] SnoBro (Kent Hansen)[CR]for making Metedit, Hexposure AND Tile[CR]Layer Pro all of which were used in[CR]editing. SnoBro is the reason[CR]there is even a ROMHacking scene! w00t to[CR]SnoBro! w00000000t![CR] [CR]After some positive feedback, some beta-testing,[CR]and the illustrious[CR]Kenclops offering to build and host a Deluxe Games[CR]website, I did some[CR]final tweaking, and spruced up the presentation. For[CR]the time being,[CR]this is the final version of this hack. Im devoting my ROM[CR]Hacking[CR]time to a Mario 3 hack now.[CR]The Deluxe Games philosophy:[CR] To[CR]create detailed, original level hacks that offer entirely[CR]new scenarios.[CR]The idea is to keep the engine and graphics of the game[CR]nearly the same,[CR]just offer new levels, almost as if it were a sequel[CR]to the original game.[CR]Too many levels hacks, (Especially MARIO level[CR]hacks), Are either sloppy[CR]and unprofessional looking, tied too closely[CR]to the original structure of[CR]the game, or in many cases both. The goal[CR]of Deluxe Games is to produce a[CR]hack that looks like something the[CR]original designers might release, but[CR]also a hack that offers entirely[CR]new levels, not just a series of levels[CR]that look like heavily modified[CR]versions of the original.[CR]Whats[CR]here:[CR] A total redesign of the original Metroid game. The rooms[CR]are[CR]reorganized, the items are moved, and it is for all intents[CR]and[CR]purposes a brand-new metroid game. I also did some very minor[CR]graphics[CR]and text editing, mostly just for packaging purposes, but I did[CR]have[CR]fun altering the way the bombs and lava look for craps and[CR]chortles.[CR] My design philosophy was to create something challenging[CR]both[CR]mentally and in the button mashing sense. However, I strayed from[CR]some[CR]of the original design ideas, such as:[CR] 1) You do NOT have to bomb[CR]arbitrary points in the[CR] floor. This sort of thing is irritating and[CR]rewards[CR] the persistent, not the problem-solving. The puzzles[CR] in this[CR]hack are actual puzzles.[CR] 2) Although sometimes impossible, I made an[CR]effort to[CR] prevent the ol "airlock deathtrap" thing from[CR] happening[CR]where you helplessly get bombarded by[CR] fireballs or things that go buzz.[CR]Also, I tried to[CR] place enemies so you would never get slapped in the[CR]face upon entering a room. You can always bring this[CR] crap on yourself[CR]though, so dont come crying to me[CR] when it happens.[CR] With these things[CR]said, dont think this is going to be easy.[CR]To apply the patch:[CR] For the[CR]ease of my audience, (Well actually, its because[CR]Kenclops said I had to,[CR]and Kenclops gives me free webspace, so I obey[CR]him), the patch is in[CR]ips.exe format, which means you the player have[CR]no need for an ips patcher.[CR]Just make sure you have a copy of the ROM,[CR](Do make a copy, you dont want[CR]to lose your original!), and name it[CR]the same as the ips.exe file, just[CR]with the nes extension instead,[CR](In this case "metdeluxe.nes"), and then[CR]run the ips.exe and the rest[CR]should explain itself.[CR]Also included:[CR] I[CR]included the file "metdeluxe.map" so you can look at the ROM[CR]in Metedit, if[CR]you have it, without the zones getting all garbled.[CR]However, as the[CR]designer of this hack, I urge you against using this[CR]to cheat. Play through[CR]the game first before you get hints by looking[CR]at the map. In a future[CR]release I might include a brief walkthrough[CR]for those who get really[CR]stuck.[CR]What I request of you:[CR] You, the happy ROM Hack player, can help[CR]me make this a better[CR]hack by essentially volunteering as a beta tester and[CR]sending me any[CR]criticism or suggestions you may have for the hack. All[CR]those who[CR]oblige will be given credit in this very read me! (Small[CR]potatoes,[CR]I know, but you arent paying any money for this stuff and Im[CR]not[CR]making any either).[CR]Additional tips of the hat:[CR] CakeorDeath?[CR](Jason Salomone)[CR] Kenclops[CR]Thanks for reading and double-thanks for[CR]playing![CR]-Andrew "Rooser" Emmott</plot>

At the time I really was into hacking, and Megaman hacking to[CR]be exact. I thought the ponies were a great concept for a Megaman hack, so I[CR]started working on the first stage, Snakeman/Fluttershy. [CR]I wanted to make[CR]sure to find the right games to rip graphics from, to fit each boss. (You[CR]might be asking why Trixie lives in a factory from Chip and Dale 2, well I[CR]always imagined her hiding in some Laboratory of magical experiments or[CR]something to create new tricks and whatnot)[CR]At first I was planning to make[CR]this a MLP - Megaman crossover with Wily using a device to travel to different[CR]universes and ending up trying to conquer the pony world with Robot copies[CR](All the bosses were supposed to have a metallic look)[CR]But since Season 2[CR]of the show had a pretty "badass" villain for a cartoon like that, I decided[CR]to drop the crossover idea and wipe out all the connections to Megaman story-[CR]wise.[CR]And...thats about it for the desing really, I have no idea which[CR]stage was the second or the third one... What I know for sure is that the[CR]music was a pain in the ass. I had two summers during development and thats[CR]when I was working on the music, because a single song took hours and hours[CR]and hours to be implemented, IF I was paying enough attention to what I was[CR]doing and didnt screw up any of the data pointers or the sequence data bytes.[CR]"Translating" every single note and effect from the famitracker window into[CR]hex, using an .xls table file day and night was literally hell. [CR]I rewrote[CR]about 20kB of data by hand for the music, and thats not counting all the songs[CR]that I later decided to replace, so altogether it was probably about 30kB if[CR]not more. Some of the tracks I actually regret having replaced. The was going[CR]to be a Mystic cave zone music, and Banjo-Kazooie music too. Theres also an[CR]unused song still in the hack, but Im not going to spoil what it is. If youre[CR]having a really boring day, you might find it yourself with a little looking[CR]around.[CR]Point is, around September 2013, the soundtrack was in its final[CR]state.[CR]I still have dozens upon dozens of backup copies, some of them still[CR]have the old music tracks. You might be able to find them on Youtube or[CR]Soundcloud by the time youre reading this.[CR]It might not be the best hack[CR]there is, but... Im a single person, and I was doing this because it was fun[CR]for me, not because I wanted to try to show something better than Rockman 4 MI[CR]for example. Thats a mission for die-hard programmers, not me.[CR]Thanks for[CR]playing, hope youll enjoy the game, or you might be reading this afterwards,[CR]or not at all![CR]Contacts: None, because I no longer want to be associated[CR]with anything My little Pony, and I also want to give up hacking. Nothing[CR]lasts forever.[CR]November 2011 - January 2014</plot>

    <plot>Pac-Man Xtreme is a ROMhack of the Namco version of Ms. Pac-Man for the[CR]Nintendo NES. Officially released by KaBooM! on September 17 2016, it is much[CR]more than a simple maze/level hack. Pac-Man Xtreme introduces new features,[CR]functions, and selectable options which make playing it a truly unique[CR]experience. Almost every single aspect of the original Ms. Pac-Man game has[CR]been altered... graphics, sounds and music, levels, even gameplay mechanics.[CR]In essence, Pac-Man Xtreme is a new commercial-quality game reprogrammed[CR]around Ms. Pac-Man's engine and is thus virtually unrecognizable from its[CR]predecessor. NEW FEATURES AND FUNCTIONS: * Thirty-two new Stages based on[CR]twenty-eight original maze designs. * Stages arranged into eight distinct[CR]Zones composed of four Levels each. * Seven brand new prizes to chase around[CR]the mazes. * One new prize per four-Level Zone, all appearing at random in[CR]Zone 8. * A distinct "?" graphic in the right-side prize indicator for random[CR]prizes. * Four Stage progression play modes: Linear, Singular, Random A, and[CR]Random B. * Newly designed colorful title screen with loads of selectable game[CR]options. * Begin the game on any Stage desired, from 1-1 all the way to 8-4. *[CR]Three selectable blue-Monster "vanishing mazes" options, like Pac-Man Plus. *[CR]Brand new characters including Pac-Xavier, with classic characters returning.[CR]* Four selectable speed options for Pac-Xavier before the game starts. * Names[CR]for Pac-Xavier and the Monsters displayed on the main title screen. * Choose[CR]to begin the game with as little as one or as many as seven lives. *[CR]Opportunities to earn bonus lives every x20000, x50000, and x80000 points. *[CR]The ability to choose whether or not to earn bonus lives at all. * New status[CR]header above each maze, indicating current Stage and prize value. * New CPU[CR]runtime indicator, alongside the top score and game score indicators. * Only[CR]one free "pause" opportunity per Stage... be resourceful, use it wisely. *[CR]Different Monster AI. Things have changed since the days of yore... *[CR]Monsters' "blue" times lengthened and adjusted for fairness and balance. *[CR]Reprogrammed game code and mazes which utilize vertical tunnels. * Dynamically[CR]varying game difficulty based on player performance per Stage. * Special[CR]barrier pellets which can't be eaten but instead block certain paths. * The[CR]ability for Pac to cast relocation spells upon himself and the Monsters. *[CR]Opportunities to earn new spells by catching both prizes in each Stage. *[CR]Opportunities to earn spells and 2000-point bonuses for perfect Stage clears.[CR]* The ability to save and store spells for later use, up to three. * Begin the[CR]game with as many spells as desired, from none to three. * Energy to cast[CR]spells acquirable via prizes, indicated by a "CAST" light. * Remaining alive[CR]as being a condition for a "Perfect Clear" is selectable. * Complete color and[CR]graphics makeover for all characters and mazes. * Brand new, original twelve-[CR]frame death animation for Pac-Xavier. * Brand new and/or tweaked sound[CR]effects. Every game sound has been changed. * New original start music, unique[CR]and composed exclusively for Pac-Man Xtreme. * Two versions: One regular, and[CR]one optimized for the "PocketNES" emulator.[CR]Read[CR]Me:[CR]===============================================================================[CR]PAC-[CR]MAN XTREME[CR]ReadMe[CR]AUTHOR: KaBooM![CR]WRITTEN AND UPDATED: September 17,[CR]2016[CR]===============================================================================[CR]A refurbishment of the Nintendo Entertainment System game "Ms. Pac-Man"[CR]as[CR]published and distributed by Namco Ltd. and Namco Hometek, Inc.[CR]Refurbished, produced, and distributed by KaBooM! in affiliation[CR]with[CR]KaBooM!

Seal Of[CR]Quality and have thus been thoroughly[CR]playtested by myself and a few select[CR]other individuals and found, to the best[CR]of our knowledge, to be one[CR]hundred percent free of all major errors, snafus,[CR]and bugs. Great care has[CR]been taken, therefore, to assure that the issues[CR]which plaque many similar[CR]ROM refurbishments due to poor coding, bad stage[CR]design, lack of knowledge,[CR]laziness, inattention to detail, and improper[CR]quality control have been[CR]eliminated, and a variety of testing platforms[CR]including several emulators[CR]as well as actual Nintendo Entertainment System[CR]hardware have been employed[CR]in order to better facilitate this process. In[CR]essence, one can play Pac-[CR]Man Xtreme assured and confident that these issues[CR]will not be encountered[CR]thus promoting confidence in their enjoyment of the[CR]game. ROM refurbishment[CR]may only be a part-time hobby for me, but it is a[CR]part-time hobby which I[CR]take very seriously when it comes to producing a[CR]quality product which I[CR]feel is more than capable of standing on its own[CR]amongst other commercially[CR]viable game releases."[CR] "Pac-Man Xtreme comes loaded with several[CR]distinguishing game features, some[CR]of them classic, some of them improved,[CR]and some of them brand new. All of[CR]these are described fully and in greater[CR]detail within the scope of this[CR]documentation. The list of features is as[CR]follows:"[CR]* Thirty-two new Stages based on twenty-eight original maze[CR]designs.[CR]* Stages arranged into eight distinct Zones composed of four[CR]Levels each.[CR]* Seven brand new prizes to chase around the mazes.[CR]* One[CR]new prize per four-Level Zone, all appearing at random in Zone 8.[CR]* A[CR]distinct "?" graphic in the right-side prize indicator for random prizes.[CR]*[CR]Four Stage progression play modes: Linear, Singular, Random A, and Random[CR]B.[CR]* Newly designed colorful title screen with loads of selectable game[CR]options.[CR]* Begin the game on any Stage desired, from 1-1 all the way to[CR]8-4.[CR]* Three selectable blue-Monster "vanishing mazes" options, like Pac-[CR]Man Plus.[CR]* Brand new characters including Pac-Xavier, with classic[CR]characters returning.[CR]* Four selectable speed options for Pac-Xavier before[CR]the game starts.[CR]* Names for Pac-Xavier and the Monsters displayed on the[CR]main title screen.[CR]* Choose to begin the game with as little as one or as[CR]many as seven lives.[CR]* Opportunities to earn bonus lives every x20000,[CR]x50000, and x80000 points.[CR]* The ability to choose whether or not to earn[CR]bonus lives at all.[CR]* New status header above each maze, indicating current[CR]Stage and prize value.[CR]* New CPU runtime indicator, alongside the top score[CR]and game score indicators.[CR]* Only one free "pause" opportunity per Stage...[CR]be resourceful, use it wisely.[CR]* Different Monster AI.

There[CR]are numerous programs on the World Wide Web, including[CR]WinZip and 7-Zip, that[CR]you can use to do this, so go ahead and find[CR]yourself one. (I personally find[CR]it easier to just right-click the folder[CR]and choose the Extract All...[CR]option, but your mileage may vary.) When the[CR]folder is opened, you will find[CR]that it contains five other file folders[CR]within it. A basic description of[CR]these folders as well as their contents[CR]is as follows:"[CR] 1. Pac-Man Xtreme - .IPS Patches - "This folder contains[CR]the .IPS patches to[CR] be applied to the Namco versions, NOT THE[CR] TENGEN[CR]VERSIONS, of the Ms. Pac-Man[CR] .NES ROM files to change them to Pac-Man[CR]Xtreme. You may use a standard IPS[CR] patching program, such as Lunar IPS,[CR]for[CR] this. (Note: The use of IPSWin to patch[CR] these ROMs is, as of this[CR]release, not[CR] recommended, as it has been known to[CR] cause errors in the[CR]patched ROMs.)[CR] There are two different .IPS patches[CR] included here:[CR]Pac-Man Xtreme which is[CR] the standard-issue version, and Pac-Man[CR] Xtreme[CR](PN) which is optimized for use[CR] on Loopys and Flubbas PocketNES[CR]emulator for Gameboy Advance. Please[CR] be sure tp apply these patches to a[CR]good[CR] verified NTSC (U) headered version of[CR] the Namco Ms. Pac-Man .NES[CR]ROM."[CR] 2.

Which is why[CR] I am more than[CR]happy to provide, as an[CR] added courtesy, the correct .TBL files to[CR] use[CR]with Pac-Man Xtreme for this type of[CR] ROMhacking, most likely to be[CR]utilized[CR] with your hex editor of choice.

Pac-Man Xtreme - Font Files - "This folder contains copies[CR]of the four[CR] font files I created to be used in Pac-Man[CR] Xtreme, in the[CR]form of .NES ROM files.[CR] These can be opened up in any graphics[CR] editing[CR]program, such as Tile Layer Pro,[CR] and used in your own .NES ROMhacks, so[CR]feel[CR] free to do so."[CR] 5. Pac-Man Xtreme - Written Documentation - "This[CR]folder contains this[CR] ReadMe file and any and all[CR] associated[CR]documentation[CR] included and distributed within[CR] the Pac-Man Xtreme -[CR]File[CR] Package" folder with all of its[CR] accompanying[CR]materials."[CR]===============================================================================[CR]===============================================================================[CR]POCKETNES[CR]COMPATIBILITY AND[CR]USAGE[CR]-------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Pac-Man Xtremes "PN" version optimized for use on the PocketNES emulator[CR]is[CR]best optimized for proper viewing by performing the following actions in[CR]the[CR]following order:[CR] 1. Once Pac-Man Xtreme has been loaded into[CR]PocketNES and activated on the[CR] Game Boy Advance, activate the settings[CR]menu by pressing the "L" and "R"[CR] buttons at the same time. Scroll to[CR]"Display" and select this by[CR] pressing "A". Set the various settings under[CR]this heading to[CR] "SCALED (w/sprites)" and "No Flicker". Press "L" and "R"[CR]together twice[CR] to escape from this menu.[CR] 2. Holding the "L" button,[CR]press "Select" repeatedly to change the scanline[CR] rendering function in[CR]order to optimize Pac-Man Xtreme for the best,[CR] least distorted view on the[CR]Game Boy Advance. Finding the best setting[CR] has been made easier by the[CR]black-striped "optimization bars" which[CR] appear on either side of the Pac-[CR]Man Xtreme logo on the title screen.[CR] Simply press "L"+"Select" until you[CR]see those stripes vanish, and then[CR] Pac-Man Xtreme will be at the setting[CR]best optimized for playing and[CR] viewing on Game Boy Advance. Be sure to[CR]optimize scanline rendering with[CR] flicker turned off in the previous step,[CR]or the optimization bars may[CR] still appear when theyre not supposed to.[CR]The previous instructions give the best method for achieving best[CR]optimized[CR]fullscreen viewing of Pac-Man Xtreme on the Game Boy Advance[CR]using PocketNES.[CR]However, you may alternately choose to play the game in[CR]the UNSCALED mode with[CR]sprite following, which will make the screen[CR]vertically larger than can fit on[CR]the Game Boy Advances screen but will[CR]sacrifice none of the original graphic[CR]detail and will allow the screen to[CR]scroll vertically in order to follow[CR]Pac-Xaviers movement. In order to[CR]achieve this, bring up the settings menu by[CR]pressing both the "L" and "R"[CR]buttons at the same time, scroll to "Display" and[CR]select this by pressing[CR]"A", then set the display mode under this setting to[CR]"UNSCALED (Auto)"[CR]mode. Press "L" and "R" together twice to escape from this[CR]menu.[CR] In[CR]order for sprite following to work properly it must be set up to do so[CR]when[CR]you first build your PocketNES ROM. The details on how to build[CR]PocketNES[CR]ROMs for use in Game Boy Advance are beyond the scope of this[CR]guide... please[CR]refer to the PocketNES documentation for details on how to[CR]achieve this. When[CR]building your PocketNES ROM using the PocketNES Menu[CR]Maker, use the following[CR]procedures to get sprite following in Pac-Man[CR]Xtreme in "UNSCALED (Auto)" mode[CR]to work properly with PocketNES 9.98:[CR]1. Select the "Pac-Man Xtreme (PN)" game from the "Rom List" menu.[CR] 2.[CR]Check off the box next to the "Follow Memory (32)" option. Then, in the[CR]small bar next to it, type in a value of 98. Finally, click the "OK"[CR]button just below that in order to have the Menu Maker "remember" these[CR]settings.[CR] 3. Build your ROM using the "Make Rom"[CR]button.[CR]===============================================================================[CR]===============================================================================[CR]PRIMARY[CR]BASIC GAME[CR]OBJECTIVES[CR]-------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]As in most Pac-Man style games, the player has two primary objectives...[CR]to[CR]consume all edible pellets and energizers within the current maze to[CR]facilitate[CR]moving through the games Stages, and to score as many points as[CR]possible in[CR]the process.[CR] Pac-Xaviers actions are directly controlled by[CR]using Control Pad 1.[CR](Control Pad 2 is not used during normal[CR]gameplay.)[CR] Four dangerously colored Monsters will roam the Stage of the[CR]game Pac-Xavier[CR]is in, hunting down and attempting to capture him. If any[CR]of the Monsters come[CR]into contact with Pac-Xavier, he will die and lose one[CR]of his remaining lives.[CR]Once Pac-Xavier has exhausted all of his available[CR]lives, the game will end.[CR] Eating one of the flashing energizers within the[CR]maze will cause the[CR]Monsters to return to their original blue weak forms[CR]for a period of time,[CR]allowing Pac-Xavier to turn the tables on his enemies[CR]and eat them, earning[CR]exponentially increasing amounts of bonus points. Any[CR]Monsters whom have been[CR]"chomped" in this manner will lose their bodies,[CR]and their disembodied life[CR]forces, represented by their still-visible eyes,[CR]will return to the Monster Pen[CR]as fast as possible to regenerate new bodies[CR]and resume their pursuit of[CR]Pac-Xavier.[CR] Twice per Stage a bonus prize[CR]will emerge from one of the mazes horizontal[CR]tunnels and begin bouncing[CR]around the maze, later returning to disappear back[CR]into a horizontal[CR]tunnel. If Pac-Xavier manages to capture this prize before it[CR]disappears,[CR]he will earn additional bonus points. Bonus prizes point values[CR]increase in[CR]higher numbered Stages.[CR] The game will continue until all reserve lives[CR]have been exhausted or the[CR]player simply quits the[CR]game.[CR]===============================================================================[CR]===============================================================================[CR]WHAT[CR]MAKES PAC-MAN XTREME[CR]UNIQUE[CR]-------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]--------------------------------------[CR]Game[CR]Stages (Zones And Levels)[CR]--------------------------------------[CR] There[CR]are thirty-two Stages in Pac-Man Xtreme, consisting of eight[CR]Zones[CR]comprised of four Levels each. A "Zone" and corresponding "Level",[CR]when[CR]referenced together as a whole, is referred to as a "Stage". More[CR]details on[CR]the specific Stages (Zones and Levels) encountered in Pac-Man[CR]Xtreme can be[CR]found in the "ZONES, STAGES, AND PRIZE DISTRIBUTION"[CR]section.[CR]--------------------------------------[CR]Prize[CR]Distribution[CR]--------------------------------------[CR] Pac-Man Xtremes[CR]prizes are distributed differently than in other Pac-Man[CR]style games, due[CR]to its new Stage layout described above. Prizes are now[CR]distributed across[CR]full Zones rather than individual Levels, with a new prize[CR]appearing every[CR]four Levels. There are eight Zones in Pac-Man Xtreme and seven[CR]different[CR]prizes. In Zone 8, the Mystery Zone, the prizes that appear within[CR]the[CR]Levels are at random.[CR]--------------------------------------[CR]Four[CR]Different Stage Progression[CR]Modes[CR]--------------------------------------[CR] The player may choose,[CR]when in "START" mode at Pac-Man Xtremes title[CR]screen, to play the game in[CR]one of four different modes: Linear, Singular,[CR]Random A, or Random B, which[CR]determines the manner in which the player[CR]progresses through the games[CR]Stages. Additionally, the player may also[CR]choose which Stage to start the[CR]game on in the Linear, Singular, and Random A[CR]modes. More details can be[CR]found in the "PAC-MAN XTREMES COMTROLS"[CR]section.[CR]--------------------------------------[CR]Selectable Game[CR]Options[CR]--------------------------------------[CR] The player may choose,[CR]when in "OPTION" mode at Pac-Man Xtremes title[CR]screen, to change several[CR]key options which determine the rules and regulations[CR]under which the game[CR]is played: Amount of starting lives, whether bonus lives[CR]are dispensed at[CR]x20000, x50000, and x80000 points or not, amount of starting[CR]spells,[CR]whether or not completing a Stage without dying is necessary to achieve[CR]a[CR]"Perfect Clear", whether or not mazes "vanish" during times when Monsters[CR]are[CR]blue, and Pac-Xaviers overall speed settings. More details can be found[CR]in the[CR]"PAC-MAN XTREMES CONTROLS"[CR]section.[CR]--------------------------------------[CR]Limited Pausing Of The[CR]Game[CR]--------------------------------------[CR] Unlike many NES games,[CR]players may only use the "PAUSE" feature in Pac-Man[CR]Xtreme only once per[CR]individual Stage. The purpose of this is to create balance[CR]and encourage[CR]fair play and also to defeat the "slow motion" feature found on[CR]many[CR]controllers which pause the game repeatedly, yet still allow the player[CR]a[CR]reasonable leniency to pause the game if and when the need arises.[CR]Be[CR]resourceful and use this ability wisely and prudently. (Hint: You may[CR]need it[CR]at times to take a breather to locate stray[CR]pellets.)[CR]--------------------------------------[CR]Different Monster[CR]AI[CR]--------------------------------------[CR] The artificial intelligence[CR]under which the Monsters act in Pac-Man Xtreme[CR]has been altered from Ms.[CR]Pac-Man... therefore, Monsters many often act in ways[CR]that are unexpected[CR]by players of previous Pac-Man style games. Detailed[CR]descriptions of the[CR]Monsters new behavioral tendencies and quirks can be found[CR]in the[CR]supplemental written documentation "Pac-Man Xtreme - Enemy[CR]Monster[CR]Itinerary", included in the "Pac-Man Xtreme - Written[CR]Documentation" folder.[CR]--------------------------------------[CR]Vertical[CR]Tunnels[CR]--------------------------------------[CR] Pac-Man Xtreme contains[CR]new code which allows the engine to fully utilize[CR]maze designs which[CR]feature vertical tunnels, and several Stages within the game[CR]take advantage[CR]of this. Both Pac-Xavier as well as the Monsters are capable of[CR]using these[CR]new passages, and will do so often. Its important to note that[CR]vertical[CR]tunnels are different from typical horizontal ones in several ways.[CR]First,[CR]vertical tunnels will not slow Monsters down like horizontal ones will,[CR]an[CR]important point to note when outrunning aggressive pursuers.[CR]Second,[CR]vertical tunnels are neither capable of producing, swallowing, or[CR]allowing[CR]passage of prizes moving through the mazes, and any prize which[CR]finds itself[CR]heading into a vertical tunnel will immediately reverse course[CR]and go in the[CR]opposite[CR]direction.[CR]--------------------------------------[CR]Variable Performance-[CR]Based Difficulty[CR]--------------------------------------[CR] Ms. Pac-Mans[CR]original difficulty selection switch has been re-utilized as a[CR]dynamic[CR]function of Pac-Man Xtreme which changes the difficulty of the game[CR]on a[CR]per-Stage basis based on the amount of blue Monsters and bonus prizes[CR]the[CR]player is able to collect during a particular Stage, making the game[CR]easier or[CR]harder as a result as the player goes along. The better one does[CR]within a[CR]particular Stage, the harder the game will get on the next one.[CR]The opposite[CR]gameplay mechanic also holds[CR]true.[CR]--------------------------------------[CR]Barrier[CR]Pellets[CR]--------------------------------------[CR] There is a new obstacle[CR]to negotiate within the Stages of Pac-Man Xtreme...[CR]Barrier Pellets. These[CR]harmless yet inedible pellets, distinguishable by their[CR]hollowed-out look,[CR]block certain passages within the mazes and are presented as[CR]a minor[CR]inconvenience and with the purpose of creating confusion. Obviously,[CR]they[CR]do not need to be eaten to clear a Stage as eating them is impossible.[CR]But[CR]be on the lookout for these, keep a cool head, and dont get caught off[CR]guard.[CR]--------------------------------------[CR]New Sound Effects And[CR]Music[CR]--------------------------------------[CR] In an effort to further[CR]set it apart from its predecessor Ms. Pac-Man,[CR]every single sound effect in[CR]Pac-Man Xtreme has been changed or altered from[CR]its original version, and a[CR]few new sound effects have even been added.[CR]Furthermore, the games opening[CR]theme music has been entirely recomposed and[CR]rewritten from scratch into a[CR]brand new song unique to Pac-Man[CR]Xtreme.[CR]--------------------------------------[CR]Perfect Stage Clears[CR]Rewarded[CR]--------------------------------------[CR] Pac-Man Xtreme[CR]encourages the player to achieve what is known as a "Perfect[CR]Clear", that[CR]is, the eating of all four Monsters per energizer eaten as well as[CR]the[CR]eating of both prizes which appear in a Stage, by offering special[CR]rewards[CR]for doing so. Whenever the player manages to do this and then[CR]completes the[CR]Stage, not only will their Spell Cache be refilled to the[CR]maximum amount of the[CR]three spells which they can carry at one time but[CR]they will also earn a nice[CR]fat two-thousand point bonus for their[CR]efforts.[CR]--------------------------------------[CR]Casting Relocation[CR]Spells[CR]--------------------------------------[CR] The granddaddy of all of[CR]the new features which make Pac-Man Xtreme unique.[CR]A new play mechanic has[CR]been introduced which allows the player to cast[CR]relocation spells both on[CR]Pac-Xavier and the Monsters, magically transporting[CR]all of them[CR]simultaneously to more advantageous positions within the maze[CR]depending on[CR]whether the Monsters are blue, dangerously colored, or both at the[CR]same[CR]time. Further details regarding this function can be found in their[CR]own[CR]section "ACQUIRING AND CASTING[CR]SPELLS".[CR]===============================================================================[CR]===============================================================================[CR]ACQUIRING[CR]AND CASTING[CR]SPELLS[CR]-------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]One of Pac-Man Xtremes gameplay aspects which makes it unique is the[CR]ability[CR]of the player to cast relocation spells upon both Pac-Xavier and[CR]the Monsters,[CR]teleporting these characters to more advantageous positions[CR]within the current[CR]Stages maze. Two different catalysts are employed for[CR]this function: The[CR]"Spell Cache" and the players "Inert Energy" represented[CR]by a "CAST" light.[CR]Pressing the "B" button at any time during gameplay will[CR]cause Pac-Xavier to[CR]cast a spell if there are spare spells to cast in the[CR]"Spell Cache" and if[CR]Pac-Xaviers "Inert Energy" is currently full,[CR]represented by a lit "CAST"[CR]light. These spells can be used during gameplay[CR]either offensively or[CR]defensively as the player[CR]chooses.[CR]------------------------------------------[CR]Spell[CR]Cache[CR]------------------------------------------[CR] The "Spell Cache" is[CR]where spare spells are stored during the course of the[CR]game. The number of[CR]spells stored in the "Spell Cache" at any given time[CR]during gameplay are[CR]indicated via the amount of spell graphics present under[CR]the "CAST" light[CR]in the right-side column display.[CR] The player begins the game with a[CR]predetermined amount of spells already in[CR]the "Spell Cache" as determined[CR]by the "SPELLS" option that was set on Pac-Man[CR]Xtremes title screen before[CR]gameplay began.[CR] There are two ways to add spells to the "Spell Cache"[CR]during the game.[CR]Capturing both prizes within a given Stages maze will add[CR]one spell to the[CR]"Spell Cache". Achieving a "Perfect Clear" in any Stage[CR]will refill the[CR]players "Spell Cache" to the maximum capacity.[CR] The[CR]"Spell Cache" is capable of storing up to a maximum of three spells at[CR]any[CR]given time.[CR] Any spells which the player has acquired during the course of[CR]the game cannot[CR]be lost until they are cast and will not disappear when[CR]Pac-Xavier loses a[CR]life. (However, "Inert Energy", as indicated by a lit[CR]"CAST" light, will be[CR]lost assuming that the "CAST" light was lit when Pac-[CR]Xavier died.) Any spells[CR]which reside in the "Spell Cache" when the current[CR]Stages maze is cleared will[CR]be carried over for use into the next Stage.[CR]------------------------------------------[CR]Inert[CR]Energy[CR]------------------------------------------[CR] Stored "Inert Energy"[CR]within Pac-Xavier must be used by the player as an[CR]ignition source to cast[CR]the spells which Pac-Xavier carries.[CR] "Inert Energy" is either "completely[CR]full" or "completely empty", and its[CR]state within Pac-Xavier is indicated[CR]by the "CAST" light in the right-side[CR]status display. Pac-Xavier may cast a[CR]spell whenever the "CAST" light is lit,[CR]assuming he is carrying at least[CR]one spell in the "Spell Cache".[CR] It uses up all of Pac-Xaviers stored[CR]"Inert Energy" to ignite and activate a[CR]single spell.[CR] Each new Pac-[CR]Xavier that is introduced into gameplay either at the beginning[CR]of the game[CR]or after the previous Pac-Xavier has died begins with no "Inert[CR]Energy"[CR]stored up. This must be earned with the limited opportunites available[CR]to[CR]do so during the course of standard gameplay.[CR] Eating any prize bouncing[CR]around the maze will restore Pac-Xaviers "Inert[CR]Energy" to "completely[CR]full", lighting the "CAST" light. "Inert Energy" will[CR]be completely lost[CR]either when Pac-Xavier casts a spell or when Pac-Xavier[CR]loses a life and a[CR]new Pac-Xavier is put into gameplay, causing the "CAST"[CR]light to go[CR]dark.[CR] If Pac-Xavier clears a Stage before expending his "Inert Energy"[CR]reserves by[CR]losing a life or casting a spell, this stored "Inert Energy"[CR]will be carried[CR]over for use into the next[CR]Stage.[CR]------------------------------------------[CR]Results Of Casting[CR]Spells[CR]------------------------------------------[CR] Whenever the player[CR]presses the "B" button and successfully casts a spell on[CR]Pac-Xavier and the[CR]Monsters, the following actions will take place:[CR] 1. One spell will[CR]disappear from Pac-Xaviers "Spell Cache".[CR] 2. Pac-Xaviers "Inert Energy"[CR]used to cast the spell will deplete, turning[CR] off the "CAST" light.[CR] 3.[CR]Pac-Xavier will be teleported to the right side of the passage beneath[CR] the[CR]Monster Pen, heading to the left.[CR] 4. All dangerously colored Monsters who[CR]are not disembodied and/or not[CR] within the protective confines of the[CR]Monster Pen will be teleported to[CR] the four corners of the maze.[CR] 5. All[CR]vulnerable blue Monsters who are not disembodied and/or not within[CR] the[CR]protective confines of the Monster Pen will be teleported to the left[CR] side[CR]of the passage beneath the Monster Pen, headed to the right,[CR] straight[CR]towards Pac-Xavier.[CR] Implemented efficiently, casting spells can be an[CR]effective and advantageous[CR]weapon to use as one sees fit, either[CR]offensively or defensively as the given[CR]situation warrants. Use this[CR]wisely, prudently, and[CR]judiciously.[CR]------------------------------------------[CR]Situations In[CR]Which Spells Are Ineffective[CR]------------------------------------------[CR]Any spell successfully cast by the player will always affect Pac-[CR]Xaviers[CR]position within the maze. However, this is not always the case with[CR]the[CR]Monsters, as there are certain times when spells cast by the player[CR]will not[CR]affect them. The following Monsters will not be affected by spells[CR]when they[CR]are cast:[CR] 1. Those who are entering, leaving, residing in,[CR]and/or anywhere within[CR] and/or touching the inner confines of the Monster[CR]Pen. This area is[CR] magically shielded against the effects of spells and is[CR]therefore a safe[CR] haven for all Monsters.[CR] 2. Those who have been eaten[CR]by Pac-Xavier but whom have not yet returned to[CR] the Monster Pen to restore[CR]themselves from being[CR]disembodied.[CR]------------------------------------------[CR]One Last Thing[CR]To Note[CR]------------------------------------------[CR] It is sometimes[CR]possible during the course of the game to end up with either[CR]only spells in[CR]the "Spell Cache" or only the "Inert Energy" needed to cast[CR]these spells[CR]rather than having both at the same time, rendering the player[CR]incapable of[CR]casting a spell until this situation is[CR]remedied.[CR]===============================================================================[CR]===============================================================================[CR]PAC-[CR]MAN XTREMES[CR]CONTROLS[CR]-------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]------------------------------------[CR]------------------------------------[CR]CONTROLLER 1 CONTROLLER 1[CR]("START"[CR]MODE, TITLE SCREEN) ("OPTION" MODE, TITLE[CR]SCREEN)[CR]------------------------------------[CR]------------------------------------[CR]Left/Right - Selects "START" or[CR]Left/Right - Selects "START" or[CR] "OPTION" mode.

    <plot>Pac-Man Xtreme is a ROMhack of the Namco version of Ms. Pac-Man for the[CR]Nintendo NES. Officially released by KaBooM! on September 17 2016, it is much[CR]more than a simple maze/level hack. Pac-Man Xtreme introduces new features,[CR]functions, and selectable options which make playing it a truly unique[CR]experience. Almost every single aspect of the original Ms. Pac-Man game has[CR]been altered... graphics, sounds and music, levels, even gameplay mechanics.[CR]In essence, Pac-Man Xtreme is a new commercial-quality game reprogrammed[CR]around Ms. Pac-Man's engine and is thus virtually unrecognizable from its[CR]predecessor. NEW FEATURES AND FUNCTIONS: * Thirty-two new Stages based on[CR]twenty-eight original maze designs. * Stages arranged into eight distinct[CR]Zones composed of four Levels each. * Seven brand new prizes to chase around[CR]the mazes. * One new prize per four-Level Zone, all appearing at random in[CR]Zone 8. * A distinct "?" graphic in the right-side prize indicator for random[CR]prizes. * Four Stage progression play modes: Linear, Singular, Random A, and[CR]Random B. * Newly designed colorful title screen with loads of selectable game[CR]options. * Begin the game on any Stage desired, from 1-1 all the way to 8-4. *[CR]Three selectable blue-Monster "vanishing mazes" options, like Pac-Man Plus. *[CR]Brand new characters including Pac-Xavier, with classic characters returning.[CR]* Four selectable speed options for Pac-Xavier before the game starts. * Names[CR]for Pac-Xavier and the Monsters displayed on the main title screen. * Choose[CR]to begin the game with as little as one or as many as seven lives. *[CR]Opportunities to earn bonus lives every x20000, x50000, and x80000 points. *[CR]The ability to choose whether or not to earn bonus lives at all. * New status[CR]header above each maze, indicating current Stage and prize value. * New CPU[CR]runtime indicator, alongside the top score and game score indicators. * Only[CR]one free "pause" opportunity per Stage... be resourceful, use it wisely. *[CR]Different Monster AI. Things have changed since the days of yore... *[CR]Monsters' "blue" times lengthened and adjusted for fairness and balance. *[CR]Reprogrammed game code and mazes which utilize vertical tunnels. * Dynamically[CR]varying game difficulty based on player performance per Stage. * Special[CR]barrier pellets which can't be eaten but instead block certain paths. * The[CR]ability for Pac to cast relocation spells upon himself and the Monsters. *[CR]Opportunities to earn new spells by catching both prizes in each Stage. *[CR]Opportunities to earn spells and 2000-point bonuses for perfect Stage clears.[CR]* The ability to save and store spells for later use, up to three. * Begin the[CR]game with as many spells as desired, from none to three. * Energy to cast[CR]spells acquirable via prizes, indicated by a "CAST" light. * Remaining alive[CR]as being a condition for a "Perfect Clear" is selectable. * Complete color and[CR]graphics makeover for all characters and mazes. * Brand new, original twelve-[CR]frame death animation for Pac-Xavier. * Brand new and/or tweaked sound[CR]effects. Every game sound has been changed. * New original start music, unique[CR]and composed exclusively for Pac-Man Xtreme. * Two versions: One regular, and[CR]one optimized for the "PocketNES" emulator.[CR]Read[CR]Me:[CR]===============================================================================[CR]PAC-[CR]MAN XTREME[CR]ReadMe[CR]AUTHOR: KaBooM![CR]WRITTEN AND UPDATED: September 17,[CR]2016[CR]===============================================================================[CR]A refurbishment of the Nintendo Entertainment System game "Ms. Pac-Man"[CR]as[CR]published and distributed by Namco Ltd. and Namco Hometek, Inc.[CR]Refurbished, produced, and distributed by KaBooM! in affiliation[CR]with[CR]KaBooM!

Seal Of[CR]Quality and have thus been thoroughly[CR]playtested by myself and a few select[CR]other individuals and found, to the best[CR]of our knowledge, to be one[CR]hundred percent free of all major errors, snafus,[CR]and bugs. Great care has[CR]been taken, therefore, to assure that the issues[CR]which plaque many similar[CR]ROM refurbishments due to poor coding, bad stage[CR]design, lack of knowledge,[CR]laziness, inattention to detail, and improper[CR]quality control have been[CR]eliminated, and a variety of testing platforms[CR]including several emulators[CR]as well as actual Nintendo Entertainment System[CR]hardware have been employed[CR]in order to better facilitate this process. In[CR]essence, one can play Pac-[CR]Man Xtreme assured and confident that these issues[CR]will not be encountered[CR]thus promoting confidence in their enjoyment of the[CR]game. ROM refurbishment[CR]may only be a part-time hobby for me, but it is a[CR]part-time hobby which I[CR]take very seriously when it comes to producing a[CR]quality product which I[CR]feel is more than capable of standing on its own[CR]amongst other commercially[CR]viable game releases."[CR] "Pac-Man Xtreme comes loaded with several[CR]distinguishing game features, some[CR]of them classic, some of them improved,[CR]and some of them brand new. All of[CR]these are described fully and in greater[CR]detail within the scope of this[CR]documentation. The list of features is as[CR]follows:"[CR]* Thirty-two new Stages based on twenty-eight original maze[CR]designs.[CR]* Stages arranged into eight distinct Zones composed of four[CR]Levels each.[CR]* Seven brand new prizes to chase around the mazes.[CR]* One[CR]new prize per four-Level Zone, all appearing at random in Zone 8.[CR]* A[CR]distinct "?" graphic in the right-side prize indicator for random prizes.[CR]*[CR]Four Stage progression play modes: Linear, Singular, Random A, and Random[CR]B.[CR]* Newly designed colorful title screen with loads of selectable game[CR]options.[CR]* Begin the game on any Stage desired, from 1-1 all the way to[CR]8-4.[CR]* Three selectable blue-Monster "vanishing mazes" options, like Pac-[CR]Man Plus.[CR]* Brand new characters including Pac-Xavier, with classic[CR]characters returning.[CR]* Four selectable speed options for Pac-Xavier before[CR]the game starts.[CR]* Names for Pac-Xavier and the Monsters displayed on the[CR]main title screen.[CR]* Choose to begin the game with as little as one or as[CR]many as seven lives.[CR]* Opportunities to earn bonus lives every x20000,[CR]x50000, and x80000 points.[CR]* The ability to choose whether or not to earn[CR]bonus lives at all.[CR]* New status header above each maze, indicating current[CR]Stage and prize value.[CR]* New CPU runtime indicator, alongside the top score[CR]and game score indicators.[CR]* Only one free "pause" opportunity per Stage...[CR]be resourceful, use it wisely.[CR]* Different Monster AI.

There[CR]are numerous programs on the World Wide Web, including[CR]WinZip and 7-Zip, that[CR]you can use to do this, so go ahead and find[CR]yourself one. (I personally find[CR]it easier to just right-click the folder[CR]and choose the Extract All...[CR]option, but your mileage may vary.) When the[CR]folder is opened, you will find[CR]that it contains five other file folders[CR]within it. A basic description of[CR]these folders as well as their contents[CR]is as follows:"[CR] 1. Pac-Man Xtreme - .IPS Patches - "This folder contains[CR]the .IPS patches to[CR] be applied to the Namco versions, NOT THE[CR] TENGEN[CR]VERSIONS, of the Ms. Pac-Man[CR] .NES ROM files to change them to Pac-Man[CR]Xtreme. You may use a standard IPS[CR] patching program, such as Lunar IPS,[CR]for[CR] this. (Note: The use of IPSWin to patch[CR] these ROMs is, as of this[CR]release, not[CR] recommended, as it has been known to[CR] cause errors in the[CR]patched ROMs.)[CR] There are two different .IPS patches[CR] included here:[CR]Pac-Man Xtreme which is[CR] the standard-issue version, and Pac-Man[CR] Xtreme[CR](PN) which is optimized for use[CR] on Loopys and Flubbas PocketNES[CR]emulator for Gameboy Advance. Please[CR] be sure tp apply these patches to a[CR]good[CR] verified NTSC (U) headered version of[CR] the Namco Ms. Pac-Man .NES[CR]ROM."[CR] 2. Pac-Man Xtreme - .TBL Files - "Are you a ROMhacker who would like[CR]to hack[CR] Pac-Man Xtremes title screen text? As[CR] jumbled around in the[CR]ROM as some of these[CR] alphanumeric symbols now are, this[CR] otherwise[CR]simple task has been made all[CR] the more difficult, unfortunately[CR]stemming[CR] out of matters of efficiency. Which is why[CR] I am more than[CR]happy to provide, as an[CR] added courtesy, the correct .TBL files to[CR] use[CR]with Pac-Man Xtreme for this type of[CR] ROMhacking, most likely to be[CR]utilized[CR] with your hex editor of choice. The details[CR] concerning all[CR].TBL files included with[CR] Pac-Man Xtreme are included in their own[CR]ReadMe file which can be found in the[CR] Pac-Man Xtreme - Written[CR]Documentation[CR] folder. While by no means a definitive[CR] guide to[CR]ROMhacking Pac-Man Xtreme, the[CR] included .TBL files along with their[CR]provided ReadMe file can serve as a step[CR] in the right direction."[CR] 3.[CR]Pac-Man Xtreme - Cartridge Label - "This folder contains a ready-made[CR]label in the form of a printable .BMP[CR] file, color-gamut corrected to[CR]CMYK[CR] standards for maximum color printing[CR] accuracy and sized to the[CR]correct[CR] dimensions used by certain entities[CR] which provide cartridge-[CR]making[CR] services. NESReproductions.com is one[CR] which I highly[CR]recommend."[CR] 5. Pac-Man Xtreme - Font Files - "This folder contains copies[CR]of the four[CR] font files I created to be used in Pac-Man[CR] Xtreme, in the[CR]form of .NES ROM files.[CR] These can be opened up in any graphics[CR] editing[CR]program, such as Tile Layer Pro,[CR] and used in your own .NES ROMhacks, so[CR]feel[CR] free to do so."[CR] 5. Pac-Man Xtreme - Written Documentation - "This[CR]folder contains this[CR] ReadMe file and any and all[CR] associated[CR]documentation[CR] included and distributed within[CR] the Pac-Man Xtreme -[CR]File[CR] Package" folder with all of its[CR] accompanying[CR]materials."[CR]===============================================================================[CR]===============================================================================[CR]POCKETNES[CR]COMPATIBILITY AND[CR]USAGE[CR]-------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Pac-Man Xtremes "PN" version optimized for use on the PocketNES emulator[CR]is[CR]best optimized for proper viewing by performing the following actions in[CR]the[CR]following order:[CR] 1. Once Pac-Man Xtreme has been loaded into[CR]PocketNES and activated on the[CR] Game Boy Advance, activate the settings[CR]menu by pressing the "L" and "R"[CR] buttons at the same time. Scroll to[CR]"Display" and select this by[CR] pressing "A". Set the various settings under[CR]this heading to[CR] "SCALED (w/sprites)" and "No Flicker". Press "L" and "R"[CR]together twice[CR] to escape from this menu.[CR] 2. Holding the "L" button,[CR]press "Select" repeatedly to change the scanline[CR] rendering function in[CR]order to optimize Pac-Man Xtreme for the best,[CR] least distorted view on the[CR]Game Boy Advance. Finding the best setting[CR] has been made easier by the[CR]black-striped "optimization bars" which[CR] appear on either side of the Pac-[CR]Man Xtreme logo on the title screen.[CR] Simply press "L"+"Select" until you[CR]see those stripes vanish, and then[CR] Pac-Man Xtreme will be at the setting[CR]best optimized for playing and[CR] viewing on Game Boy Advance. Be sure to[CR]optimize scanline rendering with[CR] flicker turned off in the previous step,[CR]or the optimization bars may[CR] still appear when theyre not supposed to.[CR]The previous instructions give the best method for achieving best[CR]optimized[CR]fullscreen viewing of Pac-Man Xtreme on the Game Boy Advance[CR]using PocketNES.[CR]However, you may alternately choose to play the game in[CR]the UNSCALED mode with[CR]sprite following, which will make the screen[CR]vertically larger than can fit on[CR]the Game Boy Advances screen but will[CR]sacrifice none of the original graphic[CR]detail and will allow the screen to[CR]scroll vertically in order to follow[CR]Pac-Xaviers movement. In order to[CR]achieve this, bring up the settings menu by[CR]pressing both the "L" and "R"[CR]buttons at the same time, scroll to "Display" and[CR]select this by pressing[CR]"A", then set the display mode under this setting to[CR]"UNSCALED (Auto)"[CR]mode. Press "L" and "R" together twice to escape from this[CR]menu.[CR] In[CR]order for sprite following to work properly it must be set up to do so[CR]when[CR]you first build your PocketNES ROM. The details on how to build[CR]PocketNES[CR]ROMs for use in Game Boy Advance are beyond the scope of this[CR]guide... please[CR]refer to the PocketNES documentation for details on how to[CR]achieve this. When[CR]building your PocketNES ROM using the PocketNES Menu[CR]Maker, use the following[CR]procedures to get sprite following in Pac-Man[CR]Xtreme in "UNSCALED (Auto)" mode[CR]to work properly with PocketNES 9.98:[CR]1. Select the "Pac-Man Xtreme (PN)" game from the "Rom List" menu.[CR] 2.[CR]Check off the box next to the "Follow Memory (32)" option. Then, in the[CR]small bar next to it, type in a value of 98. Finally, click the "OK"[CR]button just below that in order to have the Menu Maker "remember" these[CR]settings.[CR] 3. Build your ROM using the "Make Rom"[CR]button.[CR]===============================================================================[CR]===============================================================================[CR]PRIMARY[CR]BASIC GAME[CR]OBJECTIVES[CR]-------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]As in most Pac-Man style games, the player has two primary objectives...[CR]to[CR]consume all edible pellets and energizers within the current maze to[CR]facilitate[CR]moving through the games Stages, and to score as many points as[CR]possible in[CR]the process.[CR] Pac-Xaviers actions are directly controlled by[CR]using Control Pad 1.[CR](Control Pad 2 is not used during normal[CR]gameplay.)[CR] Four dangerously colored Monsters will roam the Stage of the[CR]game Pac-Xavier[CR]is in, hunting down and attempting to capture him. If any[CR]of the Monsters come[CR]into contact with Pac-Xavier, he will die and lose one[CR]of his remaining lives.[CR]Once Pac-Xavier has exhausted all of his available[CR]lives, the game will end.[CR] Eating one of the flashing energizers within the[CR]maze will cause the[CR]Monsters to return to their original blue weak forms[CR]for a period of time,[CR]allowing Pac-Xavier to turn the tables on his enemies[CR]and eat them, earning[CR]exponentially increasing amounts of bonus points. Any[CR]Monsters whom have been[CR]"chomped" in this manner will lose their bodies,[CR]and their disembodied life[CR]forces, represented by their still-visible eyes,[CR]will return to the Monster Pen[CR]as fast as possible to regenerate new bodies[CR]and resume their pursuit of[CR]Pac-Xavier.[CR] Twice per Stage a bonus prize[CR]will emerge from one of the mazes horizontal[CR]tunnels and begin bouncing[CR]around the maze, later returning to disappear back[CR]into a horizontal[CR]tunnel. If Pac-Xavier manages to capture this prize before it[CR]disappears,[CR]he will earn additional bonus points. Bonus prizes point values[CR]increase in[CR]higher numbered Stages.[CR] The game will continue until all reserve lives[CR]have been exhausted or the[CR]player simply quits the[CR]game.[CR]===============================================================================[CR]===============================================================================[CR]WHAT[CR]MAKES PAC-MAN XTREME[CR]UNIQUE[CR]-------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]--------------------------------------[CR]Game[CR]Stages (Zones And Levels)[CR]--------------------------------------[CR] There[CR]are thirty-two Stages in Pac-Man Xtreme, consisting of eight[CR]Zones[CR]comprised of four Levels each. A "Zone" and corresponding "Level",[CR]when[CR]referenced together as a whole, is referred to as a "Stage". More[CR]details on[CR]the specific Stages (Zones and Levels) encountered in Pac-Man[CR]Xtreme can be[CR]found in the "ZONES, STAGES, AND PRIZE DISTRIBUTION"[CR]section.[CR]--------------------------------------[CR]Prize[CR]Distribution[CR]--------------------------------------[CR] Pac-Man Xtremes[CR]prizes are distributed differently than in other Pac-Man[CR]style games, due[CR]to its new Stage layout described above. Prizes are now[CR]distributed across[CR]full Zones rather than individual Levels, with a new prize[CR]appearing every[CR]four Levels. There are eight Zones in Pac-Man Xtreme and seven[CR]different[CR]prizes. In Zone 8, the Mystery Zone, the prizes that appear within[CR]the[CR]Levels are at random.[CR]--------------------------------------[CR]Four[CR]Different Stage Progression[CR]Modes[CR]--------------------------------------[CR] The player may choose,[CR]when in "START" mode at Pac-Man Xtremes title[CR]screen, to play the game in[CR]one of four different modes: Linear, Singular,[CR]Random A, or Random B, which[CR]determines the manner in which the player[CR]progresses through the games[CR]Stages. Additionally, the player may also[CR]choose which Stage to start the[CR]game on in the Linear, Singular, and Random A[CR]modes. More details can be[CR]found in the "PAC-MAN XTREMES COMTROLS"[CR]section.[CR]--------------------------------------[CR]Selectable Game[CR]Options[CR]--------------------------------------[CR] The player may choose,[CR]when in "OPTION" mode at Pac-Man Xtremes title[CR]screen, to change several[CR]key options which determine the rules and regulations[CR]under which the game[CR]is played: Amount of starting lives, whether bonus lives[CR]are dispensed at[CR]x20000, x50000, and x80000 points or not, amount of starting[CR]spells,[CR]whether or not completing a Stage without dying is necessary to achieve[CR]a[CR]"Perfect Clear", whether or not mazes "vanish" during times when Monsters[CR]are[CR]blue, and Pac-Xaviers overall speed settings. More details can be found[CR]in the[CR]"PAC-MAN XTREMES CONTROLS"[CR]section.[CR]--------------------------------------[CR]Limited Pausing Of The[CR]Game[CR]--------------------------------------[CR] Unlike many NES games,[CR]players may only use the "PAUSE" feature in Pac-Man[CR]Xtreme only once per[CR]individual Stage. The purpose of this is to create balance[CR]and encourage[CR]fair play and also to defeat the "slow motion" feature found on[CR]many[CR]controllers which pause the game repeatedly, yet still allow the player[CR]a[CR]reasonable leniency to pause the game if and when the need arises.[CR]Be[CR]resourceful and use this ability wisely and prudently. (Hint: You may[CR]need it[CR]at times to take a breather to locate stray[CR]pellets.)[CR]--------------------------------------[CR]Different Monster[CR]AI[CR]--------------------------------------[CR] The artificial intelligence[CR]under which the Monsters act in Pac-Man Xtreme[CR]has been altered from Ms.[CR]Pac-Man... therefore, Monsters many often act in ways[CR]that are unexpected[CR]by players of previous Pac-Man style games. Detailed[CR]descriptions of the[CR]Monsters new behavioral tendencies and quirks can be found[CR]in the[CR]supplemental written documentation "Pac-Man Xtreme - Enemy[CR]Monster[CR]Itinerary", included in the "Pac-Man Xtreme - Written[CR]Documentation" folder.[CR]--------------------------------------[CR]Vertical[CR]Tunnels[CR]--------------------------------------[CR] Pac-Man Xtreme contains[CR]new code which allows the engine to fully utilize[CR]maze designs which[CR]feature vertical tunnels, and several Stages within the game[CR]take advantage[CR]of this. Both Pac-Xavier as well as the Monsters are capable of[CR]using these[CR]new passages, and will do so often. Its important to note that[CR]vertical[CR]tunnels are different from typical horizontal ones in several ways.[CR]First,[CR]vertical tunnels will not slow Monsters down like horizontal ones will,[CR]an[CR]important point to note when outrunning aggressive pursuers.[CR]Second,[CR]vertical tunnels are neither capable of producing, swallowing, or[CR]allowing[CR]passage of prizes moving through the mazes, and any prize which[CR]finds itself[CR]heading into a vertical tunnel will immediately reverse course[CR]and go in the[CR]opposite[CR]direction.[CR]--------------------------------------[CR]Variable Performance-[CR]Based Difficulty[CR]--------------------------------------[CR] Ms. Pac-Mans[CR]original difficulty selection switch has been re-utilized as a[CR]dynamic[CR]function of Pac-Man Xtreme which changes the difficulty of the game[CR]on a[CR]per-Stage basis based on the amount of blue Monsters and bonus prizes[CR]the[CR]player is able to collect during a particular Stage, making the game[CR]easier or[CR]harder as a result as the player goes along. The better one does[CR]within a[CR]particular Stage, the harder the game will get on the next one.[CR]The opposite[CR]gameplay mechanic also holds[CR]true.[CR]--------------------------------------[CR]Barrier[CR]Pellets[CR]--------------------------------------[CR] There is a new obstacle[CR]to negotiate within the Stages of Pac-Man Xtreme...[CR]Barrier Pellets. These[CR]harmless yet inedible pellets, distinguishable by their[CR]hollowed-out look,[CR]block certain passages within the mazes and are presented as[CR]a minor[CR]inconvenience and with the purpose of creating confusion. Obviously,[CR]they[CR]do not need to be eaten to clear a Stage as eating them is impossible.[CR]But[CR]be on the lookout for these, keep a cool head, and dont get caught off[CR]guard.[CR]--------------------------------------[CR]New Sound Effects And[CR]Music[CR]--------------------------------------[CR] In an effort to further[CR]set it apart from its predecessor Ms. Pac-Man,[CR]every single sound effect in[CR]Pac-Man Xtreme has been changed or altered from[CR]its original version, and a[CR]few new sound effects have even been added.[CR]Furthermore, the games opening[CR]theme music has been entirely recomposed and[CR]rewritten from scratch into a[CR]brand new song unique to Pac-Man[CR]Xtreme.[CR]--------------------------------------[CR]Perfect Stage Clears[CR]Rewarded[CR]--------------------------------------[CR] Pac-Man Xtreme[CR]encourages the player to achieve what is known as a "Perfect[CR]Clear", that[CR]is, the eating of all four Monsters per energizer eaten as well as[CR]the[CR]eating of both prizes which appear in a Stage, by offering special[CR]rewards[CR]for doing so. Whenever the player manages to do this and then[CR]completes the[CR]Stage, not only will their Spell Cache be refilled to the[CR]maximum amount of the[CR]three spells which they can carry at one time but[CR]they will also earn a nice[CR]fat two-thousand point bonus for their[CR]efforts.[CR]--------------------------------------[CR]Casting Relocation[CR]Spells[CR]--------------------------------------[CR] The granddaddy of all of[CR]the new features which make Pac-Man Xtreme unique.[CR]A new play mechanic has[CR]been introduced which allows the player to cast[CR]relocation spells both on[CR]Pac-Xavier and the Monsters, magically transporting[CR]all of them[CR]simultaneously to more advantageous positions within the maze[CR]depending on[CR]whether the Monsters are blue, dangerously colored, or both at the[CR]same[CR]time. Further details regarding this function can be found in their[CR]own[CR]section "ACQUIRING AND CASTING[CR]SPELLS".[CR]===============================================================================[CR]===============================================================================[CR]ACQUIRING[CR]AND CASTING[CR]SPELLS[CR]-------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]One of Pac-Man Xtremes gameplay aspects which makes it unique is the[CR]ability[CR]of the player to cast relocation spells upon both Pac-Xavier and[CR]the Monsters,[CR]teleporting these characters to more advantageous positions[CR]within the current[CR]Stages maze. Two different catalysts are employed for[CR]this function: The[CR]"Spell Cache" and the players "Inert Energy" represented[CR]by a "CAST" light.[CR]Pressing the "B" button at any time during gameplay will[CR]cause Pac-Xavier to[CR]cast a spell if there are spare spells to cast in the[CR]"Spell Cache" and if[CR]Pac-Xaviers "Inert Energy" is currently full,[CR]represented by a lit "CAST"[CR]light. These spells can be used during gameplay[CR]either offensively or[CR]defensively as the player[CR]chooses.[CR]------------------------------------------[CR]Spell[CR]Cache[CR]------------------------------------------[CR] The "Spell Cache" is[CR]where spare spells are stored during the course of the[CR]game. The number of[CR]spells stored in the "Spell Cache" at any given time[CR]during gameplay are[CR]indicated via the amount of spell graphics present under[CR]the "CAST" light[CR]in the right-side column display.[CR] The player begins the game with a[CR]predetermined amount of spells already in[CR]the "Spell Cache" as determined[CR]by the "SPELLS" option that was set on Pac-Man[CR]Xtremes title screen before[CR]gameplay began.[CR] There are two ways to add spells to the "Spell Cache"[CR]during the game.[CR]Capturing both prizes within a given Stages maze will add[CR]one spell to the[CR]"Spell Cache". Achieving a "Perfect Clear" in any Stage[CR]will refill the[CR]players "Spell Cache" to the maximum capacity.[CR] The[CR]"Spell Cache" is capable of storing up to a maximum of three spells at[CR]any[CR]given time.[CR] Any spells which the player has acquired during the course of[CR]the game cannot[CR]be lost until they are cast and will not disappear when[CR]Pac-Xavier loses a[CR]life. (However, "Inert Energy", as indicated by a lit[CR]"CAST" light, will be[CR]lost assuming that the "CAST" light was lit when Pac-[CR]Xavier died.) Any spells[CR]which reside in the "Spell Cache" when the current[CR]Stages maze is cleared will[CR]be carried over for use into the next Stage.[CR]------------------------------------------[CR]Inert[CR]Energy[CR]------------------------------------------[CR] Stored "Inert Energy"[CR]within Pac-Xavier must be used by the player as an[CR]ignition source to cast[CR]the spells which Pac-Xavier carries.[CR] "Inert Energy" is either "completely[CR]full" or "completely empty", and its[CR]state within Pac-Xavier is indicated[CR]by the "CAST" light in the right-side[CR]status display. Pac-Xavier may cast a[CR]spell whenever the "CAST" light is lit,[CR]assuming he is carrying at least[CR]one spell in the "Spell Cache".[CR] It uses up all of Pac-Xaviers stored[CR]"Inert Energy" to ignite and activate a[CR]single spell.[CR] Each new Pac-[CR]Xavier that is introduced into gameplay either at the beginning[CR]of the game[CR]or after the previous Pac-Xavier has died begins with no "Inert[CR]Energy"[CR]stored up. This must be earned with the limited opportunites available[CR]to[CR]do so during the course of standard gameplay.[CR] Eating any prize bouncing[CR]around the maze will restore Pac-Xaviers "Inert[CR]Energy" to "completely[CR]full", lighting the "CAST" light. "Inert Energy" will[CR]be completely lost[CR]either when Pac-Xavier casts a spell or when Pac-Xavier[CR]loses a life and a[CR]new Pac-Xavier is put into gameplay, causing the "CAST"[CR]light to go[CR]dark.[CR] If Pac-Xavier clears a Stage before expending his "Inert Energy"[CR]reserves by[CR]losing a life or casting a spell, this stored "Inert Energy"[CR]will be carried[CR]over for use into the next[CR]Stage.[CR]------------------------------------------[CR]Results Of Casting[CR]Spells[CR]------------------------------------------[CR] Whenever the player[CR]presses the "B" button and successfully casts a spell on[CR]Pac-Xavier and the[CR]Monsters, the following actions will take place:[CR] 1. One spell will[CR]disappear from Pac-Xaviers "Spell Cache".[CR] 2. Pac-Xaviers "Inert Energy"[CR]used to cast the spell will deplete, turning[CR] off the "CAST" light.[CR] 3.[CR]Pac-Xavier will be teleported to the right side of the passage beneath[CR] the[CR]Monster Pen, heading to the left.[CR] 4. All dangerously colored Monsters who[CR]are not disembodied and/or not[CR] within the protective confines of the[CR]Monster Pen will be teleported to[CR] the four corners of the maze.[CR] 5. All[CR]vulnerable blue Monsters who are not disembodied and/or not within[CR] the[CR]protective confines of the Monster Pen will be teleported to the left[CR] side[CR]of the passage beneath the Monster Pen, headed to the right,[CR] straight[CR]towards Pac-Xavier.[CR] Implemented efficiently, casting spells can be an[CR]effective and advantageous[CR]weapon to use as one sees fit, either[CR]offensively or defensively as the given[CR]situation warrants. Use this[CR]wisely, prudently, and[CR]judiciously.[CR]------------------------------------------[CR]Situations In[CR]Which Spells Are Ineffective[CR]------------------------------------------[CR]Any spell successfully cast by the player will always affect Pac-[CR]Xaviers[CR]position within the maze. However, this is not always the case with[CR]the[CR]Monsters, as there are certain times when spells cast by the player[CR]will not[CR]affect them. The following Monsters will not be affected by spells[CR]when they[CR]are cast:[CR] 1. Those who are entering, leaving, residing in,[CR]and/or anywhere within[CR] and/or touching the inner confines of the Monster[CR]Pen. This area is[CR] magically shielded against the effects of spells and is[CR]therefore a safe[CR] haven for all Monsters.[CR] 2. Those who have been eaten[CR]by Pac-Xavier but whom have not yet returned to[CR] the Monster Pen to restore[CR]themselves from being[CR]disembodied.[CR]------------------------------------------[CR]One Last Thing[CR]To Note[CR]------------------------------------------[CR] It is sometimes[CR]possible during the course of the game to end up with either[CR]only spells in[CR]the "Spell Cache" or only the "Inert Energy" needed to cast[CR]these spells[CR]rather than having both at the same time, rendering the player[CR]incapable of[CR]casting a spell until this situation is[CR]remedied.[CR]===============================================================================[CR]===============================================================================[CR]PAC-[CR]MAN XTREMES[CR]CONTROLS[CR]-------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]------------------------------------[CR]------------------------------------[CR]CONTROLLER 1 CONTROLLER 1[CR]("START"[CR]MODE, TITLE SCREEN) ("OPTION" MODE, TITLE[CR]SCREEN)[CR]------------------------------------[CR]------------------------------------[CR]Left/Right - Selects "START" or[CR]Left/Right - Selects "START" or[CR] "OPTION" mode.

    <plot>Rockman 3 Endless is a recreation of Mega Man 9's Endless Attack mode. It is[CR]an endurance mode; areas are picked at random, you start at a teleporter and[CR]must get to another teleporter at the end of the area.

You start the game with[CR]all of the robot masters' weapons and Rush adapters; your only goal is to[CR]survive for as many screens as possible. A similar hack, by the same creator,[CR]is also available for [Rockman 5](http://www.romhacking.net/hacks/460/). The[CR]version number on this page is based on the time stamp attached to the patch[CR]in the archive, as there is no official version number and the hack is updated[CR]with new areas often.[CR][Dragonsbrethren](http://www.romhacking.net/community/296/) has an archive[CR]site where past versions of the hack can be obtained, which is located[CR][here](http://dragonsbrethren.slickproductions.org/rock3endless.html).</plot>

Rockman 4 BCAS also features new music, level designs and modified[CR]enemy and Robot Master AIs, as well as new weapons.</plot>

    <plot>Made by talented ROM hacker: Puresabe, comes Rockman 4: Minus Infinity. One of[CR]the best ROM hacks that does what others only dream of achieving. The levels,[CR]bosses, weapons and even the choice of music of the original Rockman 4 have[CR]been improved to a level that far exceeds an aesthetic standpoint - bosses[CR]have new attack patterns, weapons and moves (such as the distinguishable[CR]'desperation' moves that speed up the music and make the bosses angrier and[CR]faster). The levels have branching pathways and hidden bosses from past Mega[CR]Man/Rockman games that won't fail to put a smile on your face (such as[CR]Shadowman robbing the Egyptian temple, or Crashman hiding in the weapons[CR]artillery of Drillman's stage), the music is very well chosen from a variety[CR]of different games, and new enemies from earlier and later games in the[CR]franchise, not found in the original Rockman 4, make an already fantastic[CR]piece of programming a platforming masterpiece.

Wii", which was the current Mario platformer[CR]at[CR]the time I started work on this in its infancy. My brother[CR]suggested[CR]"3Mix" instead (a play on the word "remix"), and it stuck.[CR]But[CR]enough of that history, what can we expect? Well:[CR]- All new levels (and a[CR]few "remixed" Mario 3 levels somewhere in there)[CR]- Many new songs added[CR]from other Mario games (kept some SMB3 classics!)[CR]- Play as Mario, Luigi,[CR]or Toad (cosmetic only) in any configuration[CR]- New power-ups (Penguin[CR]replaces Frog, Carrot replaces Tanooki)[CR]- Star Coins (which are used to[CR]unlock portions of the game!)[CR]- Ability to re-enter past worlds (with level[CR]completion intact!)[CR]- Ability to re-enter past levels (to get all of your[CR]Star Coins)[CR]- Alternate exits in some levels[CR]- Ability to save[CR]progress[CR]- Many new enemies, typically some special ones for the world[CR]theme[CR]- All new bosses (many are "remixes" of bosses from other Mario[CR]games)[CR]- All kinds of gameplay changes to meet the theme of a[CR]level/world![CR]Each World carries a theme and often even directly references[CR]another[CR]specific Mario title:[CR]- World 1 is based on the original Super[CR]Mario Bros.[CR]- World 2 is based on Super Mario Bros. 2 (USA)[CR]- World 4 is[CR]based on Super Mario World[CR]- World 6 is based on Super Mario Sunshine[CR]-[CR]World 7 is based on Super Mario Galaxy [CR]World 3 and World 5 are just theme[CR]worlds, and World 8 is set up as a [CR]sort-of "final exam" that tests you on[CR]elements from the previous[CR]worlds.[CR]------------------------------------------[CR]Important info on[CR]some new features[CR]------------------------------------------[CR]While I[CR]dont need to describe ALL the new stuff going on (some of its[CR]obvious, some[CR]of it is just worth experiencing instead of reading it),[CR]I should at least[CR]describe some new and important features in gameplay.[CR]== STAR COINS[CR]==[CR]These should be familiar from later Mario platformer titles. Star[CR]Coins[CR]are star-faced coins that are generally out-of-the-way in levels[CR](often[CR]hidden in bonus areas for example) that are sort of "trophies" for[CR]the[CR]level. Three of these are in every single normal level. For a level[CR]to[CR]be truly "complete", you must find the three Star Coins within[CR]it.[CR]Gathering all of the star coins in all of the levels is the key to[CR]unlocking some parts of the game... good luck![CR]== STAR ROAD ==[CR]"Star[CR]Road" is accessed by pressing START on the World Map and selecting[CR]the menu[CR]option for it. Star Road is basically just a way to access[CR]worlds youve[CR]previously been to so you can come back at another time to[CR]finish finding[CR]Star Coins, alternate exits, etc.[CR]Every time you complete a world, a new[CR]path on Star Road is opened. So[CR]once World 1 is complete, you can visit[CR]Star Road and access either[CR]World 1 or World 2. All level completion data[CR]is retained, so its[CR]completely safe to jump around as you desire. In fact,[CR]if playing a Two[CR]Player game, each player can actually be on a different[CR]world! This may[CR]allow for tag-teaming Star Coin hunting and other[CR]activities.[CR]== SAVE DATA ==[CR]Save data has been added. Data recorded[CR]includes levels completed, Star[CR]Coins collected, item inventory, score,[CR]etc. [CR]There are three save slots available to choose from. Simply select[CR]the[CR]desired slot on the title screen. You can also erase an existing[CR]save[CR]by following the instructions on the title screen.[CR]Saving is[CR](mostly) NOT automatic! If you want to save your game, simply [CR]press START[CR]any time and select either "SAVE and CONTINUE" (writes save[CR]data and[CR]resumes the game) or "SAVE and QUIT" (writes save data and returns[CR]to the[CR]title screen.)[CR]Obviously if you are playing on an emulator with save[CR]states, you[CR]probably dont care much about this feature. However, it is[CR]still [CR]required for progressing through the entire game, so just be aware[CR]that[CR]it exists.[CR]PLAYING ON HARDWARE NOTES: Save data CAN work on a[CR]RetroUSB PowerPak, but[CR](as of this writing, where the current release is[CR]1.34) you need to use[CR]Loopys Mappers in addition to the ones provided on[CR]retrousb.com. Note[CR]that Loopys mappers are a subset of what you get at[CR]RetroUSB, so you[CR]still need the RetroUSB ones as a base and only overwrite[CR]the specific[CR]ones that Loopy replaced. (Very specifically the MMC3 one for[CR]3Mix, but [CR]might as well do them all.) This situation may change with[CR]future [CR]releases from RetroUSB, so try those first![CR]You can get Loopys[CR]Mappers here: http://home.comcast.net/~olimar/NES/[CR]For any device being[CR]used, testing whether or not save data is working [CR]is simple. Start with an[CR]empty slot. Immediately "SAVE and QUIT" from the [CR]world map. The game[CR]should reset and a slot occupied with "W1 *000" [CR]should be displayed.[CR]Follow the procedure appropriate to your device to[CR]commit save data (if[CR]any) and then power off the NES. Power on and follow[CR]any steps to load save[CR]data on the device (if needed) and the game should[CR]start with the same[CR]display of "W1 *000" on the title screen save menu.[CR]For the RetroUSB[CR]PowerPak, the bugged out mapper in release 1.34 will NOT[CR]store the save[CR]data (in fact, it is not storing ANY data), and the title[CR]screen will still[CR]have three "EMPTY" save slots.[CR]An external source has verified that save[CR]data is working on a TKROM board[CR](i.e. Nintendos official cartridge[CR]hardware), so that means the [CR]implementation is correct. If your device or[CR]emulator is not persisting[CR]data, then its the fault of the device or[CR]emulator.[CR]------------------------------------------[CR]Good[CR]luck![CR]------------------------------------------[CR]Hopefully everything[CR]else should be pretty straightforward as you play[CR]the game. For contact[CR]info or to find the Super Mario Bros. 3 disassembly,[CR]use the URL at the top[CR]of this document.[CR]Enjoy!</plot>

    <plot>Super Mario Adventures is a ROM hack of Tiny Toon Adventures. It changes many[CR]of the sprites to Mario universe sprites making the game like a Mario game.[CR]This was done as the game was felt to be highly inspired by the Mario series[CR]in it's gameplay and design. All four characters have been changed to Mario in[CR]differnent forms of Transformations. The story has also been altered to use[CR]President/King Koopa from the SMB movie instead of Montana Max. Other[CR]characters have also been changed to characters found in the Mario universe[CR]such as Peach and Toad.</plot>

    <plot>This hack updates the entire Super Mario Bros. game to match the look of more[CR](relatively) modern Super Mario games, particularly Super Mario World. With[CR]the exception of solid background tiles, every tile has been updated including[CR]enemies and power-ups. However, nothing has been moved or had its behavior[CR]changed, and all of the graphic changes are simply updates (as opposed to[CR]replacements). The changes were originally kept simple so that it could be[CR]used with other level hacks. The Luigi game from YY-CHR has been thrown in[CR]giving the player the choice of using Mario or Luigi (instead of 2 players).[CR]This is the only functional change (improvement) to the game.</plot>

    <plot>Mario decided it was time for a vacation, so he went to the Tofu Kingdom for[CR]some rest and relaxation. One of the sites he was going to visit first was a[CR]famous play where the most beautiful Geisha in all the land performs. When[CR]Mario buys his ticket he notices a big ball of light coming from the sky and[CR]crashes right into the hall where he was going to watch the play. When Mario[CR]arrives at the hall he sees people running out in a panic and some people[CR]already dead in a massacre. When Bowser sees that Mario is at the Tofu Kingdom[CR]he takes the famous Geisha along with her three uncles, and flies away into[CR]the sky. One of her other uncles was lying on the floor and tells Mario that[CR]Bowser has gone into the Exile Valley, he also warns Mario that people who[CR]went there has never returned. So before he dies, he gives Mario a map where[CR]the Valley is located. So now Mario is in a new land, with a new quest, while[CR]he's on vacation... Super Loco Spoof! is a Smb1 hack that was being made while[CR]I was working on my other hacks in progress.

    <plot>Super Loco Spoof! 2 is the sequel to the Super Mario Bros. hack called [Super[CR]Loco Spoof!](http://www.romhacking.net/hacks/140/). This hack was given to[CR]Googie by Rockman (AKA [RetroRain](http://www.romhacking.net/community/2913/))[CR]in case he wanted to finish it. This is the hack that got him motivated to ROM[CR]Hack again. Please read the readme for more information in the zip file.

[CR]------------------------------[CR]I decided to[CR]work on this hack cause I needed a project to motivate me, and this is the[CR]result. Its a 3 world hack, with a few AsM changes Rockman did. like infinite[CR]lives, small jumping SMB1 sound, get 99 coins and you get the star power, and[CR]when youre Super Mario or have a power up you can jump on a note block and do[CR]a flip. There was a poison mushroom but I hadda sacrafice it in order for the[CR]straight fireballs. [CR]There was a nasty bug that couldnt be fixed with the[CR]world 2 airship, if you woulda enter the world 2 airship the game woulda reset[CR]itself and trying to put the original level in there wouldnt fix the bug and[CR]mess up the world 1 airship. So regardless you gotta get the warp whistle in[CR]go to world 3. [CR]--------------------------------[CR]Super Loco Spoof! 2[CR]picks up right after part 1, Bowser got all pissed of and shit and took Peach[CR]away from Mario after he returned from the Tofu Kingdom.

Ain't that nice?[CR]Read[CR]Me:[CR]----------------------------------------------[CR]-The Super Mario[CR]Bros. 2 - Second Run -[CR]----------------------------------------------[CR]This is a hack of the[CR]original SMB2 game with new levels. The idea[CR]behind this hack is that its[CR]the same SMB2 game we all love, but[CR]with entirely new levels. Game[CR]difficulty is easy to moderate but[CR]rises from moderate to nightmare for[CR]worlds 6 and 7. Aint that nice?[CR]If you have suggestions and comments you[CR]can e-mail me at the[CR]following address.[CR]recovery.1@sk.sympatico.ca[CR]If[CR]you request roms, your e-mails will be filed under "G".[CR]Known[CR]bugs:[CR]Doors! You go through some and fall off the top of your[CR]destination[CR]screen. Even Maxs_Evil_Brother couldnt help me figure them all[CR]out,[CR]so I edited in many cases to take this into account.[CR]Theres a[CR]strange bug in 5-1. If you take the potion and return to[CR]the location you[CR]started from, sometimes a door will open when in[CR]subspace that remains when[CR]you return to normal. It leads back a few[CR]worlds.[CR]I also spent some time[CR]restoring the 4 players attributes and[CR]abilities after a bug in the editor[CR]mucks them up every time it[CR]saves. Everything seems normal but if something[CR]is just not right, do[CR]let me know. [CR]- --------------[CR]Thanks[CR]to:[CR]The Great and almighty powerful Acmlm, who created the editor and[CR]has[CR]been putting my hacks on his website.

May I suggest grabbing as[CR]many as you find[CR]if you[CR]arent using save states. After 5-1 there are no more free[CR]lives, very few[CR]coins that can be harvested, and some of the levels[CR]dont even offer[CR]mushrooms past this point.[CR]1-3 if you have Luigi, you can reach the top of[CR]the cloud for the[CR]free 1-up[CR]In 3-3 there is a section of wall that you[CR]can go through to avoid a[CR]few baddies.

    <plot>This is a hack of Super Mario Bros. 3 which changes the levels and boasts a[CR]new story line. Bowser obtained a jewel containing the ultimate power, the[CR]Chaos Control, and Mario has to stop him and save the world once[CR]again.[CR]Read Me:[CR]===============================[CR]Super Mario Bros.[CR]CHAOS CONTROL[CR]===============================[CR]Contents:[CR]-Directions[CR] -Story[CR] -Techniques[CR] -The 8 Worlds[CR]-Credits[CR]===============================[CR]DIRECTIONS[CR]----------[CR] To[CR]get this Rom Hack ready:[CR]-First, make sure you have a normal version of[CR]Super Mario Bros. 3, Rom format, on your hard drive, along with Lunar IPS (an[CR]IPS Patcher) and an emulator. And, of course, you need this IPS file.[CR]-Open[CR]Lunar IPS and patch the file to the Rom.[CR]-Open the Rom in your emulator and[CR]presto, youre ready to play![CR] DO NOT:[CR]-Patch the file to an already[CR]hacked or bad Rom. This will most likely royally screw your poor[CR]Rom.[CR]-Patch to a Rom other than Super Mario Bros. 3. Ditto.[CR]-Hack my[CR]hack. Quite disrespectful! I mean, even if you dont CHANGE anything and just[CR]look around via editor, its still cheating and upsetting to me.[CR]-Sell my[CR]hack. Its FREE, as in Zero-Cash-Necessary free.[CR]I expect you to obey these[CR]requests, as it is, in Schwas words, "The Honorable asset of a fighter". Of[CR]course, youre not a fighter exactly, but Schwas words are still wise. Ah, but[CR]maybe you ARE a fighter...? Ill never know though, will I?[CR];_;[CR]===============================[CR]STORY[CR]-----[CR] "Muhuhahaha! At[CR]last, I have something POWERFUL!" Bowser exclaimed deep within the mines of a[CR]distant land. In his rough hand he held a jewel containing the ultimate[CR]power-- the Chaos Emerald. By the means of a dream Kammy Koopa had one night,[CR]they were able to trace this elusive jewel to its very location underground.[CR]And now that Bowser had near unlimited power at his disposal, he was going to[CR]use it... to crush Mario forever.[CR] Flying back to his homeworld via[CR]Clownmobile (the one he always flies around in), keeping the Emerald safe in a[CR]prism the entire way, Bowser headed back to World 8, Dark Land (or Castle of[CR]Koopa, whichever you prefer) and landed atop his castle. He and Kammy Koopa[CR]stood at the pinnacle, wondering what to do next. Kammy spoke:[CR] "In my[CR]dream, the voice said, This contains the unlimited power of Chaos Control.[CR]Find it. But what would THAT mean?"[CR] Bowser shook his head. "Chaos[CR]Control... Hmm..."[CR] Instantly the green Emerald lit up, emitting a[CR]noticable energy. Bowser laughed. "Okay! I figured it out! Take cover,[CR]Kammy!"[CR] Kammy flew back on her broom about 100 feet or so. Bowser held the[CR]Emerald heavenward and shouted at the top of his lungs, "CHAOS...[CR]CONTROL!!!"[CR] Immensely bright light poured out of the jewel, enveloping[CR]everything as far as the eye could see. And in reality, this light had covered[CR]every square inch of ALL 8 of the Worlds in Mushroom Kingdom! This was Chaos[CR]Control at its strongest.[CR] When the light cleared, World 8 was WAY[CR]different. Instead of a hot, dark, barren-like area, it resembled something[CR]like a twilight universe. Bowser and Kammy were amazed. "Wow! Kammy, lets go[CR]check out the new and improved Mushroom Kingdom!"[CR] They flew across all the[CR]new Worlds, and were amazed further. They were made MUCH harder to travel on[CR]by foot, thats for sure! Bowser had accomplished the feat of transforming[CR]every World through the power of Chaos Control, but he wasnt done.[CR] "Ill[CR]build 7 new Airships and power them with the Emerald. Ill send one Ship out to[CR]the 7 Worlds before mine, piloted by my Koopa Kids. Ill have all the Magic[CR]Wands re-stolen from the 7 Kings, who still dont know what hit them. And this[CR]will lure Mario to his doom! Muhuhahaha!!"[CR] Meanwhile, right after the[CR]light cleared, Princess Peach (who was in Marios house on the outskirts of[CR]World 1) looked out the window... and what she saw was NOT the Grass Land she[CR]was used to, but more like the surface of the moon. (The only difference would[CR]be that it was still daylight over the World they were in, making it look[CR]TRULY weird.) Peach quickly brought Mario to the window, and he was all[CR]"Ooh!"[CR] Peach was worried and didnt know what to do, when news via an[CR]excited Toad reached her informing her that 7 out of 8 Worlds were under[CR]attack by a MASSIVE Battlecruiser.[CR] "Wait a minute... 7 out of 8?" Peach[CR]inquired.[CR] "Thats right! Suspicious, eh? But Ive got to tell the others!"[CR]And the Toad child ran off.[CR] Mario didnt waste any time. "Ooh, no ya dont,[CR]big Bowser! Its-a Marios day!" And ran down the road, en route to the Worlds[CR]Castle. He never noticed that Peach went her own sepearte way after he left[CR]the house...[CR] Can Mario restore the effects of Chaos Control? The only way[CR]to do that would be to win the Emerald back. So good luck, Mario! And Peach,[CR]wherever youve gone off to... Good luck to you,[CR]too.[CR]===============================[CR]TECHNIQUES[CR]----------[CR] The[CR]laws of physics are exactly the same as before in the new Mario 3. Mario can[CR]jump and run, and through those two abilities alone, he can do MANY things.[CR]Most enemies can be beaten by jumping on them, but some cant. The ones that[CR]cant, well... The best way is usually through the Koopa Shell! Stomping a[CR]Koopa makes it hide in its shell, duh, but the shell is a VERY good weapon.[CR]There are two ways to attack via shell:[CR]-Run into the foe and slam it with[CR]the shell, or[CR]-Get close and kick the shell once at eye level.[CR]The pros[CR]and cons to this? The second way is usually more dangerous, as a flying shell[CR]can hurt YOU like anyone else, but it can also hit more than one foe-- in fact[CR]it destroyes any foes it touches. The first way, on the other hand, kills the[CR]shell AND the enemy at the same time. This way the shell wont riccoshe of a[CR]wall and damage you, but it can only be used against one enemy, rather than[CR]many.[CR] The Pow Block, in this game, is actually a button. It turns coins to[CR]bricks and bricks to coins. But it doesnt last long! The trick to using the[CR]Pow Block effectively is to open as many new passages during the time its[CR]active. Is there a wall of bricks somewhere nearby? Snag em as coins and youll[CR]never have to deal with em again![CR] The difference between a small Mario and[CR]a BIG Mario is very important. A small Mario can fit in small passages better[CR]and dodge more easily, whereas a big Mario can smash bricks wide open from[CR]below. Its usually not a good idea to get hit JUST to become small, because[CR]small Mario, of course, can die in one hit.[CR] The difference between Hammer[CR]Mario and Fire Mario is ALSO important. Fire Mario is the most excellent melee[CR]fighter, as his attacks hit ground-based enemies with ease and can even KO the[CR]Koopa Kids without making them mad. Hammer Mario is a heavy fighter; his[CR]hammers KO ANYTHING, and they lob in the air, making them effective against[CR]airborne enemies but NOT against ground enemies. Use the Hammer Suit mostly in[CR]castles or in levels with lots of flying enemies for the best results.[CR] The[CR]Tanooki Suit is actually a very powerful weapon. The stone-mode can either be[CR]used to hide from enemies or projectiles, OR... Try solidifying in midair, and[CR]any enemies you land on can be KOd more easily, as if youre in the Kuribos[CR]Shoe.[CR]And finally... the Magic Whistle. Its hidden SOMEWHERE in the game,[CR]and its accessable from ANY of the first 6 Worlds... But its NOT in any of the[CR]actual levels. There MUST be a way... Can you find[CR]it?[CR]===============================[CR]THE 8[CR]WORLDS[CR]------------[CR]World 1: Murky Courtyard[CR] This World suffered[CR]least from the effects of Chaos Control, being farthest away. The surface of[CR]this land is similar to the moon, as it is grey and dusty, but it is still[CR]full of plants and wildlife. There is also a river running down the middile of[CR]the World, a greenish hue to it, still perfectly safe for swimming...[CR]probably.[CR] Areas: 9[CR] Hammer Bros: 2[CR] Theme: Basic enemies and[CR]obsticles[CR] Koopa Kid: Lemmy[CR]World 2: Desert of 100 Duels[CR] Once a[CR]sunny desert, this land is now a tar-covered barren land, cracked and baking[CR]under the relentless sun. Koopa scavengers roam the endless land, attacking[CR]anyone they meet, hence the name of the World.[CR] Areas: 9[CR] Hammer Bros:[CR]7[CR] Theme: Desert-type levels[CR] Koopa Kid: Morton[CR]World 3: Magictrick[CR]Land[CR] This World specializes in tricking and frusterating anyone inside.[CR]Drawbridges seem to be out of commission at the worst possible times, and[CR]there are tons of exciting moments inside the levels.[CR] Areas: 13[CR] Hammer[CR]Bros: 3[CR] Theme: A tricky Overworld[CR] Koopa Kid: Wendy[CR]World 4: Shadow[CR]Mountain[CR] This World became an azure, mysterious mountain reigon.[CR]Everything on the east side is HUGE, and Sledge Hammer Bros. constantly patrol[CR]their homeland, making passersby feel unwelcome... especially when theres a[CR]standoff.[CR] Areas: 13[CR] Hammer Bros: 4[CR] Theme: Giant-type levels[CR]Koopa Kid: Iggy[CR]World 5: The Twin Midas Valleys[CR] A secret city of gold[CR]with two sides... It is said that the only way from the west side to the east[CR]side is by way of a magical tower.

The tidal level has risen and the land is now[CR]an ocean lined with beautiful glaciers. There is a Koopa Sea-Frigate patroling[CR]the lagoon in the center of the map... They say it guards something, but what[CR]exactly?[CR] Areas: 14[CR] Hammer Bros: 4[CR] Theme: Ice-type levels with[CR]water in them[CR] Koopa Kid: Larry[CR]World 7: The Uncharted Continent[CR]This World is a haven for the daring explorer; plentiful in dense jungle, dry[CR]barens, caverns and coves, all just WAITING to be explored. The land contains[CR]many wild enemies, and though no Hammer Bros. patrol the surface, you may[CR]occasionally battle your way through a Piraniah Plant infestation.[CR] Areas:[CR]15[CR] Hammer Bros: 0[CR] Theme: Its got the WORKS![CR] Koopa Kid:[CR]Ludwig[CR]World 8: Onyx Stronghold[CR] Bowsers improved domain. Chaos Control,[CR]being strongest here, transformed his seemingly evil domain into a downright[CR]demonic twilight world. His castle, Bowser Scantum, is set up here, all the[CR]way in the far back of the World. Dont expect to get there without a fight,[CR]though... First you must fight through caverns, piraniah plants, tanks and a[CR]WHOLE lotta fortresses![CR] Areas: 13[CR] Hammer Bros: 0[CR] Theme: Fortress-[CR]type levels[CR] Koopa Kid: Bowser... whos NOT much of a[CR]kid[CR]===============================[CR]CREDITS[CR]-------[CR]Thanks[CR]to:[CR]-hukka (for creating the SMB3 Workshop, which I made all my levels[CR]with)[CR]-Acmlm (for creating SMB3 Discombobulator, which I created all my[CR]Overworlds with)[CR]-DurfarC (for beta-testing so thuroughly) (I feel sheepish[CR]for misspelling his name in a previous version of this Manual)[CR]-Googie (for[CR]beta-testing as well)[CR]-Nintendo (After all, its THEIR game I hacked!)[CR]I[CR]believe thats it.

Bowser obtained a jewel containing the ultimate power, the[CR]Chaos Control, and Mario has to stop him and save the world once[CR]again.[CR]Read Me:[CR]===============================[CR]Super Mario Bros.[CR]CHAOS CONTROL[CR]===============================[CR]Contents:[CR]-Directions[CR] -Story[CR] -Techniques[CR] -The 8 Worlds[CR]-Credits[CR]===============================[CR]DIRECTIONS[CR]----------[CR] To[CR]get this Rom Hack ready:[CR]-First, make sure you have a normal version of[CR]Super Mario Bros. 3, Rom format, on your hard drive, along with Lunar IPS (an[CR]IPS Patcher) and an emulator. And, of course, you need this IPS file.[CR]-Open[CR]Lunar IPS and patch the file to the Rom.[CR]-Open the Rom in your emulator and[CR]presto, youre ready to play![CR] DO NOT:[CR]-Patch the file to an already[CR]hacked or bad Rom. This will most likely royally screw your poor[CR]Rom.[CR]-Patch to a Rom other than Super Mario Bros. 3. Ditto.[CR]-Hack my[CR]hack. Quite disrespectful! I mean, even if you dont CHANGE anything and just[CR]look around via editor, its still cheating and upsetting to me.[CR]-Sell my[CR]hack. Its FREE, as in Zero-Cash-Necessary free.[CR]I expect you to obey these[CR]requests, as it is, in Schwas words, "The Honorable asset of a fighter". Of[CR]course, youre not a fighter exactly, but Schwas words are still wise. Ah, but[CR]maybe you ARE a fighter...? Ill never know though, will I?[CR];_;[CR]===============================[CR]STORY[CR]-----[CR] "Muhuhahaha! At[CR]last, I have something POWERFUL!" Bowser exclaimed deep within the mines of a[CR]distant land. In his rough hand he held a jewel containing the ultimate[CR]power-- the Chaos Emerald. By the means of a dream Kammy Koopa had one night,[CR]they were able to trace this elusive jewel to its very location underground.[CR]And now that Bowser had near unlimited power at his disposal, he was going to[CR]use it... to crush Mario forever.[CR] Flying back to his homeworld via[CR]Clownmobile (the one he always flies around in), keeping the Emerald safe in a[CR]prism the entire way, Bowser headed back to World 8, Dark Land (or Castle of[CR]Koopa, whichever you prefer) and landed atop his castle. He and Kammy Koopa[CR]stood at the pinnacle, wondering what to do next. Kammy spoke:[CR] "In my[CR]dream, the voice said, This contains the unlimited power of Chaos Control.[CR]Find it. But what would THAT mean?"[CR] Bowser shook his head. "Chaos[CR]Control... Hmm..."[CR] Instantly the green Emerald lit up, emitting a[CR]noticable energy. Bowser laughed. "Okay! I figured it out! Take cover,[CR]Kammy!"[CR] Kammy flew back on her broom about 100 feet or so. Bowser held the[CR]Emerald heavenward and shouted at the top of his lungs, "CHAOS...[CR]CONTROL!!!"[CR] Immensely bright light poured out of the jewel, enveloping[CR]everything as far as the eye could see. And in reality, this light had covered[CR]every square inch of ALL 8 of the Worlds in Mushroom Kingdom! This was Chaos[CR]Control at its strongest.[CR] When the light cleared, World 8 was WAY[CR]different. Instead of a hot, dark, barren-like area, it resembled something[CR]like a twilight universe. Bowser and Kammy were amazed. "Wow! Kammy, lets go[CR]check out the new and improved Mushroom Kingdom!"[CR] They flew across all the[CR]new Worlds, and were amazed further. They were made MUCH harder to travel on[CR]by foot, thats for sure! Bowser had accomplished the feat of transforming[CR]every World through the power of Chaos Control, but he wasnt done.[CR] "Ill[CR]build 7 new Airships and power them with the Emerald. Ill send one Ship out to[CR]the 7 Worlds before mine, piloted by my Koopa Kids. Ill have all the Magic[CR]Wands re-stolen from the 7 Kings, who still dont know what hit them. And this[CR]will lure Mario to his doom! Muhuhahaha!!"[CR] Meanwhile, right after the[CR]light cleared, Princess Peach (who was in Marios house on the outskirts of[CR]World 1) looked out the window... and what she saw was NOT the Grass Land she[CR]was used to, but more like the surface of the moon. (The only difference would[CR]be that it was still daylight over the World they were in, making it look[CR]TRULY weird.) Peach quickly brought Mario to the window, and he was all[CR]"Ooh!"[CR] Peach was worried and didnt know what to do, when news via an[CR]excited Toad reached her informing her that 7 out of 8 Worlds were under[CR]attack by a MASSIVE Battlecruiser.[CR] "Wait a minute... 7 out of 8?" Peach[CR]inquired.[CR] "Thats right! Suspicious, eh? But Ive got to tell the others!"[CR]And the Toad child ran off.[CR] Mario didnt waste any time. "Ooh, no ya dont,[CR]big Bowser! Its-a Marios day!" And ran down the road, en route to the Worlds[CR]Castle. He never noticed that Peach went her own sepearte way after he left[CR]the house...[CR] Can Mario restore the effects of Chaos Control? The only way[CR]to do that would be to win the Emerald back. So good luck, Mario! And Peach,[CR]wherever youve gone off to... Good luck to you,[CR]too.[CR]===============================[CR]TECHNIQUES[CR]----------[CR] The[CR]laws of physics are exactly the same as before in the new Mario 3. Mario can[CR]jump and run, and through those two abilities alone, he can do MANY things.[CR]Most enemies can be beaten by jumping on them, but some cant. The ones that[CR]cant, well... The best way is usually through the Koopa Shell! Stomping a[CR]Koopa makes it hide in its shell, duh, but the shell is a VERY good weapon.[CR]There are two ways to attack via shell:[CR]-Run into the foe and slam it with[CR]the shell, or[CR]-Get close and kick the shell once at eye level.[CR]The pros[CR]and cons to this? The second way is usually more dangerous, as a flying shell[CR]can hurt YOU like anyone else, but it can also hit more than one foe-- in fact[CR]it destroyes any foes it touches. The first way, on the other hand, kills the[CR]shell AND the enemy at the same time. This way the shell wont riccoshe of a[CR]wall and damage you, but it can only be used against one enemy, rather than[CR]many.[CR] The Pow Block, in this game, is actually a button. It turns coins to[CR]bricks and bricks to coins. But it doesnt last long! The trick to using the[CR]Pow Block effectively is to open as many new passages during the time its[CR]active. Is there a wall of bricks somewhere nearby? Snag em as coins and youll[CR]never have to deal with em again![CR] The difference between a small Mario and[CR]a BIG Mario is very important. A small Mario can fit in small passages better[CR]and dodge more easily, whereas a big Mario can smash bricks wide open from[CR]below. Its usually not a good idea to get hit JUST to become small, because[CR]small Mario, of course, can die in one hit.[CR] The difference between Hammer[CR]Mario and Fire Mario is ALSO important. Fire Mario is the most excellent melee[CR]fighter, as his attacks hit ground-based enemies with ease and can even KO the[CR]Koopa Kids without making them mad. Hammer Mario is a heavy fighter; his[CR]hammers KO ANYTHING, and they lob in the air, making them effective against[CR]airborne enemies but NOT against ground enemies. Use the Hammer Suit mostly in[CR]castles or in levels with lots of flying enemies for the best results.[CR] The[CR]Tanooki Suit is actually a very powerful weapon. The stone-mode can either be[CR]used to hide from enemies or projectiles, OR... Try solidifying in midair, and[CR]any enemies you land on can be KOd more easily, as if youre in the Kuribos[CR]Shoe.[CR]And finally... the Magic Whistle. Its hidden SOMEWHERE in the game,[CR]and its accessable from ANY of the first 6 Worlds... But its NOT in any of the[CR]actual levels. There MUST be a way... Can you find[CR]it?[CR]===============================[CR]THE 8[CR]WORLDS[CR]------------[CR]World 1: Murky Courtyard[CR] This World suffered[CR]least from the effects of Chaos Control, being farthest away. The surface of[CR]this land is similar to the moon, as it is grey and dusty, but it is still[CR]full of plants and wildlife. There is also a river running down the middile of[CR]the World, a greenish hue to it, still perfectly safe for swimming...[CR]probably.[CR] Areas: 9[CR] Hammer Bros: 2[CR] Theme: Basic enemies and[CR]obsticles[CR] Koopa Kid: Lemmy[CR]World 2: Desert of 100 Duels[CR] Once a[CR]sunny desert, this land is now a tar-covered barren land, cracked and baking[CR]under the relentless sun. Koopa scavengers roam the endless land, attacking[CR]anyone they meet, hence the name of the World.[CR] Areas: 9[CR] Hammer Bros:[CR]7[CR] Theme: Desert-type levels[CR] Koopa Kid: Morton[CR]World 3: Magictrick[CR]Land[CR] This World specializes in tricking and frusterating anyone inside.[CR]Drawbridges seem to be out of commission at the worst possible times, and[CR]there are tons of exciting moments inside the levels.[CR] Areas: 13[CR] Hammer[CR]Bros: 3[CR] Theme: A tricky Overworld[CR] Koopa Kid: Wendy[CR]World 4: Shadow[CR]Mountain[CR] This World became an azure, mysterious mountain reigon.[CR]Everything on the east side is HUGE, and Sledge Hammer Bros. constantly patrol[CR]their homeland, making passersby feel unwelcome... especially when theres a[CR]standoff.[CR] Areas: 13[CR] Hammer Bros: 4[CR] Theme: Giant-type levels[CR]Koopa Kid: Iggy[CR]World 5: The Twin Midas Valleys[CR] A secret city of gold[CR]with two sides... It is said that the only way from the west side to the east[CR]side is by way of a magical tower. This once prospering city now lies in[CR]ruins, and its so eerie and quiet that time seems to stand still here.[CR]Areas: 14[CR] Hammer Bros: 5[CR] Theme: Switching between two maps[CR] Koopa[CR]Kid: Roy[CR]World 6: Ocean Paradise[CR] Most of the ice in Iced Land has now[CR]melted away due to a bright sun. The tidal level has risen and the land is now[CR]an ocean lined with beautiful glaciers. There is a Koopa Sea-Frigate patroling[CR]the lagoon in the center of the map... They say it guards something, but what[CR]exactly?[CR] Areas: 14[CR] Hammer Bros: 4[CR] Theme: Ice-type levels with[CR]water in them[CR] Koopa Kid: Larry[CR]World 7: The Uncharted Continent[CR]This World is a haven for the daring explorer; plentiful in dense jungle, dry[CR]barens, caverns and coves, all just WAITING to be explored. The land contains[CR]many wild enemies, and though no Hammer Bros. patrol the surface, you may[CR]occasionally battle your way through a Piraniah Plant infestation.[CR] Areas:[CR]15[CR] Hammer Bros: 0[CR] Theme: Its got the WORKS![CR] Koopa Kid:[CR]Ludwig[CR]World 8: Onyx Stronghold[CR] Bowsers improved domain. Chaos Control,[CR]being strongest here, transformed his seemingly evil domain into a downright[CR]demonic twilight world. His castle, Bowser Scantum, is set up here, all the[CR]way in the far back of the World. Dont expect to get there without a fight,[CR]though... First you must fight through caverns, piraniah plants, tanks and a[CR]WHOLE lotta fortresses![CR] Areas: 13[CR] Hammer Bros: 0[CR] Theme: Fortress-[CR]type levels[CR] Koopa Kid: Bowser... whos NOT much of a[CR]kid[CR]===============================[CR]CREDITS[CR]-------[CR]Thanks[CR]to:[CR]-hukka (for creating the SMB3 Workshop, which I made all my levels[CR]with)[CR]-Acmlm (for creating SMB3 Discombobulator, which I created all my[CR]Overworlds with)[CR]-DurfarC (for beta-testing so thuroughly) (I feel sheepish[CR]for misspelling his name in a previous version of this Manual)[CR]-Googie (for[CR]beta-testing as well)[CR]-Nintendo (After all, its THEIR game I hacked!)[CR]I[CR]believe thats it. However, if I left you out, OR you have bug to report,[CR]e-mail me at:[CR]schwawarrior@yahoo.com[CR]And I will get back to you as soon[CR]as I can. Thank you, and enjoy the game! --Schwa</plot>

    <plot>This is a hack of the original SMB2 game with new levels. The idea behind this[CR]hack is that it's the same SMB2 game we all love, but with entirely new[CR]levels.

You go through some and fall off the top of your[CR]destination[CR]screen. Even Maxs_Evil_Brother couldnt help me figure them all[CR]out,[CR]so I edited in many cases to take this into account.[CR]Theres a[CR]strange bug in 5-1. If you take the potion and return to[CR]the location you[CR]started from, sometimes a door will open when in[CR]subspace that remains when[CR]you return to normal. It leads back a few[CR]worlds.[CR]I also spent some time[CR]restoring the 4 players attributes and[CR]abilities after a bug in the editor[CR]mucks them up every time it[CR]saves.

May I suggest grabbing as[CR]many as you find[CR]if you[CR]arent using save states. After 5-1 there are no more free[CR]lives, very few[CR]coins that can be harvested, and some of the levels[CR]dont even offer[CR]mushrooms past this point.[CR]1-3 if you have Luigi, you can reach the top of[CR]the cloud for the[CR]free 1-up[CR]In 3-3 there is a section of wall that you[CR]can go through to avoid a[CR]few baddies.

    <plot>With 8 newly themed worlds to explore, Super Mario Bros 3: A New Journey[CR]sticks with the original SMB3 format while using new graphics, custom over-[CR]world music and new levels to continue Mario and Luigi's adventure beyond the[CR]original 8 worlds. Some tweaked sprites are also present. The difficulty is[CR]meant for semi-experienced players looking for new challenges. If you enjoy[CR]the Super Mario Bros. 3 gameplay experience, give this one a try! V 1.1 Fixes[CR]some minor bugs, level design and graphics issues. Coming soon is V 1.2 with[CR]two separate patches: A patch for experienced players (the current version[CR]V1.1) and a patch with more player friendly level designs so everyone of all[CR]skill levels can play.

I wanted to create an[CR]NES-Style SMB3 game and use the power [CR]of the SMW ROM to create different[CR]sprites and adventures. I created all the original SMB3 graphics into the SMW[CR]ROM and designed 4 [CR]unpolished worlds with levels. Later that year, I[CR]realized this project was a bit over my head, especially with the music, and[CR]decided[CR]to create my ideas using an SMB3 NES ROM. I eventually named this[CR]project Super Mario Raccoon. I created a rough rendering of the first [CR]6[CR]worlds unpolished on April, 2013 and my progress has been at a crawl for a[CR]long time. All 8 worlds were finished in late 2015 and Ive [CR]been doing a[CR]lot of polishing until its release in November. I renamed the project A New[CR]Journey in August,[CR]2016.[CR]------------------------------------[CR]CREDITS[CR]------------------------------------[CR]All[CR]custom graphics, music, sprites, overworld and level designs created by Alan[CR]Jacobs[CR]*except for levels 4-3, 4-8 and 8-Submarine designed by[CR]Mari42.[CR]Custom autoscrolling by Mari42[CR]I wish to thank the following for[CR]the programs they created:[CR]FCEUXD - bbitmaster[CR]SMB3 Map Editor -[CR]Beneficii[CR]Workshop - hukka[CR]Object TSA Editor - DahrkDaiz[CR]YYCHR -[CR]Yy[CR]I wish to thank the[CR]Testers:[CR]Trax[CR]Mari42[CR]Gerry[CR]Levi[CR]Zacmario[CR]I wish to thank the[CR]following people for forum help, suggestions and ROM[CR]information:[CR]Yoshiatom[CR]Googie[CR]Termingamer2-JD[CR]Mari42[CR]Chaobomr[CR]Insectduel[CR]Hamtaro126[CR]Quick[CR]Curly[CR]KP9000[CR]Special thank you to Mari42 for his dedication to this[CR]project in its final days of completion.[CR]Most of all, I wish to thank the[CR]many who posted positive comments and private messages urging me to finish[CR]this project.

    <plot>This is an IPS patch intended to restore the presumed original Spiny Egg[CR]behaviour to this hack, as an optional feature, much the same as the patches[CR]already existing for the NES version of Super Mario Bros. and the FDS version[CR]of Super Mario Bros. 2. This replaces the hex values found in the "Super Mario[CR]Bros. Special for NES" image of... 20 FF C2 A0 02 95 58 C9 00 30 01 88[CR]...with...

    <plot>Many years ago there was a very cool hack called "Mario Fantasy Adventure",[CR]which was apparently originally made by Acmlm. However, while there was some[CR]awesome music and graphic work done on the hack, the hack was unfinished and[CR]the changes only lasted up until the first temple. This hack continues the[CR]Mario Fantasy Adventure and changes the characters, monsters, and other[CR]graphics through the entire game. Every monster and weapon has been modified.[CR]The character classes have also been completed (there were 2 Toads and 2[CR]Peachs). You now pick from: Mario, Luigi, Yoshi, Toad, Peach and Daisy and[CR]they all have corresponding class upgrades as well.</plot>

[CR] - If you die when you fight the[CR]final boss, you keep the same power level of [CR] your weapon.[CR] - you cant[CR]pause the game anymore.[CR] V 1.1[CR] - The score in game has been removed to[CR]avoid the "8 Sprites Per Scanline"[CR] problems on the top of the screen.[CR]V 1.2[CR]- A minor change on Turricans sprite.[CR]- Changed the design of the[CR]gems.[CR] v 1.3[CR] - Vertical scrolling adjusted.[CR] - Falling speed[CR]reduced.[CR] - Final boss take fewer hits to kill.[CR] Apply the IPS file to[CR]"Super Turrican (E).nes" and have fun!!![CR] note 1: sorry for my english, but[CR]english is not my native language.

    <plot>This is the debut release of The Legend of Iowa, a complete rewrite of "The[CR]Legend of Zelda". Since the nature of this game is one of secrets and[CR]exploration, there are bound to be instances where you just don't know what to[CR]do or where to go next. Again, feel free to contact me with questions. This[CR]game was designed with the original Zelda in mind, so fans of that game should[CR]know what to expect. Difficulty was toned down (particularly that of the early[CR]Second Quest) pursuant to the feedback of several Beta Testers; this hack is[CR]on-par with or slightly easier than the original game. This hack is intended[CR]to capture the original sense of immersion found in the early Zelda games.[CR]Fans of the original will know once they get involved in the game: epic[CR]exploration, multiple routes, cryptic hints and scores of secrets. Despite[CR]playing like a Zelda game, it establishes its own identity. To wit: * The[CR]entire Soundtrack has been replaced. And in most cases, with 8-bit renditions[CR]of vintage techno/dance/rave classics! * The Overworld is completely new.[CR]Graphics, layouts, animation, screen-specific Attribute Patterns and etc! * 18[CR]New Dungeons. Or more accurately: 18 Meth Labs, nine per quest. Don't expect[CR]the same old tricks to work, either. The secret pushblock isn't always going[CR]to be leftmost-center. (Possibly never!) * New Dungeon Elements. In addition[CR]to the new graphics, layouts, animations and Attribute Patterns, you'll be[CR]dealing with new room secrets and enemy combinations. The doors are open, but[CR]you still need to find that pushblock to make a critical item appear! But[CR]first, you'll need to kill that small army of Darknuts and Wizzrobes... * Work[CR]for Life. The number of complete heart containers has been reduced from 13 to[CR]1. If you want to expand your lifebar, you'll have to seek out the 48 heart[CR]pieces! * WAY More Bombs! They aren't exactly bombs in this hack, but they[CR]explode just the same. And if you play your cards right, you'll max-out your[CR]carrying capacity at 255! * Stopwatch as an Item. Again, it isn't exactly a[CR]Stopwatch (nor is it easy to acquire), but you'll eventually have a form of[CR]portable invincibility to use against That One Boss(tm). * New storyline,[CR]characters and enemy designs. Farmer Bob even grunts differently! Also, total[CR]accolades to everyone in the wider ROM hacking community, who patiently[CR]endured a seemingly endless series of delays with respect to this hack. (The[CR]original release was supposed to be Xmas Eve, 2009!) Enough waiting! Let's go[CR]tangle with some meth-heads!!! * *WARNING** ADULT THEMES ARE PRESENT IN THIS[CR]AND MAY NOT BE SUITABLE FOR SOME AUDIENCES * *DANGER** THOSE WHO ARE PRONE TO[CR]SEIZURES MAY WISH TO KNOW THAT SOME PARTS OF THE GAME HAVE CONTINUOUS FLASHING[CR]WHICH MAY INDUCE SEIZURES OR UNDESIRED EFFECTS ON PEOPLE WHO ARE SENSITIVE TO[CR]THESE TYPES OF DISPLAY!! At the request of Dr.Floppy, he wishes the patch to[CR]be hosted on Baddesthacks.net until further notice.[CR]Read Me:[CR]The[CR]LEGEND of IOWA[CR]Version 1.00[CR]This is the debut release of The Legend of[CR]Iowa, a complete rewrite of "The Legend of Zelda".

    <plot>This hack updates the entire The Legend of Zelda game to match the look of[CR]more (relatively) modern Zelda games, particularly the Oracle series. With the[CR]exception of a few background tiles in dungeons, every tile has been updated[CR]including enemies, items and bosses. However, nothing has been moved or had[CR]its behavior changed, and all of the graphic changes are simply updates (as[CR]opposed to replacements). A few text changes have been made to the title to[CR]make the items match most Zelda continuity (for example: Red Ring is now Red[CR]Tunic, Magical Sword is now Master Sword, etc.) No in-game text has been[CR]changed. Many the dungeons have been re-colored so that each has its own color[CR]scheme (rather than have 2 gold dungeons, 2 grey ones, etc.). For example:[CR]Level 8 (The Forest Dungeon) is now green while Level 5 (The Mountain Dungeon)[CR]is brown. Level 2 (The Moon Dungeon) is purple(?). The Automap Plus from[CR]snarfblam has been thrown in. This is the only functional change (improvement)[CR]to the game.</plot>

    <plot>This hack came about out of frustration with the hack it's based on, Zelda[CR]Challenge Outlands for Legend Of Zelda on the NES. This description is going[CR]to be rather terse as to not spoil anything but it is enough to say that no[CR]changes have been made to the dungeons, only the overworld, which has been[CR]considered by many to be needlessly restricting and over-complicated. Thus the[CR]overworld is easier to navigate and some items easier to acquire[but at a high[CR]price]. However, the number and strength of enemies have been increased to[CR]balance things out a bit and maintain a greater challenge than the original[CR]game. This release is considered final. Should any bugs or flaws be[CR]discovered, which should be few if any[as this has been played through several[CR]times already] please send a PM and the problem will addressed ASAP. The patch[CR]is in IPS format and LunarIPS is recommended. The ROM information is the same[CR]as the original patch, as is the readme. For more information on the original[CR]hack this is based on please follow the link below.[CR]http://www.romhacking.net/hacks/10/ It is hoped that you all enjoy it and your[CR]feedback is welcome in the forums or in a review below. Update 1.11; It seems[CR]that the patch originally submitted was based on an early version of the[CR]project. The correct version has now been uploaded. Apologies to all for the[CR]mixed up. Update 1.12; After a report of missing boomerangs and a few glitches[CR]a new patch has been made to correct the problems. Thanks to Roy B. for the[CR]report. Much appreciated buddy! Update 1.13; More bug fixes and removal of a[CR]glitched cave in the first quest. Thanks to Ted R. for the report! Update[CR]1.14; An omission of a candle was discovered. Seems I overlooked including a[CR]candle in the shops. The Red Candle can now be purchased. Thanks to[CR]Jur1sd1ct1on for the heads up!</plot>

    <plot>A completely new Zelda II adventure! Long ago, a curse was cast upon the land[CR]of Hyrule. This darkness gave rise to the minions of Ganon, allowing them to[CR]overrun Forests, Towns, and Meadows. Deep within the forest lives our young[CR]hero, Link. Guide Link across the vast Kingdom of Hyrule, and defeat the[CR]ominous shadow! What's New? * World Maps! * Dungeons! * GFX! * Music! * New[CR]Spell! * Experience Curve! * More areas to explore! * More treasure! * More[CR]Zelda! Easy Version: * Enemies deal 1x damage. * Start with 6 lives. * Link's[CR]sword is stronger. * Life spell costs 50% less magic at all levels. *[CR]Beginning town has a magic refill lady. Hard Version: * Enemies deal 2x[CR]damage. * Start with 4 lives. * Link's sword is weaker. * Life spell costs 50%[CR]less magic at level 8. While the majority of the hack was done by me, there[CR]are new surprises to find thanks to the efforts of others. Trax helped out a[CR]lot with programming and created a new spell! He also helped with improving[CR]enemies to make them more fierce! Beware of the bots. :P Enjoy the new[CR]Overworld Music thanks to optomon. He composed it perfectly and it really[CR]enhances the Zelda feel! To everyone that helped, THANK YOU! Trax, JaSp,[CR]HylianFox, ocw, Dwedit, Ice Ranger, Jigglysaint, Googie, optomon.

    <plot>I had been playing Wario Blast one day, and had thought that it would've been[CR]nice to see more Wario/Bomberman crossovers, so I made this hack. This hack[CR]features assets mainly from games that Wario has appeared in (mainly Wario[CR]Land), along with some custom-made ones. It also features an edited map, some[CR]new music, and a few other things. That just about covers it. Feel free to[CR]check the readme file if you need more information.[CR]Read[CR]Me:[CR]==================[CR] How To Use[CR]==================[CR]This IPS[CR]patch is meant to be applied to the Bomberman (USA) rom file.[CR] [CR]In order[CR]to use this patch, youll need Lunar IPS and a rom of Bomberman (USA). Google[CR]is your friend here. Once you obtain both of the aforementioned, you[CR]should[CR]be able to open the patch file, and choose a ROM to apply it to.[CR]Make sure that you apply it to an unmodified ROM, or else there will be[CR]issues. Once youve[CR]done that, you should be able to play the hack in an[CR]emulator of your choice. Id personally recommened FCEUX, but most emulators[CR]should get the job done.[CR]Id recommend avoiding Nestopia though, as it seems[CR]to have issues with palettes.[CR]==================[CR]Credits[CR]==================[CR]All of the people who have made FCEUX what it[CR]is today. This wouldnt have been possible without their work.[CR]Snowbro for[CR]his Tile Editting utility.[CR]My friend, Brandon, for doing some last minute[CR]testing of the hack for me. I appreciate it.[CR]Nintendo and Hudson for the[CR]Wario and Bomberman franchises. (Youll be missed,[CR]Hudson.)[CR]==================[CR] Contact[CR]==================[CR]If you[CR]have any questions or comments, feel free to PM me at the site, or contact me[CR]via my YouTube channel.

    <plot>I left this hack in the back burner in 2005 when I first released a demo. I[CR]was poking at it back and forth in 2006 but didn't have the motivation to work[CR]and the hack and almost killed it. Wario and Waluigi are the stars of this[CR]hack, Mario and Luigi are no where to be found, so the news that Peach got[CR]kidnapped by Bowser and his son reach Wario and Waluigi's ears. They figure[CR]that if they can save Peach, they'll be favored more than their arch rivals.[CR]So yeah, the hack is short but the challenges will make up for it.

    <plot>This is probably the best Zelda hack out there. Almost every single thing[CR]possible to modify in the game has been modified. This hack exemplifies the[CR]talented individuals in our community. Anybody even remotely interested in[CR]ROMhacking should give this one a try! The old world map has been completely[CR]overwritten by the new one. You are guaranteed not to recognize any locations[CR]from the previous game. All location of dungeons and secrets have been changed[CR]as well. Secrets are now locked according to what quest you're playing. For[CR]example, the rock you push to find a dungeon won't move on the second quest,[CR]so you have to find a new entrance somewhere else in the world. The game[CR]allows each secret to be set to 1st Quest, 2nd Quest, both, or neither. So,[CR]many places where you can bomb, burn, push things and use the recorder are[CR]quest-specific. Most of the monsters have new graphics (including all bosses)[CR]and some even have new colors. There are 42 possible block, water and statue[CR]arrangements for the many dungeon rooms, and all but 3 are brand new. That's[CR]just a taste of what has been changed and how much work went into this[CR]hack![CR]Read Me:[CR]Zelda Challenge: Outlands -- Bug-fix Info[CR]1.)[CR]Switching from the old to the new:[CR]You dont have to lose any progress in[CR]the game. Simply follow these directions:[CR]- Apply the patch to a copy of[CR]your original Zelda rom, NOT to the old ZeldaC rom.[CR]- Overwrite the old[CR]ZeldaC with the updated version.[CR]- If your game progress can be accessed[CR]simply by selecting your file in the game, go for it![CR]- If your game[CR]progress is via a save-state (F5 in NESticle), simply load the save-state,[CR]save your game the normal way, and continue from there. (Your save-state[CR]file(s) still contain the old data.)[CR]2.) Changes made to Zelda[CR]Challenge:[CR]When ZeldaC was released, it was announced as the "first and[CR]final" version. But I shouldve expected something to go wrong. :) Fortunately,[CR]the only "fatal" bug was the ice-cave lock up. After a long wait to see if[CR]anything else turned up, Ive made the following changes to the game:[CR]- The[CR]secret ice cave (potion shop) no longer locks up when you try to exit. My[CR]sincere apologies to those of you who were caught off guard by this. It was[CR]all the fault of a single tektite-turned-vire.[CR]- Ive removed the extra note[CR]from the first quest, found in Ganons Mountains (the red area). Its existence[CR]is only supposed to be for discovery in the second quest.[CR]- Ive removed the[CR]extra heart container from the Fortune Heights dungeon of quest 2. This way,[CR]there arent any extra containers in the quest.[CR]- Ive removed the 2nd and[CR]3rd Thunderbirds from the last level of the 2nd quest, because they were often[CR]rendered optional fights. Guess theres only supposed to be one final boss...[CR]:)[CR]- Ive removed a few of the monsters from the screen east of the dock, to[CR]prevent slowdown.[CR]- I removed the extra map from the first dungeon of the[CR]2nd quest.[CR]- I removed the accidental shortcut in Level 9 that lets you get[CR]by without the Stalfos Key.[CR]- So many things I removed! Heres something I[CR]put in: a secret potion shop near Level 9.</plot>

The hero of[CR]legend, had many different forms. He saved many kingdoms, restoring peace in[CR]all the lands. This is but one of the legends, of which the people speak...[CR]Here is a ROM hack for the Legend of Zelda which has had many hours put into[CR]it (just shy of 3 years), ASM and coding changes, and graphics overhauls. New[CR]items have replaced the old ones in the original game and new concepts have[CR]been used in the game such as pitfalls, dash boots, the use of the hammer, and[CR]many more changes have been added to give the game a much new feel to it. Also[CR]the inclusion of the Capcom sound engine is another welcome change that has[CR]been added to the game. For more details on the patch and how the project[CR]progressed over time please visit this site to take a look at how it started[CR]and how it came to its closing end.  Please use the PRG0 version of the ROM[CR]otherwise the ROM will not work properly. Enjoy! !!!!WARNING!!!! - FOR THOSE[CR]UPDATING, YOU MUST DELETE ANY PREVIOUSLY CREATED IN-GAME SAVES FROM WHICH EVER[CR]EMULATOR.

This is because the emulator you are using, is not utilizing[CR]the MMC5 register $5130 correctly. The romhack perform chr swaps for 3[CR]specific things, the intro, a mini game, and the Ganon fight.

THIS NEW UPDATE[CR]NEEDS TO START FRESH, SINCE THE SRAM HAS BEEN ALTERED. YOU WILL GET A GREY[CR]SCREEN UPON BOOTUP IF YOU DONT.[CR]I honestly never thought id go back to this[CR]game, once it was released. But there was a significant issue that had me[CR]upset a lot, and it was the slowdown issue with the sound engine. That sole[CR]reason, was why I went back with the limited time I had, and tried to decipher[CR]how to either fix completely, or make it considerably better. Then I started[CR]implementing things that I personally wished I did before, but didnt have the[CR]time, nor the rom space. So ill list the following as to what I did.[CR]1:[CR]Slowdown of Sound Engine Cut Down ALOT[CR]Back when this was released in 2014,[CR]I was talking with members at NESDEV, on how to solve the slowdown issue with[CR]my sound engine. The majority of responses, was that I shouldve had my sound[CR]engine as one of the last routines to be loaded within the end of the NMI. So[CR]I rearranged my asm, and placed that sound engine at the end. But every time I[CR]would get significant crashes, and I couldnt figure out a solution, so I left[CR]it as it was.[CR]Fast forward almost two years, I was going to literally step[CR]into every bit of code within the sound engine, to figure why it was crashing[CR]at the end of the NMI. While I was stepping, an interrupt would occur and then[CR]finish and then go back into the sound engine. I kept getting frustrated[CR]saying, why wont you stop interrupting! Im trying to rea...... wait a[CR]minute...... So it was then, that I located an unused register, and I[CR]performed the following. When the sound engine is about to be initiated, I set[CR]the free register to not equal (01) Now heres the part of success, After the[CR]beginning of my NMI when the A,X,Y are pushed to the stack, I do a check of[CR]the register that was set at the beginning of the sound engine, if its not[CR]equal, I jump to the pull stack at the very end of the NMI. I couldnt believe[CR]it when I restarted the game, it didnt crash, and there was no slowdown at[CR]Links house with the octorocks, and links sprite shield![CR]Thats not to say[CR]that it is totally fixed, there is still slowdown here and there, but it is[CR]NOTHING like my last version. I also placed Links sprite shield asm at the end[CR]of the NMI, because that uses a lot of cpu since I do lots of checks and[CR]repositionings of it. I went to various places that I know horrific slowdown[CR]takes place, and it was either normal, or a slight slowdown! This is something[CR]that stopped me from enjoying my own work, and has been the subject of[CR]displeasure ive read throughout the internet. So Im very happy with just this[CR]one fix, which is why I feel this worthy of a re-release. But then after that,[CR]I wanted to add things for me personally.[CR]END[CR]2: 3 Save Game File[CR]System[CR]I destroyed the original $6000-$7FFF sram when designing my game,[CR]because I tried using more space for things, the sound engine ram registers[CR]are located within there. The original Zelda HEAVILY uses the sram for PRG,[CR]because 3 quarters of the HW bank are occupied with DPCM data. When I[CR]converted my rom to MMC5, I wasnt that fully experienced with register $5113,[CR]which allows you to swap out 4 pages (2000 bytes each) of sram. It wasnt until[CR]my Super Mario All-Stars NES project, that I fully understood how to take[CR]advantage of that.[CR]So just a few days ago, I went back to see if I could[CR]pull it off within Legend of Link. Ill spare getting into details, but I was[CR]able to make it so just before the registration screen kicks on, I simply copy[CR]a byte at a time from the 1st sram page, then ill swap the page, and paste[CR]that byte into the new sram page, and I do that for the rest of the pages. And[CR]I added a safety check, so that my routine doesnt overwrite saved data once[CR]its created. Then it was just a cosmetic issue for me to come up with, in[CR]order to use the File system on the registration screen. So glad I got that[CR]working! It always upset me when players would defeat the game, and were faced[CR]with having to delete all that they did to start over fresh. Im sorry it took[CR]almost two years, but this has finally been resolved.[CR]END[CR]3: Inventory[CR]Items In The 3 Boxes and Current B Button Item Now Saved and Restored[CR]This[CR]one was just for kicks. I couldve cared less about having this. But I[CR]discovered I had just a slither of free sram that I could utilize for this[CR]idea. It was an incredibly easy thing to perform, so Im glad I added it[CR]in.[CR]4: When you defeat the game, the file that you used will now have a[CR]flashing star.[CR]END[CR]So thats everything. I will no longer be updating or[CR]adding anything new to this. The only time is if there is a significant game[CR]crashing issue. I have no time to debug or test this out. I have tested on all[CR]3 major PC emualtors. FCEUX, Nestopia, Nintendulator. The game boots, plays,[CR]saves, loads, etc. The only thing Im waiting on, is to test this on my actual[CR]front loader Nintendo. I hope you all enjoy the upgrades and fixes. Idk when[CR]ill be back, but I really wanted to get this out to everyone, I just hope its[CR]not buggy as hell with this 3 file save system.[CR]-infidelity[CR]p.s. Im[CR]pretty amazed no one has discovered my hidden features in almost two years,[CR]heh heh heh. :-D[CR]Id first like to thank everyone at Acmlm Board 2, who took[CR]the time out of their personal scheduals, to play my beta(s) / final versions,[CR]and report all the glitches/errors that were within them. I thank you![CR]Rom[CR]Specs[CR]--------------[CR]Converted from MMC1 to MMC3[CR]PRG and CHR-ROM[CR]expanded to 1024kb/1mb each.[CR]8kb SRAM[CR]Inserted custom MMC5 irq[CR]usage[CR]Inserted modified Capcom 6C80 Sound Engine w/ DPCM sample[CR]usage[CR]PATCH USAGE[CR]----------------------[CR]This patch can only be used[CR]on a "PRG 0" rom version of, "The Legend of Zelda"[CR]NOTES ON[CR]SRAM[CR]---------------------[CR]If you happen to not save, and randomly[CR]reset/shut down the rom, you will most likely experience undesired results[CR]such as, lost data, incomplete data, etc. In order to not experience any[CR]undesired results, ALWAYS save your progress before shutting the game down.[CR]There are now 3 methods to saving (as of v2.1) 1: The save mode within the[CR]inventory menu via the B button. 2: The hidden 2 player Up+A save function[CR](use Up+A on player 2 controller in the inventory menu) 3: Dying.[CR]NOTES ON[CR]PEGASUS BOOTS IN COMBINATION WITH ROCS[CR]FEATHER[CR]------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]In[CR]order to use the Pegasus Boots with Rocs Feather, you obviously need to have[CR]both items in your inventory. So when you are inside the inventory menu, move[CR]the blinking cursor over Rocs Feather, and within the A button box at the[CR]bottom of there screen, will display your current sword. Press up/down to[CR]cycle out the sword for the Pegasus Boots within the A button box. Exit back[CR]to in-game play, and you can use the boots in combination with the feather.[CR]But be warned. Once you do this, your sword is obviously disabled, so you wont[CR]be able to use your sword until you swap the feather out for the[CR]sword.[CR]NOTES ON INVENTORY BLINKING CURSOR and EXITING[CR]PROPERLY[CR]------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]You[CR]will not be able to exit back from the inventory, if you have the blinking[CR]cursor over a blank space. (no item) The only time you are able to exit out of[CR]the inventory over a blank space, is when you are in the inventory before you[CR]obtain The Boomerang, and the cursor needs to be placed where The Boomerangs[CR]location is, which is the upper left of the inventory box.</plot>

However, I have noticed that in LoopyNES, some of the[CR]enemies[CR]tend to fly out of the boundaries of the screen, sometimes causing[CR]the [CR]emulaton to hang.

Evil[CR]doesnt ever really die, it merely bides her time,[CR]waiting to strike[CR]again.[CR] Back in the days past, the Earth had two[CR]moons. One of them[CR]was a desolate wasteland, while the other was alive with[CR]inhabitants.[CR]The moon was full of humans and animals, that coexisted in[CR]harmony. [CR]Everyone lived in peace. Perhaps the most peaceful of the moons[CR]populace[CR]was Princess Selenety. Selenety was one who studied history, and[CR]knew[CR]a vast number of things. [CR] Selenety loved reading about myths and[CR]legends. One legend in [CR]particular, told of a time when the great peace on[CR]Earth would end, and [CR]evil would hand the world over to chaos. One of[CR]Earths moons would be[CR]destroied at this time. But also in this time, a[CR]great warrior would fall[CR]from the sky, and avenge those who died from Evils[CR]wrath. This tale worried[CR]the princess.[CR] Soon to become heir to the[CR]throne, Selenety became anxious, and [CR]raised up a warrior by the name of[CR]Sabes. Selenety guarded Sabes with nine[CR]symbols of power. Enclosed in these[CR]triangle shaped stones, were the keys[CR]to a great power unknown to mortals.[CR] Sabes scattered eight of these keys of power throughout her [CR]homeland,[CR]the land of Eshraz. Sabes chose to guard the ninth fragment [CR]herself. [CR]Being scattreed, the powerkeys could do little more [CR]than emit a faint[CR]light. But both Sabes and Selenety knew that when the [CR]nine symbols[CR]gathered together, the power inside would be released. It was[CR]Sabes[CR]intention to have this power be used to destroy the evil when it [CR]returned[CR]again, and she was determined to have her way.[CR] For a few years, nothing[CR]unusual happened. Sabes became renown as [CR]a great warrior in the land of[CR]Eshraz. Her skill was unmatched. But on [CR]the day that Selenety would become[CR]queen of the moon, a black force [CR]engulfed the Earth and started seeking[CR]out the nine keys of power. Sabes [CR]fought valiantly, but was unable to[CR]recover the eight hidden powerkeys in [CR]time, and was taked captive. Evils[CR]forces eventually found the eight [CR]hiding places of the remaining[CR]powerkeys, but could not enter into the[CR]chambers that held the keys of[CR]power, repelled by Sabes magic.[CR] In a rage, Evil sent a darkness to cover[CR]the moon, to find and [CR]seek out the queen called Selenety. Selenety called[CR]up her armies to [CR]fight back against the darkness, and a war broke out,[CR]plunging the moon [CR]into chaos. Tremors soon erupted all over the moon as[CR]the fighting [CR]threatened to tear the moon apart. Queen Selenety was taken[CR]captiave, [CR]and was faced with a choice. She could either enter the chambers[CR]to [CR]gain the eight fragments of power and assemble them, or Evil would kill[CR]her. Selenety chose to die, with her secrets dieing with her.[CR]However,[CR]using her last breath, she created a warrior that would avenge the[CR]fall [CR]of the moon into Evils control. She called her creation by the name[CR]of [CR]Rahshu.[CR] Selenety witnessed as Evil smashed the moon to peices,[CR]and as her creation sped to the Earth. Her last hope was[CR]that this[CR]wrongdoing would be[CR]avenged...[CR]------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]4.0[CR]WALKTHROUGH[CR] The game opens with Rahshu standing in a mountianous area,[CR]facing [CR]north. He has nothing to his name, and outside of this screen,[CR]Rahshus going [CR]to have to defend himself. Like in the Legend of Zelda,[CR]there are two quests.[CR]Both quests are possible to complete, keep in mind,[CR]as both quests have been [CR]checked for errors. Anyway, this walkthrough will[CR]deal with how to get the [CR]sword in the first quest.[CR] In the original[CR]game, this task was simple; walk into a cave and [CR]listen to an old man tell[CR]you about the rest of the outside world. In this[CR]game, that task is a[CR]little more complicated. To get a sword the player has [CR]two options: search[CR]for two hear containers, or beat two labyrynths. The[CR]end result is the[CR]same, the player must obtain two more heart containers[CR]before even thinking[CR]of doing anything else (unless youre really good).[CR] The first mode of[CR]action would be to gain some form of cash to [CR]obtain some supplies from the[CR]locals. Directly to the north is an open [CR]cave with someone only too happy[CR]to oblidge in giving you some badly-needed[CR]money. Working your way to the[CR]top-right corner of the map, youll encounter[CR]one who will give you 100[CR]rupiees. Between the two, one could afford a candle[CR](used only to burn[CR]enemies and kill off the weaker enemies, like the red [CR]octorocks) and some[CR]bombs as well. From here, the task of gaining the two [CR]heart containers[CR]should be easy. At some time, you might want to talk with [CR]one of the two[CR]little girls that will tell you information for a price. She[CR]gives a clue[CR]to finding one of the heart containers you need.[CR] One heart container is in[CR]a mound of rock directly[CR]north of level 2 (the second labyrynth) in exactly[CR]the same place as in the[CR]first game. The second one is harder to find.[CR]Rahshu should follow the [CR]seaside (youll hear a static-like noise in most[CR]emulators) all the way down [CR]to the bottom-righthand corner of the map.[CR]From here, follow the seaside all [CR]the way until it dead-ends and a ladder[CR]is visable, allowing Rahshu to go [CR]northward. In this screen, the second[CR]heart container can be found. If [CR]youve talked to the little girl, then[CR]youll know where to place the bomb.[CR]Please note that bombs destroy some[CR]walls, rocks, and enemies, and will not [CR]hurt anything else.[CR] The second[CR]quest requires you to obtain the ocarina without a sword.[CR]Use the ocarina[CR]in the desert and in the mountians, and you should obtain [CR]both of the[CR]heart containers you need. Please note that its advised to [CR]complete the[CR]first level before attempting to get the ocarina.[CR]Please visit[CR]"http://www.zhq.com/games/classic/zelda1/z1noswor.htm" for another[CR]take on[CR]playing the game without a sword.

This time I tried to go all out, and I think[CR]it[CR]worked. There have been countless hours put into this hack, trying to[CR]make[CR]it something special, and I hope you see it when you play. ^_^[CR]-New[CR]Graphics..Everything has been changed in some way. There are lots of[CR]custom GFX, but Ive also left in old ones, too. So you will[CR] see new and[CR]old stuff throughout.[CR]-Magic.........You dont need to Pause the Menu[CR]anymore to cast magic! Well,[CR] you still have to push it to select which[CR]magic, but if you have[CR] the Life spell out, just push select until you are[CR]healed! No[CR] more hassle of: Pause, heal, pause, heal, pause,[CR]heal....etc.[CR]-Dungeons......New Dungeon layouts! Mmm, delicious.[CR]-New[CR]Beam......The reason I changed the Sword Beam is because the original one[CR]just....sucked. Hehe. This time, having full health will feel[CR] so[CR]rewarding! ;)[CR]-Enemy Count...In the pause menu is a new feature. If you[CR]look at the bottom[CR] left of the menu, you will see two enemy Icons. The[CR]smaller one[CR] represents Weak enemies, and the bigger one represents[CR]strong[CR] enemies. Once you kill 10 of either one, you will get a prize![CR]Weak enemies usually drop weak potions or small Rupees and the[CR] strong[CR]enemies drop strong potions or big rupees.

Link has reduced[CR]attack power, enemies have[CR]slighty more HP, enemy AI has been tweaked to add[CR]more challenge, and now,[CR]they all have increased attack power.

Hard Version[CR]only![CR]October 10, 2008 - Version 1.4[CR]~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~[CR]-Difficulty has[CR]been tweaked even more.[CR]-Greatly reduced magic consumption of more powerful[CR]spells in the easy version.[CR]-Revised a few hints, making them useful.

[CR]Have[CR]fun!!![CR]--------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]-Updates-[CR]--------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]1.1[CR]I created an easy version of my hack. Thats all.[CR]1.2 I fixed the door you[CR]enter, to get the downstab, in the easy version.[CR] You can now enter[CR]it.[CR]1.3 A major bug that didnt allow you to enter Death Mountain, after[CR]beating the 1st palace, was fixed. (In both Versions)[CR] [CR] Easy version[CR]has been made slightly easier. Mostly palaces though.[CR]1.4 This is a big[CR]update. In both versions, some parts that were[CR] almost impossible to pass,[CR]are fixed and not so rediculous. :)[CR] Basically, both versions were made[CR]easier.[CR]1.5 I fixed quite a bit. I found another major bug in Death[CR]Mountain.[CR] In order to fix the bug, I had to switch the hammer and[CR]glove.[CR] I also fixed some puzzles in the last palace(s).[CR]1.6 This one is[CR]a difficulty update. I found a few more spots that made[CR] made the game[CR]almost impossible. [CR] Oh wait! There was a major bug found in palace 5. I[CR]fixed that in[CR] both versions.[CR]1.7 This is it! I went through the whole[CR]game looking for bugs or things[CR] that could be made better. [CR] I have[CR]checked the game inside and out. :) [CR] This time I fixed a few more puzzles[CR]to make them easier.(Mostly in[CR] the Great Palace.)[CR] I also changed some[CR]text so it would go along with the game.[CR] There were A LOT of minor[CR]imrovements in this update.[CR]1.8 There is a new Easy version. The old Easy[CR]version is now Medium.[CR]1.9 I didnt think there would be another update! Oh[CR]well. There is a[CR] major bug in Palace 1 that would allow you to get stuck[CR]inside a[CR] wall. And because the room that causes this bug is also used[CR]in[CR] Palace 3 and 5, it is a pretty serious bug![CR] I fixed them though, in[CR]all[CR]versions![CR]--------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]--------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]==========================================================================[CR]==========================================================================[CR]NOTE:I[CR]decided to make three versions of my hack: Easy, Medium, and Hard.

I thank you all for playing my version of Zelda II [CR]and I[CR]hope you enjoy what I have created...if it be easy or hard. [CR]Have[CR]fun!!![CR]--------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]-Updates-[CR]--------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]1.1[CR]I created an easy version of my hack. Thats all.[CR]1.2 I fixed the door you[CR]enter, to get the downstab, in the easy version.[CR] You can now enter[CR]it.[CR]1.3 A major bug that didnt allow you to enter Death Mountain, after[CR]beating the 1st palace, was fixed. (In both Versions)[CR] [CR] Easy version[CR]has been made slightly easier. Mostly palaces though.[CR]1.4 This is a big[CR]update. In both versions, some parts that were[CR] almost impossible to pass,[CR]are fixed and not so rediculous. :)[CR] Basically, both versions were made[CR]easier.[CR]1.5 I fixed quite a bit. I found another major bug in Death[CR]Mountain.[CR] In order to fix the bug, I had to switch the hammer and[CR]glove.[CR] I also fixed some puzzles in the last palace(s).[CR]1.6 This one is[CR]a difficulty update. I found a few more spots that made[CR] made the game[CR]almost impossible. [CR] Oh wait! There was a major bug found in palace 5. I[CR]fixed that in[CR] both versions.[CR]1.7 This is it! I went through the whole[CR]game looking for bugs or things[CR] that could be made better. [CR] I have[CR]checked the game inside and out. :) [CR] This time I fixed a few more puzzles[CR]to make them easier.(Mostly in[CR] the Great Palace.)[CR] I also changed some[CR]text so it would go along with the game.[CR] There were A LOT of minor[CR]imrovements in this update.[CR]1.8 There is a new Easy version. The old Easy[CR]version is now Medium.[CR]1.9 I didnt think there would be another update! Oh[CR]well. There is a[CR] major bug in Palace 1 that would allow you to get stuck[CR]inside a[CR] wall. And because the room that causes this bug is also used[CR]in[CR] Palace 3 and 5, it is a pretty serious bug![CR] I fixed them though, in[CR]all[CR]versions![CR]--------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]--------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]==========================================================================[CR]==========================================================================[CR]NOTE:I[CR]decided to make three versions of my hack: Easy, Medium, and Hard. [CR]I did[CR]this so that more people would be able to enjoy my hack. They all [CR]play the[CR]same except for a few[CR]differences.[CR]==========================================================================[CR]==========================================================================[CR]--------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]-About the Easy[CR]Version-[CR]--------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]The[CR]title screen has the same old sword from the original game. :([CR]Your sword[CR]is very strong![CR]Enemies have a lot more HP. (And because your sword is[CR]strong in this[CR]version, they will be too easy to kill.)[CR]Some magic costs[CR]less MP.[CR]The cave south of Zeldas Castle is now accessible at the beginning[CR]of[CR]the game. Go check it out![CR]The Up and Down stabs are in this[CR]version.[CR]"HIKING-the destination can be reached rather comfortably." -RE[CR]Quote[CR]--------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]-About the Medium[CR]Version-[CR]--------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Its[CR]in[CR]between?[CR]--------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]-About the Hard[CR]Version-[CR]--------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]The[CR]title screen has an all-new sword. :)[CR]Your sword is very weak![CR]Enemies[CR]have a lot more HP. (And because your sword is weaker in this[CR]version, they[CR]will be harder to kill.)[CR]Some magic costs more MP.[CR]I added a fun secret[CR]to ONLY this version but Im not going to say what! [CR]You will like it[CR]though, once you see it. Alright, Ill tell you...[CR]There is a suprise near[CR]the end of the game. But only if you get there [CR]with your magic stat at[CR]level 1...[CR]The Up and Down stabs are NOT in this version.[CR]"MOUNTAIN[CR]CLIMBING-beyond the hardships lies accomplishment." -RE[CR]Quote[CR]--------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]-Contact[CR]Info-[CR]--------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]If[CR]you have any questions or comments about my hack, please email me at:[CR]the_icepenguin@yahoo.com[CR]--------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]-Credits-[CR]--------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]The[CR]only person who deserves to be in this section is Dwedit.

    <plot>This is my second Zelda II hack, and just like the first, it is a whole new[CR]adventure! Enjoy![CR]Read Me:[CR]Version 1.0 March 4, 2007(Release[CR]Date)[CR]Version 1.9 March 15, 2007(Last[CR]Update)[CR]--------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]--------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Zelda II - The Adventure of Link "Part 3" by Ice Penguin[CR]--------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]--------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Table[CR]of contents:[CR]-About the Hack-[CR]-Updates-[CR]-Contact[CR]Info-[CR]-Credits-[CR]--------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]--------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]-About the[CR]Hack-[CR]--------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Hi[CR]everyone. This is my second Zelda II hack!:) This time around, things[CR]wont[CR]be so difficult. Unlike "Part 2", I made the levels a lot easier[CR]to[CR]explore, but just so you know, I would never make it TOO easy.;)[CR]As[CR]for enemy placement, I pretty much left that the same. There will be a[CR]couple instances where it is different. Also, I only gave a FEW monsters[CR]a ton of HP. Not all of them, like before.[CR]The Easy version is what[CR]youll want to play. Its the main release.[CR]The Hard version has a very weak[CR]sword until you raise it to level 8. [CR]And I mean WEAK! That is the only[CR]difference.[CR]You might also notice the GFX are still the same... I like the[CR]Zelda II[CR]graphics, so deal with it.:P (Besides, Im not very good at GFX[CR]editing)[CR]There are A LOT of changes I made to the game, but there are 2[CR]"little" [CR]changes that will make it more challenging. Not a "ITS[CR]IMPOSSIBLE" [CR]challenging, but a "MAN, I HAVE TO WORK FOR SOMETHING"[CR]challenging. [CR]You will notice BOTH of them when you start playing the[CR]hack.[CR]Well, that is all. Enjoy the hack, and have fun.[CR]&gt;_&gt;[CR]--------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]-Updates-[CR]--------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]1.1[CR]Its a very small update, but there were a few text errors that[CR] were[CR]missed. They are fixed.[CR]1.2 There was major bug in East Hyrule. After[CR]exiting a certain cave,[CR] you would get stuck in a mountain. And also, when[CR]entering this[CR] cave, you would get damage forced upon you by a misplaced[CR]scorpion.[CR] These are now fixed.[CR]1.3 This update fixes a lot of bugs. One[CR]was found in New Kasuto. The[CR] old lady that would come out of the house[CR]would glitch and not let[CR] enter, even though you could.:P And then there[CR]were a few more minor[CR] glitches where enemies would be stuck in the ground.[CR]And there were[CR] a few levels in East Hyrule that were changed a little bit.[CR]To make[CR] it look more natural.:)[CR]1.4 Big update![CR] Another case of[CR]enemies being stuck in the ground.&gt;_&gt; [CR] In the first palace, there was a[CR]lava pit added to the room with the [CR] Blue Ironkuckle. This way he will be[CR]easier to deal with.:) Youll[CR] understand once you see it.[CR] Also, I[CR]forgot to change Old Kasuto from the start, so that is now[CR] the way I want[CR]it. [CR] The main menu text has also been changed.[CR] Final thing for this[CR]update; I was told that the Cross was almost [CR] impossible to get, so I made[CR]that A LOT easier! [CR] But only in the Easy version.&gt;:D[CR]1.5 Just a couple[CR]bugs that were fixed. They were in New Kasuto and the[CR] 6th Palace. Nothing[CR]huge.[CR]1.6 Another important update![CR] The boss room has been changed[CR]making boss fights easier. It may[CR] not seem like it, but trust me, they[CR]will be.:)[CR] You no longer need the Jump Spell to get through the 1st[CR]Palace.[CR] (Only in the Easy Version)[CR] In the end, things are[CR]prettier.^_^[CR]1.7 In the last update, I ended up creating a bug.-_- And it[CR]was a cool[CR] bug too!:P Oh well, I guess its for the best.[CR]1.8 This is[CR]the biggest update yet! [CR] There was only one glitch that was fixed and that[CR]was[CR] in Palaces 2, 3, and 6.(Same room) But in the process of [CR] fixing[CR]it, I changed a bunch of other things!:)[CR] The end of the 6th Palace has[CR]been reworked. Before it was kind of[CR] bland, but now it is exciting and[CR]new!;)[CR] There were also a lot of minor changes here and there, nothing you[CR] will really notice. They were just things I completely forgot about![CR]And that is all for this update.[CR]1.9 Another glitch found.:([CR] When you[CR]beat the 6th Palace, it would cause the overworld[CR] to glitch. I have fixed[CR]that in both[CR]versions.:)[CR]--------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]-Contact[CR]Info-[CR]--------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]If[CR]you have any questions or comments about my hack, please email me at:[CR]the_icepenguin@yahoo.com[CR]--------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]-Credits-[CR]--------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Ice[CR]Penguin......I made the hack.[CR]Dwedit...........He made the editor I used.[CR]If you want it, you can get[CR] it here:[CR]http://dwedit.home.comcast.net/[CR]Ice Ranger.......He helped me find some ROM[CR]addresses that GREATLY helped [CR] the progress of my hack! Actually, this[CR]hack wouldnt[CR] be released right now without his help! This time [CR]around, I give all credit to him!:)[CR]Trax.............For a while, I put[CR]this hack to the side and lost all[CR] interest in it.:P Then I got a random[CR]PM from Trax[CR] that was about Zelda II. In short, I started working on[CR]it again.&gt;_&lt;[CR]BETA TESTERS.....Googie!![CR]ocw[CR]--------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]All[CR]trademarks and copyrights contained in this folder are[CR]owned by their[CR]respective trademark and copyright holders.</plot>

    <plot>A completely new Zelda II adventure! Long ago, a curse was cast upon the land[CR]of Hyrule. This darkness gave rise to the minions of Ganon, allowing them to[CR]overrun Forests, Towns, and Meadows. Deep within the forest lives our young[CR]hero, Link. Guide Link across the vast Kingdom of Hyrule, and defeat the[CR]ominous shadow! What's New? * World Maps! * Dungeons! * GFX! * Music! * New[CR]Spell! * Experience Curve! * More areas to explore! * More treasure! * More[CR]Zelda! Easy Version: * Enemies deal 1x damage. * Start with 6 lives. * Link's[CR]sword is stronger. * Life spell costs 50% less magic at all levels. *[CR]Beginning town has a magic refill lady. Hard Version: * Enemies deal 2x[CR]damage. * Start with 4 lives. * Link's sword is weaker. * Life spell costs 50%[CR]less magic at level 8. While the majority of the hack was done by me, there[CR]are new surprises to find thanks to the efforts of others. Trax helped out a[CR]lot with programming and created a new spell! He also helped with improving[CR]enemies to make them more fierce! Beware of the bots. :P Enjoy the new[CR]Overworld Music thanks to optomon. He composed it perfectly and it really[CR]enhances the Zelda feel! To everyone that helped, THANK YOU! Trax, JaSp,[CR]HylianFox, ocw, Dwedit, Ice Ranger, Jigglysaint, Googie, optomon.

For all whove played the[CR]black sheep of[CR]the Zelda family and hated it, here comes an overhaul[CR]of the entire game[CR]itself.[CR]For those of you who dont know, Zelda II was one of the most[CR]anticipated games. It was also the game that gave the most[CR]dissapointment for its players. Apparently, many despised its [CR]graphics[CR]and sound, and so kicked this game away, not ever letting [CR]it see[CR]daylight.[CR]As a fan of the Zelda series, I was one of those who felt like[CR]they[CR]could have done better, and just because I was bored, I decided[CR]to[CR]prove that I could. Two years later, this is my finished product.[CR]I[CR]feel that in my own mind, that this is one of the most extensive[CR]hacks of[CR]this writing (January 29, 1999).[CR]I hope to give the emulation fans what the[CR]real spirit of this whole[CR]thing is all about, to have fun and do cool stuff[CR]with what youve[CR]got lying around. So I hope that my two years worth of[CR]boredom will[CR]give the reader of this at least two minutes of fun or more![CR];)[CR]_____________________________________________________________________[CR]"The[CR]Legend of Zelda II - The Adventure of Link" is copyright 1987[CR]Nintendo.[CR]Link, Zelda and any other thing in this game is probably[CR]copyrited by them[CR]also. I am not liable for any accidents, computer[CR]failures of any kind,[CR]loss of data of any kind, temper-tantrums, [CR]loss of sleep, bad grades, loss[CR]of hair, loss of brain, broken nails, [CR]split-ends, tarter buildup, or[CR]anything related, that may occurr while[CR]playing this game. Play at your own[CR]risk. Youve been warned.</plot>
