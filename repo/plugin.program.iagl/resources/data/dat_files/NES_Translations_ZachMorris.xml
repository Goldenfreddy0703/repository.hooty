    <plot>Have you ever been lying awake at night, thinking "wow, wouldn't it be cool if[CR]there was a board game RPG?" Well, the Ask Corporation has answered our[CR]prayers, dear boy! And as simple as a "board game RPG" might sound, 100 World[CR]Story truly defies explanation. Well, sort of. You roll dice and traverse the[CR]land, entering towns, passing through forests and killing small woodland[CR]animals, finding treasure, spending treasure, losing treasure, and enduring[CR]fetch quest after fetch quest to become strong enough to accomplish the[CR]scenario's main goal. There are two ways to win: Accomplish the main goal[CR](there's three scenarios: slay the dragon, find the legendary treasure, and[CR]rescue the princess), or have the most points (gold, equipment, etc) after all[CR]the rounds are over. Random people will give you experience, you always tend[CR]to find items lying around on the road.. It's always completely random and[CR]fun. Battles are pretty typical RPG stuff, you pick the option to fight,[CR]magic, etc. and the combat only lasts a turn before it's the next person's[CR]turn to play. It's great fun, so play the damn game.[CR]Read Me:[CR]100[CR]World Story Translation Patch[CR]Version BS.VQt (April,[CR]2007)[CR]AlanMidas(king_midas_@hotmail.com or alan@eskimobob.com or[CR]ICQ#9821147)[CR]Stuff done:[CR]AlanMidas - everything[CR]There... me... thats[CR]about it for the most part[CR]If you find any bugs in this(overlapping[CR]tex/typos/anything), please let me know. It might take a few years, but Ill[CR]try to get it fixed and put a new patch out there =)![CR]New This[CR]update:[CR]Fixed like 2 or 3 typos, nothing too dramatic.[CR]Old[CR]Updates:[CR]BS.VQ(Feb,2007)[CR]Fixed my bad hacking and typos from the last[CR]release.[CR]Special thanks:[CR]Thanks to my brother Toma for helping me with[CR]the origional font I used, and getting me into emulation.[CR]And thanks to[CR]everybody who got after me for not doing stuff for awhile so I could get it[CR]done, and for sending me typos/etc after the last version(too many people to[CR]list =p).[CR]And thanks to those people who gave nice encouraging insentive[CR]stuff too(like Spinner 8 for offerring to start hurting people if they didnt[CR]respond to my translation request... which wasnt responded too anyway... but[CR]it got done, so hey alls happy =p)[CR]ummm... thats about all I can think to[CR]put in here... so thats all folks![CR]Older updates(1998-2000):[CR]Game text[CR]translated and such</plot>

    <plot>This, I think, is the sequel to Heroes of the Lance. Heroes of the Lance is,[CR]well, barely playable, and therefore not very fun. Dragons of Flame turns the[CR]Playable up a few notches, but the game still manages to be not very fun. To[CR]me, anyways. For starters, there's an overworld now. And you can go talk to[CR]people, who respond in Japanese! Whee! And monsters run into you, Zelda II-[CR]style, and then you fight them in a side-view, also Zelda II-style. Except,[CR]the monsters beat the hell out of you and you can't really do much about it.[CR]Except heal constantly. Whee, just like a real RPG! Okay I'm done.[CR]Read[CR]Me:[CR] DvD Translations[CR] AD&amp;D; DragonLance 2 - Dragons of Flame[CR] for[CR]the Nintendo Famicom/NES[CR] Patch Version: 1.03[CR] Release Date: October[CR]31st, 2003[CR]Hello and welcome to the ReadMe file for[CR]"AD&amp;D; DragonLance 2[CR]- Dragons of Flame" for the NES.[CR]In this file Ive included info on how to[CR]use this patch,[CR]how play control differs in this game from that[CR]of[CR]"AD&amp;D; DragonLance 1 - Heroes of the Lance", and a[CR]rough[CR]walkthrough.[CR]------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Credits:[CR]DvD Translations[CR] dvdtranslations.eludevisibility.org[CR]DvD -[CR]Programmer[CR] Original English translation of menus and items[CR] Translation[CR]of characters and places[CR] Editor[CR] Alpha Tester[CR]KlD - Beta Tester[CR]Shiroi Translations[CR] yatsu.deviantart.com[CR]Shiroi - English translation[CR]of the entire[CR]script[CR]------------------------------------------------------------[CR]How[CR]to Patch the ROM file:[CR]Original Game ROM Size: 1 megabit of program ROM[CR]&amp;[CR] 1 megabit of character ROM[CR] = 2 megabit[CR] = 256 kBytes[CR] = 262144[CR]Bytes[CR]You need:[CR]1) A ROM file. The file must include the standard 16[CR]byte[CR] iNES header followed by the program ROM followed by the[CR] character[CR]ROM. This makes the ROM file 262160 Bytes in[CR] size.[CR] Im not telling you[CR]how to get the ROM file, but[CR] for this game, the format of the 16 byte iNES[CR]header[CR] should be:[CR] 4E 45 53 1A 08 10 12 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00[CR]Note: The ROM file most commonly found on the internet[CR] AD&amp;D; Dragons of[CR]Flame.nes[CR] has a corrupt header file that doesnt allow the battery[CR]backup system to work! Instead of the 12 it has a 10.[CR] Starting with patch[CR]version 1.00, if your ROM file has a[CR] header with a 10, it will be changed[CR]to a 12 by the patch[CR] which will allow the battery backup to work.[CR]2)[CR]Patch File: DoF-v1_03.IPS - Included with this file.[CR]3) An IPS patching[CR]program[CR] Recommended patching program for IBM PC:[CR] Snes-Tool.exe by The[CR]M.C.A./Elite[CR]Using SNES Tool:[CR]1) Make a copy of the un-patched ROM. You[CR]always want to[CR] keep the un-patched ROM around for later revisions of[CR]the patch.[CR]2) Place an un-patched ROM file with header (Ill call it[CR]DoF.nes), DoF-v1_03.IPS, and Snes-Tool.exe in the same[CR] directory.[CR]3)[CR]Run Snes-Tool.exe[CR]4) Type U for "Use IPS"[CR]5) Press the down arrow key[CR]until DOF-V1_03.IPS is[CR] highlighted.[CR]6) Hit Enter.[CR]7) Press the down[CR]arrow key until DOF.NES is highlighted.[CR]8) Hit Enter.[CR]9) Hit Q to[CR]quit.[CR]Note: If patching the file on a Mac, I recommend[CR]UIPS.[CR]------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Why[CR]I, DvD, chose to translate any game:[CR] I wanted to give back to the[CR]translation community[CR] after playing so many excellently translated[CR]games[CR] such as Tales of Phantasia for the SNES by DeJap,[CR] Final Fantasy[CR]II for the NES by NeoDemiforce, and[CR] Final Fantasy III for the NES by Alex[CR]W. Jackson,[CR] Neill Corlett, and SoM2Freak. I really appreciate all[CR] that[CR]have gone and translated before me.[CR]Why I chose to translate THIS[CR]game:[CR]1) I wanted to translate an action/adventure or RPG[CR] that everyone[CR]knew something about. Yes, this game[CR] is the sequel to the infamous AD&amp;D;[CR]DragonLance - Heroes[CR] of the Lance, rightly voted one of the worst[CR]games[CR] ever released in the US for the NES. What is[CR] amazing about this[CR]game is that all the things that[CR] made the original game so bad (terrible[CR]player control,[CR] no ability to regain health except using magic which[CR]is almost impossible to replenish) have been fixed in[CR] this game. Try it[CR]out. I think youll be pleasantly[CR] surprised.[CR]2) Ive played and passed[CR]all the prequels to this game.[CR] It just has the one. I have this thing[CR]about playing[CR] games that are part of a series in the order in which[CR]they came out...[CR]3) This game only uses Hiragana and Katakana, no[CR]kanji.[CR] Plus it has a nice Roman character font on the same[CR] character[CR]table.[CR]4) I wanted to do an NES game. I have a lot of experience[CR] with[CR]machine language of the 6502 processor.[CR]5) I liked the game and wished I[CR]could play it in English.[CR]6) AD&amp;D; starts with A. It was one of the first[CR]that I[CR] considered...[CR]Why YOU should bother playing THIS game:[CR]1)[CR]This is a COMPLETE translation. I worked my ass off to[CR] make sure that ALL[CR]of Shirois translation made it into[CR] the final patch. It was not easy. I[CR]had to get pretty[CR] creative moving code around and filling in tiny[CR]unused[CR] portions of code with strings.[CR]2) This is an accurate[CR]translation. After Shiroi translated[CR] the script, I researched the correct[CR]spelling of all the[CR] character names and places in the HotL manual, the[CR]PC[CR] version of this game, and on DragonLance web sites.[CR]3) See what a[CR]vast improvement this is over the prequel![CR]4) Its the only official D&amp;D;[CR]game, released on the Famicom,[CR] that wasnt released in the US; see what[CR]youre missing![CR]5) Its very different from the PC released version of[CR]this[CR] game.[CR]6) Its quite short.[CR]7) You wont get stuck or need a[CR]walkthrough...[CR] so why am I including one in the doc?[CR]8) KlD says, "This[CR]game was enjoyable to play. Im more of[CR] a turn-based RPG player, but the[CR]action wasnt difficult[CR] and was actually sort of fun."[CR]Why i, shiroi,[CR]chose to translate this game:[CR] i looked on the Whirlpool want ads and saw[CR]it. :o i chose[CR] this one specifically because it wasnt too big, and im[CR]something of a closet D&amp;D; fan. anyhow, then i got in[CR] touch with DvD and i[CR]was really struck by the amount of[CR] interest he showed in doing it right,[CR]as in adhering to[CR] the proper names and places. thus, i was motivated[CR]to[CR] whip through the script and do my best.[CR] please[CR]enjoy.[CR]------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Game[CR]Controls and Tips:[CR]1) If you havent played Heroes of the Lance before,[CR]you[CR] should read its manual. Actually, the manual is the[CR] best thing[CR]about the game! The story line and characters[CR] for this game are identical[CR]to the prequel. The[CR] controls, spells, and items are similar but are[CR]improved[CR] in this game. With a little research you should be able[CR] to[CR]find a text copy of the HotL manual on the internet.[CR] I own a copy of the[CR]HotL with manual, but before writing[CR] this I checked and I was able to find[CR]a text manual for[CR] the NES version of HotL on the net.[CR]2) Controls[CR]*[CR]Start : Start the Game[CR] Display the Main Menu[CR]* B-button : Swing your[CR]Weapon[CR] Cancel menu command[CR] Back up one menu[CR] Advance Text[CR] Speed[CR]Up Text - When possible[CR]* A-button : Jump[CR] Select menu command[CR]Advance Text[CR] Speed Up Text - When possible[CR]* Directional Pad[CR] +[CR]Overworld:[CR] - U,D,L,&amp;R; : Move character N,S,E,&amp;W;[CR] + Underworld or[CR]Fighting:[CR] - L and R : Move character left or right[CR] - D : Duck[CR] Pick[CR]up item[CR] Aim weapon down when swinging it[CR] [CR] - U : Aim weapon up when[CR]swinging it[CR] [CR]3) The Main Menu, Clerical Spells Menu, and[CR] Magic User[CR]Spells Menu scroll up and down. This is[CR] because they all have more items[CR]than can be shown[CR] on the screen at one time.[CR]4) Use "Hero Select" to[CR]swap the position of 2 characters.[CR]5) Rest often and swap first characters[CR]to keep your[CR] HP up. After resting once, youll a have to wait[CR] a while[CR]before it will let you rest again. In the[CR] overworlds, you cannot rest if[CR]you are in a[CR] battle. In the underworlds, you cannot rest if there[CR] is[CR]one or more monsters in the hallway you currently[CR] occupy. The game lets[CR]you know if you successfully[CR] rested or not.[CR]6) All characters start[CR]with 255 HP.[CR] Spell points are as follows:[CR]Raistlin starts with 255[CR]MP.[CR]Spell MP Used[CR]------------------- --------[CR]Charm 16 See HotL[CR]manual[CR]Sleep 21 "[CR]Magic Missile 16 "[CR]Web 32 "[CR]Burning Hands 21[CR]"[CR]Fire Ball 32 Attack with a ball of fire[CR]Goldmoon starts with 255[CR]MP.[CR]Spell MP Used What It Does[CR]------------------- --------[CR]------------[CR]Cure Light Wounds 5 Raise 1 living characters HP[CR] by 51[CR]points (20% of 255)[CR]Hold Person 16 See HotL manual[CR]Spiritual Hammer 6[CR]"[CR]Bless 6 ?[CR]Dispel Magic 6 ?[CR]Heal 16 Raise 1 living characters HP[CR]by 127 points (50% of 255)[CR]Turn Undead 16 Attacks undead on the[CR]screen[CR]Cure Critical Wounds 21 Raise 1 living characters HP[CR] by 204[CR]points (80% of 255)[CR]Raise Dead 48 Raise 1 dead characters HP[CR] to 51[CR]points (20% of 255)[CR]6) To equip a weapon or a piece of armor, GIVE[CR] it[CR]to the person who you want to equip it on and then USE[CR] it while it is in[CR]that persons inventory. If they can[CR] equip it, it will move from the items[CR]section to the[CR] equipment section.[CR]7) To throw a projectile weapon, it[CR]must be in the items[CR] section of the character who wishes to use it.[CR]Also,[CR] that character must be the first in the party.[CR] Select the[CR]projectile (arrow, pouch of bullets, javelin,[CR] etc.) with the USE command.[CR]Only certain characters can[CR] use certain projectile weapons. If it doesnt[CR]work for[CR] one character try it with a different[CR]one.[CR]------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Quick[CR]Walkthrough - Contains "spoilers":[CR] The goal of the first overworld is to[CR]make it to the man[CR] just north of the Pax Tharkas fortress in the far[CR]south west corner, Gilthanas. Do this after meeting all[CR] the other men to[CR]follow the story, one of which gives you[CR] a Potion of Healing.[CR] The goal[CR]of the second overworld is to make it to the[CR] cave in the south west after[CR]visiting Theros in the cave[CR] in the north east.[CR] Both underworlds[CR]contain a number of useful items not[CR] listed here.[CR] The goal of the[CR]first underworld, Sla Mori, is to find[CR] the Wyrmslayer and then find the[CR]entrance to Pax Tharkas.[CR] The goal of the second underworld, Pax Tharkas,[CR]is fight[CR] the goblin, meet the first dragon, the Old Sage, defeat[CR] the[CR]second dragon, Ember, and then defeat[CR]Verminaard.[CR]------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Translation[CR]Progress History:[CR]Patch Version Release Date[CR]-------------[CR]---------------[CR]none December 21st, 2002 - Project Begins[CR]* Thingy[CR]character table first generated[CR]0.40 June 18th, 2003 - Initial Public[CR]Release[CR]* Menu Screens - Complete except for the screen[CR] - Start, Save,[CR]Load, telling you to hold reset while[CR] and Main menus turning off the NES[CR]power[CR] - Magic User Spells[CR] - Clerical Spells[CR]* Command Screens -[CR]Complete[CR] - Hero Select[CR] - Use/Drop/Give[CR]* Items - Complete[CR]*[CR]Command Feedback - Complete[CR]* Title Screen Hack - Complete *[CR]* Event[CR]Text - Dumped[CR]* Original PC Text - Dumped[CR]* Intro/Ending Text - Ready[CR]for dumping[CR]* Ending Credits Hack - Untouched[CR]none August 21st,[CR]2003[CR]* DvD first contacted by Shiroi.[CR]none August 31st, 2003[CR]* Event[CR]Text - Shiroi finished translating[CR]* Intro/Ending Text - Dumped[CR] -[CR]Shiroi finished translating[CR]0.60 September 12th, 2003 - Shiroi Release[CR]*[CR]Title Screen Hack - Complete - Shiroi Added[CR]* Intro/Ending Text -[CR]Complete[CR]* Ending Credits Hack - Complete *[CR]1.00 October 22nd, 2003 -[CR]Beta Testing Release[CR]* Menu Screens - Complete [CR]* Event Text - Complete[CR]*[CR]1.02 October 28th, 2003 - Shiroi Release[CR] [CR]* Event Text -[CR]Tasslehoff "trap" event text finally[CR] executed in game and so it was[CR]fixed[CR]* Ending Credits Hack - Test Player changed to KlD[CR]1.03 October[CR]31st, 2003 - Complete Public Release[CR] [CR]* Event Text - Minor edits in Old[CR]Sage intro &amp;[CR] Raistlin death [CR]* Intro/Ending Text - Minor edits of last[CR]screen of intro[CR] and last 5 speeches of[CR]ending[CR]------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Thank[CR]You:[CR]DvD wishes to thank Shiroi for her very quick and[CR]complete[CR]translation.

    <plot>Um, this is a platform game. Your cute dinosaur character walks around and[CR]farts on his enemies (which, by the way, has a very limited range) and that's[CR]basically it.

Also this game is part of the GameBoy series that was[CR]released in the United States and in Japan. However this game is quite[CR]different in some aspects. [CR]You play as Asmik, who is called Boomer in the[CR]United States and english versions of the GameBoy games. You have a tail whip[CR]that kills enemies and also you can select a menu where you can use powers[CR]that you purchase from the shops. Your job is to collect the 6 fragments to[CR]awaken the sleeping dragon god and end the chaos and to get rid of the[CR]monsters from this land.[CR]Update History[CR]-----------------[CR]Version[CR]0.25[CR]Quite buggy and a lot of things needs working out.[CR]06 - 26 -[CR]2003[CR]Patching Details[CR]-----------------[CR]1.)Use SNES Tool to patch the[CR]rom.[CR]2.)Make sure the "good name" is Asmik Kun Land (J).nes . The size of[CR]the rom should be 256KB after being unzipped.[CR]Emulation[CR]Details[CR]------------------[CR]This game is mapper #4 and you should not[CR]have a problem finding a NES emulator to run the game.[CR]Known[CR]Issues[CR]------------------[CR]There is plenty of known issues for this game.[CR]First of all this game crashes at the very last level and could be a[CR]dumping/emulation issue, as it crashes even with a fresh unhacked rom. Also[CR]the script translation is not entirely accurate,and there is grammar errors[CR]and such.

    <plot>The player must earn money in order to become the wealthiest gambler in the world. The game, set in New York City, is considered a spin-off from the Pachio-kun franchise.[CR]Roads, taxis and automobiles are not portrayed in the game. However, a black limousine that escorts the player from the air force base to the final casino is portrayed as driving on grass. This is in direct opposition to the real New York City where the majority of the surface is concrete (either as roads, parking lots, or as foundations for the buildings). Only parks and some older residential districts use grass in their design in the real world. Buildings are either shown as dilapidated tenements, shiny towers, or as flashy casinos.[CR]The player starts out in the poorest district of Brooklyn and must work through the boroughs of New York City outside Manhattan, including Queens or The Bronx, in order to amass wealth. With luck and finesse, the player can ultimately break the bank in New Jersey. To enter a casino, the player must find a permit (which serves as photo identification for the casinos) somewhere in Brooklyn. Slot machines come in denominations from $1-$100000 depending on the neighborhood and the presence of a VIP card. Three types of slot machines can be played at each level and the player is photographed when winning the jackpot.[CR]Players must be wary of dice games that have dangerous risks in addition to card games - they randomly appear like monster battles in traditional role-playing games. Many buildings including airports, police stations, and casinos either help or hinder the player's attempts to earn enough money on the slot machines for passage to the wealthier district. Guns (in the form of a pistol) can be found that can protect the player against muggers. However, the police will confiscate the weapon from this player once he arrives at a certain area in Manhattan. Pachiko-kun (the player) will also be arrested and will be held unless a $100,000 ($190,899.33 in today's money) bail can be paid in full.</plot>

    <plot>This is one of Konami's first NES games from way back in the day, and the[CR]possible origin for their old obsession with penguins. In Antarctic Adventure,[CR]you play the role of a penguin that goes around the South Pole on a race,[CR]visiting different stations for no reason at all. On the way you'll have to[CR]brave holes and seals while trying to catch fish and flags for extra points.[CR]Grab a flashing flag and you'll get a special boost which allows you to float[CR]for a few seconds once while jumping. There's not much else to do in this game[CR]other than go forward and beat the clock.

Our only guess[CR]is[CR]that the Japanese word for "Eventually" was really put there[CR]to rhyme[CR]with the Japanese word for "Antarctic" so, in that[CR]light, we could call[CR]it:[CR]"Avalanche-ly Antarctic Adventure"[CR]But, as it doesnt sound that[CR]good, we suggest sticking[CR]with the in-game English name.[CR]In this file[CR]Ive included info on how to use the patch[CR]and how to[CR]play.[CR]------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Credits:[CR]DvD Translations[CR] dvdtranslations.eludevisibility.org[CR]DvD - Tile[CR]editor[CR] - Tester[CR] - ReadMe author[CR]Shiroi - Translations:[CR] * "South[CR]Pole"[CR] * "Avalanche-ly Antarctic[CR]Adventure"[CR]------------------------------------------------------------[CR]A[CR]little history of Konami and the NES[CR]Original game ROM size: 1 16k program[CR]ROM bank[CR] &amp;[CR] 1 8k character ROM bank[CR] = 24 kBytes[CR] = 24576[CR]Bytes[CR]Games designed for the original Famicom/NES hardware could[CR]be 1 or[CR]2 16k program banks and 1 8k character bank.

    <plot>Armadillo is the name of an NES/Family Computer platform video game, published by IGS in 1991.[CR]The player controls a yellow armadillo with a red hat named Billy the Shell. Before each level, the player gets to move around on a board game-type screen, reminiscent of Super Mario Bros. 3. There are a lot of small squares, and the player can move on them one at a time. There are also some larger squares with pictures on them, and if the player is on them, he/she can choose to begin an action stage, which has to be cleared before the player can pass it. There is also another character moving around on the board, and if the player is on the same space as him, they can choose to be sent into a boss battle, which has to be cleared to move onto the next world.</plot>

Also the way the rom is[CR]it[CR]wont allow us to use any space for[CR]the main text that exceeds this 4K[CR]bank.[CR]So this posed to be a slight problem.[CR]We were looking to expand[CR]out the text[CR]but because of this restriction we had[CR]to make use of the[CR]space we had. Which[CR]meant shortening the scripts as much as[CR]possible,[CR]yet keeping in the whole story.[CR]Then we get to the menu texts and[CR]items[CR]and stuff. Now this text was easy to[CR]utilize the space we needed[CR]for it.[CR]The only problem with this text is[CR]each string must be an exact[CR]size. If we make[CR]some of the things stored here too big[CR]or too small[CR]they will not display correctly[CR]so we had to use a couple of[CR]those[CR]doubled up tiles (you know.. like 3 letters[CR]squished into 2 tiles[CR]on the font table),[CR]but dont worry, it still looks great![CR]We also[CR]designed some Icons for the[CR]weapons and Items to allow us to use[CR]longer[CR]names for them.[CR]-------------------------------------------[CR]Known[CR]Bugs:[CR]Theres always gotta be some![CR]Anyways, when talking to an[CR]Innkeeper,[CR]the small window in the top left reads as[CR]"Innk".

    <plot>This game is something of a mix between Rad Racer and Battle Cars on the SNES.[CR]You drive around in this silver car that can change shape and become thinner,[CR](A pretty useless feature, as you can't shoot in this mode) shooting missiles[CR]at cars that get in the way, all while trying to not run out of fuel. The[CR]problem is, the tracks are REALLY long, you only have a finite amount of[CR]missiles (You can buy some though by trading points at stores that pop up now[CR]and then, and other items of interest), and if you run out while fighting one[CR]of the bosses, you're screwed into having to start the entire track over.[CR]Which is really bad considering that means you have to listen to the music[CR]again. Seriously, the music in this game is easily some of the worst I've[CR]heard on the NES. It sounds like a couple of retarded circus monkeys on crack[CR]got a hold of a cheap ass Casio keyboard and had an hour long jam session. But[CR]wait, there's hope! If you read the readme (and you always read them, don't[CR]you?), you'll find out that if you hit select while playing the game, you can[CR]turn it off! Despite all the flaws and horrendously cheap scenarios in the[CR]game (Dont' even get me started on the cheap ass spaceship(?) fight that[CR]happens after you kill a boss.), I really like this game, enough to where I[CR]didn't stop playing until I beat it.

    <plot>This game's a Space Harrier clone. It's not a -bad- Space Harrier clone, but[CR]it's not a particularly good one either. The music is kinda catchy, the[CR]graphics are decent - especially the fact that your little heroine character[CR]will change outfits if the level you're playing warrants it, which is quite a[CR]nice touch - but the fact of the matter is that she moves just a liiiiiittle[CR]too slowly, you can only fire two or three shots at a time, and the screen is[CR]usually filled with so much stuff that it's almost impossible to survive.

    <plot>Battle Wings, known in Japan either as B-Wing, is a vertically scrolling shooter first released as an arcade game by Data East in 1984. The game was ported by Data East to the Family Computer in 1986, and was Data East's very first home release for this platform.[CR]The game consists of 45 levels (30 in the Family Computer version), and no background story or plot is given. The player controls a ship called the FX-1, and collects power-up parts (called a "wing") to progress through the levels and ultimately defeat the Gobunasu armored mobile fortress in the final level. The game consists of two different top-view screen levels, where the player can press the second button to descend to the ground whenever they do not have a power-up. The player is unaffected by attacks from airborne units while they are playing on the ground level, but the ship is automatically brought back into the air after a certain period of time. The player can still be hit by attacks from ground units while they are on the ground level, and can also lose their ship by crashing into obstacles. The 8-way joystick controls the player's movements, and one button is used for shooting, and the other is used for descending to the ground (or un-equipping wings). The background image continues infinitely when the player scrolls in the horizontal directions.[CR]Completing the final level of the game causes the score counter to increase to 9,999,999 points, which the player can enter as their high score. The player can also score cheap points by equipping and un-equipping their power-up. Pressing the button twice while the un-equipping animation is occurring cause the player to gain 2,000 points. The player gains an extra life every 40,000 points, so it is possible to gain lives almost infinitely. If the player gains over 10,000,000 points in this way before completing the final level, the counter takes over 20 minutes to increase to 99,999,999 points.</plot>

    <plot>The player gets to control a mole which digs through dirt collecting various fruits and vegetables. In most stages, the produce must be collected in a specific order, or the player may become stuck and be forced to restart the stage. During the stages, the player must also retrieve a female mole;[1] referred to in the instruction manual as the player's daughter-in-law. When all objectives are complete, the player must make his way to the exit.[1] If the player dies, his character says something along the lines of "I'm beat.</plot>

    <plot>Not many games are audacious enough as to make you play the entire game as a[CR]baby. I mean, you're not even some kind of genius super baby, like in Captain[CR]Commando! You fucking crawl around on the ground. And when you get all powered[CR]up, you walk on your feet, and it's just the most amazing damn thing you've[CR]ever seen. It's like when you see Professor Xavier walk around in the X-Men[CR]movies and you're all wowed, and then you're like, "oh duh, of COURSE Patrick[CR]Stewart can frickin' walk." And your weapon? A rattle. Honestly, your baby[CR]character isn't very Bio Miraculous, but your rattle is pretty kickass. You[CR]can whack a monster with it and it'll get big and float away. Then you can[CR]jump on top of it and ride on top of it for a little while. Or, you can jump[CR]into it, and it'll fly off and hit other enemies. This is how you get rid of[CR]the bosses. Pretty clever! They try and mix it up with a SMB2-style digging[CR]level (think World 2/World 6) and a swimming level and stuff, but it just gets[CR]annoying. The game proper is a lot of fun, though.[CR]Read[CR]Me:[CR]~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~[CR]Bio Miracle - Boku-tte Upa!!

    <plot>This game is a port of the original Arcade version and was released exclusively in Japan.[CR]This version features several substantial differences from the Arcade version. The player now has a health gauge and can take more than one hit before losing a life (which can be replenished by picking up hearts). However, some of the enemy grunts now take more than one slice to defeat as well. The player can now purchase all weapon power-ups in item shops, which can be changed through a sub-menu. The stages are different and the bosses include new foes such as Frankenstein's monster and a giant octopus. The player can enter houses and rooms where an old lady will offer advice to the player (such as an enemy's weak point). However, some of the old ladies the player will encounter are hostile and will bring a curse to the player (like reducing his health by half). The ending varies depending on whether the player used a continue to finish the game.</plot>

    <plot>This seems like a kinda spiffy side-scrolling adventure romp in the vein of[CR]Zelda 2, Faxanadu, or Battle of Olympus. Most of the game revolves around[CR]jumping and stabbing and exploring. Of course, you run into people along the[CR]way who try to pawn their advice and goods off on you.

    <plot>This game is so ridiculously easy ... it's ridiculous! It's a platformer,[CR]where you can choose which stage you want to play, then play through with one[CR]of five characters. There's really no difference between the characters,[CR]except that two are armed with a sword, two are armed with a gun, and one is[CR]armed with their fist (although I guess that would make them unarmed). It[CR]really makes no difference, though. A blind, lame, mentally deficient mule[CR]could beat this game. But that's not to say the game is bad though. Just easy.[CR]It also looks like it's based on an anime or something, due to the fact that[CR]the characters combine and transform into a transformer-looking giant robot.[CR]You don't see that very often in an Nes game unless it's based on something.[CR]Unfortunately, there is so little text in the game, it never really explains[CR]it. Either way, if you like platformers, give it a try.[CR]Read[CR]Me:[CR]Choujin Sentai Jetman English Version[CR]Version 1.00[CR]Released May[CR]28, 2000[CR]Introduction[CR]------------[CR]I still have a hard time deciding[CR]if this is should be called a translation[CR]or merely a hack. But I guess if[CR]groups like Suicidal Translations can[CR]translate Sanrio games which hardly[CR]have any text and call them translations,[CR]I suppose I can do the same.[CR]=P[CR]Installation[CR]------------[CR]Just use the patch like you would with[CR]any other patch.

    <plot>Tapir, an enigmatic blue wizard in spotted pajamas from the Dream World, sends the player on a quest to rescue princess Rua. But things quickly become more complicated and the player soon has to rescue other characters along the way, such as Santa Claus, the king of Trump castle and the blue fairy Cocoron. Tapir can manipulate people's dreams and this ability gives Cocoron an unique twist - the player can assemble his own character by combining one of the eight available heads to one of the eight available bodies (which both include several designs to choose from, resulting in literally hundreds of combinations! ). More than a mere physical appearance, each part also defines the character's attributes, such as his health, speed, how high he can jump and so forth.</plot>

    <plot>Cosmic Wars (kozumitsukuuozu Kozumikku Wozu?) is a turn-based strategy video game produced by Konami in 1989 which is based upon the characters and conflicts of the popular Gradius series. It was released only in Japan. The game received a sequel in 1997, with Paro Wars, which is the Parodius equivalent of this game.[CR]The object of Cosmic Wars is to utilize an army composed of Gradius characters (Vic Vipers, and Big Cores) and battle enemies in various star systems. The player can be either the Bacterion Empire or the forces of Gradius. There are many different unit types, ranging from small fighters to large capital ships.</plot>

    <plot>Cosmo Police Galivan puts the player in control of a human being armed with a beam blade, which is only able to attack monsters in close proximity. As the game continues, the player character can use different powers - some ranged - to take out enemies and progress further. Eventually, the player will have the option of becoming a metal-armored officer with considerably more fire-power, though this power-up state will vanish if too much damage is taken. The player character will also level-up after destroying so many enemies, improving their health and "cosmo points" - a stat similar to mana that is used to power the player character's special attacks.[CR]The game's world is a network of caves that the player can explore for necessary items and bonus areas. The NES version expands this aspect, providing some Metroidvania-esque exploration. Some impediments are in place to restrict further exploration until the right item is found, as well.</plot>

    <plot>Asuka and Maya are typical high-school students living in Tokyo. Even though their parents were archaeologists, they lived a rather mundane life. But then one day, the same ominous dream that the two siblings were having lately suddenly became a reality. The seven monsters that sunk down the land of Atlantis and destroyed most of the ancient civilizations 10,000 years ago has suddenly revived.[CR]Modern weapons were no use against the strange weapons of Atlantis. The entire world was engulfed in the flames of war and it did not take long for the hands of evil to reach Japan.[CR]Asuka and Maya's parents, who were caught in an attack, revealed the truth to their children during their dying moment - they were not Asuka and Maya's true parents. During an archaeological trip on a deserted island 17 years ago, the couple discovered an Aurawing, an aircraft built by the ancient Mu civilization. Inside the aircraft there was a life-support system containing a pair of infants. Indeed, Asuka and Maya were actually the children of a brave warrior from Mu who fought against Atlantis 10,000 years ago.[CR]Asuka and Maya, now awakened to their true destiny, are the only hope mankind has against Atlantis. The siblings board on their respective Aurawing ships, each possessing a mystical power, as they fly off to a continent shrouded in dark clouds.</plot>

    <plot>As I mentioned in the hack description, this game appears to be some sort of[CR]Metal Gear/Rambo and maybe even a Braddock ripoff. Anyway it's a standard[CR]action game where you run around shooting bad guys and getting power-ups along[CR]the way. The bosses are pretty standard except for the last one, which is an[CR]evil Buddhist god or something. Maybe the point the developers were trying to[CR]make was that not only are we trying to destroy the bad guys, but their[CR]religion as well, which is evil.[CR]Read Me:[CR]Cross Fire"[CR]Traduccion[CR]al Espanol v1.0 (23/03/2017)[CR] POR[CR]JONYVILLA2088[CR]---------------------------[CR]1.

    <plot>Oh great, it's one of these things. You know, one of those text adventure[CR]games that nobody likes. I'm not trying to trivialize the genre or anything,[CR]but...well, the ability to really enjoy this type of game has more to do with[CR]a quality that one possesses - a virtue, if you will - that I unfortunately[CR]lack. Patience, I think it's called. If you, on the other hand, are a patient[CR]person who is also a fan of text adventure games...you're probably going to[CR]still be disappointed by Crystal Dragon. If you're wondering what it's like,[CR]think Snatcher, only without all the good stuff. That's pretty much it. The[CR]graphics are often laughably bad, the controls are unnecessarily obtuse (hold[CR]B and push left and right to flip through menu options? what the hell ever,[CR]man), and there's NO MUSIC. None whatsoever! Well, except for the blippy title[CR]screen piece, but that's it. Sound effects are pretty damned sparse, as well.[CR]In fact, the whole experience is about as basic and primitive as it can[CR]possibly be for a game of this type, which almost gives it sort of an[CR]endearing quality, but not quite. But hey, it's a Square game, so.[CR]Read[CR]Me:[CR]Crystal Dragon (FDS) [Suishou no Dragon][CR]Mutes English Patch[CR](Version 1.0)[CR]http://mute.vblank.net/[CR]The interstellar shuttle your[CR]friends were on has[CR]mysteriously disappeared, so youve flown out[CR]to[CR]investigate. Before you can find them, however, youre[CR]attacked by a[CR]fiercely territorial dragon. You only survive[CR]thanks to the timely[CR]intervention of a crystal-eyed woman[CR]who warns you not to pull any more[CR]stunts. So begins Crystal[CR]Dragon, over the course of which youll pull[CR]basically[CR]nothing BUT reckless stunts in an attempt to find out[CR]what[CR]happened to your friends.[CR]You get around in the game with the[CR]standard set of[CR]adventure game commands, represented here by a row of[CR]icons[CR]at the top of the screen. To perform the currently[CR]highlighted[CR]command, press the A button. To switch commands,[CR]hold B and press left or[CR]right till youre at the one you[CR]want. For reference, here are the[CR]individual icons:[CR] MOVE (arrows) :[CR] Once you select Move, a white arrow[CR]will pop up[CR] somewhere in the window. To follow it, press A again. To[CR]choose a different direction, press B. Some areas have[CR] only one way out,[CR]others have more than four -- either[CR] way the B button will let you cycle[CR]through your[CR] options.[CR] LOOK (eye) :[CR] Area descriptions appear[CR]automatically, but if you want[CR] to investigate a specific object, move the[CR]cursor over[CR] it and then use Look.[CR] TAKE (hand)[CR] TALK (mouth)[CR] USE[CR](fist) :[CR] When you select Use, the first item in your inventory[CR] will[CR]show up in the text box. Scroll through your items[CR] by pressing up or down,[CR]then press A when youve arrived[CR] at the correct one.[CR] OPEN (door)[CR]OPERATE (button) :[CR] You wont need the Operate command very often, but[CR]try[CR] it out on any machinery you find.[CR] DROP (trash) :[CR] Drop can mean[CR]either PLACE an item in a certain spot, or[CR] GIVE it to someone.[CR] SAVE /[CR]LOAD (disk) :[CR] The game will let you continue as often as you like, so[CR]the only reason to save is if youre turning it off.[CR] Exception: there is an[CR]action you can take, late in the[CR] game, to lock yourself out of victory,[CR]and, at that[CR] point, no amount of continues will help you.[CR]With most of[CR]these, you first have to select the object of[CR]the command by moving the[CR]cursor around. If youre shooting[CR]somebody, for example, be sure to aim[CR]before you select[CR]Use-&gt;Pistol. Also, the start button will cancel an[CR]action:[CR]if youre getting ready to use the pistol and you realize[CR]you[CR]havent aimed, just press start. This also works with[CR]movement and the disk[CR]operations.[CR]Other than that, youre ready to start playing. Good luck![CR] *[CR]* *[CR]Pretty much any FDS emulator will load the game, although[CR]some of em[CR]-- notably Loopynes and Famtasia -- have[CR]problems during the disk swapping[CR]routines. For details on[CR]obtaining, running, or patching the disk image,[CR]see your[CR]local emulation site.[CR]This patch was created with UIPS, Hex[CR]Workshop, and some[CR]perl scripts I wrote. Thingy and Tile Layer Pro were a[CR]great[CR]help in identifying relevant data early on, and Nestens[CR]debugger[CR]came in handy as well. Thanks not only to the[CR]authors of those programs but[CR]to everyone whose freely[CR]offered utilities and resources continue to make[CR]this[CR]romhacking thing possible.[CR] -- Mute (January 8, 03)</plot>

    <plot>Deep Dungeon is a series of first-person RPGs that was developed by Square[CR](but oft-published by other companies).

That is because the game is programmed to[CR] only have 1[CR]byte for damage caused (255 limit).[CR] Also, when you get defeated in battle,[CR]you get an option to return to a save[CR] point, or rise from where you died.[CR]The second option doesnt actually do[CR]anything.[CR]*********************[CR]PATCHING[CR]INSTRUCTIONS[CR]*********************[CR] First, you must use the included FDS[CR]Disk Image Expansion program.[CR] Give it your DD disk image filename.[CR]Then the next prompt will ask you to name a new file. This will be an[CR]expanded[CR] copy of the Japanese game.[CR] Then it will ask you for the[CR]expanded file list. Give it the included file[CR] dd1_expand.txt[CR] Lasltly,[CR]you will want to add a .fds header if your disk image doesnt have one.[CR] (if[CR]FDS appears on the first line when opening the original game[CR] image in a[CR]hex editor, it has a header)[CR] Then apply the IPS to the EXPANDED game image[CR]using your favorite patcher.[CR] [CR]****************[CR]EMULATION[CR]ISSUES[CR]****************[CR] Should work in any emulator supporting the FDS[CR](that is, most recent emulators).[CR] Youll need the FDS BIOS ROM. Dont ask me[CR]for it. Itll need to be named[CR] DISKSYS.ROM, and probably be put in the same[CR]folder as your emulators executable.[CR]*****************[CR]PLAY[CR]INSTRUCTIONS[CR]*****************[CR] CONTROLS:[CR] D-pad: Move cursor[CR]Left/Right - turn[CR] Up - move forward.[CR] Select: Open save menu. Press[CR]Select to choose Save Game or to Continue,[CR] without saving, and press Start[CR]to confirm.[CR] Start: This was probably meant to pause the game, but this[CR]doesnt stop the flow[CR] of time, enemies will still randomly attack. So, as a[CR]result, all it does is[CR] stop the music temporarily.[CR] B Button: Switch[CR]between menu and movement mode, and to cancel options.[CR] A Button: Open[CR]doors and confirm menu options.[CR] Your goal is to manuver through the 3D[CR]dungeon to access the next floor,[CR] until you reach the end of the game.[CR]On the top of the dungeon, you can access various services from the[CR]townspeople[CR] of Dorl.[CR] Services in the town of Dorl:[CR] Castle - talk[CR]to the King.[CR] Inn - spend a night to recover all of your HP.[CR] Item,[CR]weapon, and armor shop - Buy stuff.[CR] You can only hold one of each[CR]equipment type, and must sell the old one.[CR] You can also just sell the old[CR]one, if you wanted to for some reason.[CR] Descend - enter the dungeon.[CR]Inside the dungeon:[CR] Status indicators:[CR] Level - your experience level.[CR]Higher levels I think affect the probability[CR] of spells working and such.[CR]Also, enemies will run away at higher levels.[CR] AP - Attack power. Higher[CR]values increase the limit of damage that can be done.[CR] But note that the[CR]game randomizes the amount actually done, so even with the[CR] maximum AP,[CR]youll still do a lot of weak blows.[CR] AC - Armor class.

    <plot>Deep Dungeon: Yuushi no Monshou is a role playing game for the Family Computer[CR]Disk System. The game was released in Japan only.[CR]Read Me:[CR]Deep[CR]Dungeon II - The Heros Crest[CR]v1.0[CR]October 21, 2010[CR]KingMike[CR]Translations[CR](http://kingmike.emxuxhaven.net)[CR]***********[CR]INTROUCTION[CR]***********[CR]This[CR]is the continuation of Deep Dungeon - The Heretic War, for the Famicom Disk[CR]System.[CR]This game is also for the Famicom Disk System, released only five[CR]months after the[CR]original.[CR]In the time the last game, strange things[CR]have happened at the town of Dorl.[CR]A proclomation was made that Ruu has[CR]been resurrected. The people gathered[CR]in the temple to pray, until the[CR]swordsman Ral had been summoned by the[CR]heavens to enter the castle and[CR]fight Ruu.[CR]****[CR]TEAM[CR]****[CR] KingMike - tools, assembly,[CR]translation[CR] snark - translation[CR] Darkness Savior, Paul Jensen - spot[CR]translations[CR]***********[CR]WHATS DONE[CR]***********[CR] Should be[CR]complete.[CR]************[CR]WHATS BUGGY[CR]************[CR] Original game[CR]bug: Reach the (secret) maximum experience level, and the game[CR] gives you[CR]so many bonus points it will glitch and display your remaining points[CR] in[CR]hex, as it is the only level to give you a double-digit bonus.[CR] Oh well,[CR]its a secret and doesnt affect play, so I didnt bother to fix it.[CR] No[CR]translation bugs Im aware of.[CR]*********************[CR]PATCHING[CR]INSTRUCTIONS[CR]*********************[CR] You will need to unpack the tools[CR]archive with 7-zip (www.7-zip.org).[CR] First, you must use the included FDS[CR]Disk Image Expansion program.[CR] Give it your DD disk image filename.[CR]Then the next prompt will ask you to name a new file. This will be an[CR]expanded[CR] copy of the Japanese game.[CR] Then it will ask you for the[CR]expanded file list. Give it the included file[CR] dd2_expand.txt[CR] The[CR]program will ask what to do with the header. Choose the "force removal"[CR]option,[CR] as the patch is meant for an un-headered image.[CR] Then apply the[CR]IPS to the EXPANDED game image using your favorite patcher.[CR] I recommend[CR]LunarIPS if you want to apply the IPS patch, or upset (byuu.org) for the[CR]UPS patch, which can be used to patch or unpatch the translation.[CR] If you[CR]want to be able to import your Deep Dungeon 1 character into Deep Dungeon[CR]2,[CR] Ive included another tool that will attach your Deep Dungeon 1 FDS[CR]image as a second[CR] disk to Deep Dungeon 2. You can use the tool to remove[CR]the DD1 image after your game[CR] is saved. (note that some emulators will[CR]save and run a backup copy of FDS games in the[CR] save folder. If you import[CR]and save in a DD1+2 image and rename it to your DD2 file and[CR] it appears to[CR]still be a 2-disk (4 side) game, check your emus save folder and delete[CR]the backup)[CR] I did fix one of the games original bugs. The routine to[CR]partially resore an enemys HP[CR] when they eat a vegetable soup was glitched,[CR]and most often would fully restore the[CR] enemys HP. If you want to play the[CR]game as it originally was, Ive included an "Un-fix"[CR] patch. Please patch[CR]this AFTER expanding the files and applying the[CR]translation.[CR]****************[CR]EMULATION ISSUES[CR]****************[CR]Should work in any emulator supporting the FDS (that is, most recent[CR]emulators).[CR] Youll need the FDS BIOS ROM. Dont ask me for it. Itll need to[CR]be named[CR] DISKSYS.ROM, and probably be put in the same folder as your[CR]emulators executable.[CR] Also, for the DD1 save import option, Im not aware[CR]of any emulators that allow[CR] you to swap in DD1 without rebooting the[CR]emulated console. In fact, I know at[CR] least one version of FCUEX where[CR]trying will seem to turn your DD2 image into DD1.[CR] (check your emulators[CR]save folder and delete the backup of DD2)[CR] Youll have to use the included[CR]tools to temporarily turn your DD2 game into a[CR] 2-disk/4-sided game, with[CR]your copy of DD1 with your save file attached as a second[CR]disk.[CR]*****************[CR]PLAY INSTRUCTIONS[CR]*****************[CR] At[CR]the start of the game, you are presented with some options:[CR] Begin game -[CR]start from a saved file.[CR] Register name - start a new save file.[CR] Erase[CR]name - delete a save file[CR] Hero of the Heretic War - import a save from[CR]Deep Dungeon 1.[CR] You will need to use the enclose utility to attach DD1 as[CR]a second disk.[CR] See emulation issues.[CR] CONTROLS:[CR] D-pad: Move[CR]cursor[CR] Left/Right - turn[CR] Up - move forward.[CR] Start: Open save[CR]menu.[CR] B Button: Switch between menu and movement mode, and to cancel[CR]options.[CR] A Button: Open doors and confirm menu options.[CR] Your goal is[CR]to manuver through the 3D dungeon to access the next floor,[CR] until you[CR]reach the end of the game.[CR] The world consists of tower leading upwards, as[CR]well as a basement[CR] down into the ground.[CR] Services in the town of[CR]Dorl:[CR] Temple - You can recover your HP (for a price determined by the[CR]amount of HP you have lost), or you can pray.[CR] Marketplace - You can buy or[CR]sell tools or equipment.[CR] View Items - View your items.[CR] Castle - Enter[CR]the dungeon.[CR] Inside the dungeon:[CR] Status indicators:[CR] Level - your[CR]experience level. Higher levels I think affect the probability[CR] of spells[CR]working and such. Also, enemies will run away at higher levels.[CR] HP - Hit[CR]points. You die when its 0. Recover at an inn or by eating Bread. You[CR] can[CR]increase the limit by gaining experience levels.[CR] EX - Experience points.[CR]Get these by beating enemies. When it reaches certain[CR] predetermined (never[CR]revealed) amounts, your Level will go up, along with[CR] maximum HP, and maybe[CR]AP or AC.[CR] And you have various actions you can take.[CR] Fight - attack an[CR]enemy in combat, or hit a friendly person, if youre evil.[CR] Items - use an[CR]item.[CR] Escape - run away from an enemy... maybe.[CR] Search - search the[CR]ground for hidden items.[CR] Speak - talk to friendly people. Useless for[CR]enemies.[CR] View Status - In addtion to your HP, EXP, Level, you can view max[CR]HP and your[CR] other stats:[CR] AP - Attack power.

    <plot>This here is a first-person RPG. Most first-person RPGs suck, at least to me[CR](I always die really easily and get lost frequently), but Deep Dungeon 4 isn't[CR]so bad.

Well to tell the truth[CR]im not too sure myself.[CR]I believe there were 4 in the Deep Dungeon Series each developed by[CR]Square,Asmik and Hummingbird Soft I think. It is a 3D RPG like Wizardy and[CR]Arcana for the SNES.[CR]Why did I choose to translate this in the first[CR]place?... To be honest I dont know. It really[CR]wasnt my decision. I had[CR]gotten Dragon Quest VI for Christmas in 97 and it inspired me to[CR]learn[CR]about romhacking. So I talked to my buddy BigWierd and got some docs[CR]and some info and read up on[CR]it. A day or so later I popped into a channel[CR]on Austnet to chat with some buddies, Aerisu and[CR]Butz had started learning[CR]about romhacking too and had started working on some game I had never[CR]heard[CR]of. Deep Dungeon IV, so we founded Off Course Translations, which was doomed[CR]from the start.[CR]Pretty soon, we figured out that Butz was butchering the[CR]script, making up quite a bit of it.[CR]And soon Aerisu quit romhacking[CR]altogether so I was the lone romhacker on this project, and I left.[CR]I[CR]started chattinig on #romhack when it was fruity fresh and[CR]Ghaleon-X,survive,and Animefx helped me start[CR]reviving the project. We got[CR]a little bit farther and I released a small patch as a #Romhack[CR]translation.[CR]But soon we lost contact with each other and again the Deep[CR]Dungeon IV project was forgotten. Finally[CR]in December of 98, Kueller[CR]decided to help me revive Deep Dungeon IV one last time. So we got to work on[CR]it[CR](Though I must admit he did a lot of it) and we got a translator named[CR]Hunny and later Demi finished[CR]the rest of the scripts up. So here it is,[CR]finally completed... Deep Dungeon IV. Maybe someday we can[CR]tackle the other[CR]3 but I doubt it =) The translation was an easy one from the beginning, it[CR]just lacked[CR]dedicated team members. So Im very thankful for kueller for[CR]keeping up his hard work on this project.[CR]Im glad I could finally see it be[CR]completed... Now quit reading this and go play it =)[CR]WeirdMan [CR]Leader of[CR]Off Course Translations[CR]Well, here we are, at the beginning of the long and[CR]hopefully prosperous road of Dragoon-X Translations.[CR]I have a lot planned[CR]for the group, once Dragon Quest 5 is complete (remaining optimistic), and I[CR]hope to continue[CR]bringing smaller games such as Deep Dungeon IV to the[CR]translation scene. As far as DD4 was concerned, it was a relatively[CR]easy[CR]hack. A lot of control codes made it bitchy at first, but once we got through[CR]that, it was a piece of cake.[CR]I do plan on doing the other Deep Dungeon[CR]games. I have been unable to locate the Deep Dungeon II ROM, so[CR]thats out[CR]of the question for now. Deep Dungeon I is for Famicom Disk System, which from[CR]what Ive been told,[CR]is just as easy as NES. Enjoy this translation of Deep[CR]Dungeon IV by Dragoon-X, and I hope to be writing another[CR]one of these[CR]soon.[CR]Kueller[CR]Founder of Dragoon-X[CR]Translations[CR]----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Version[CR]Information[CR]V1.0 - Battle system display bug fixed, for the most part.[CR]- Complete monster name translation.[CR] - Untranslated bits and pieces of[CR]text blocks translated.[CR] - Enjoy the complete translation![CR]V0.90b - For[CR]the most part, everything is translated. Dialogue is complete, as is[CR]items.[CR] - Display problem with battle system. Names of monsters and spells[CR]will not show up in battle box.[CR] - Untranslated bits and pieces of[CR]different text blocks. I think a bit of shop dialogue is left, monsters[CR]untranslated, as is special intro.[CR] - Names may not be correct in all[CR]places. Weve had about 7 or 8 translators do bits and pieces of script for us,[CR]and they may have translated names differently than others.[CR]Whats Planned?[CR](Assuming I ever want to continue work on future versions)[CR] - Insertation[CR]of DTE.[CR]----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Special[CR]Thanks and Greetings to -[CR]Ghaleon-X - For the Title Screen Work[CR]BigWierd[CR]- Hey bud!

    <plot>You may have heard of Go Nagai if you're into giant robots. He created[CR]Mazinger Z. Here's Devilman, another creation by Go Nagai. Devilman isn't a[CR]giant robot, rather a giant... demon. But he's a good demon, more or less- he[CR]fights other demons for the good of mankind! Well, in this NES game, you get[CR]to play as Devilman! Actually, you start off playing as his alterego, Akira[CR]Fudo. As Akira you really can't kill anything (in the streets, you pretty much[CR]face off against blue gangsters). You first have to find a certain person, who[CR]then tells you what you must do to become Devilman. After that, the game gets[CR]slightly more interesting. Now, you can kill the demons that are running[CR]rampant across the streets, although that won't do you much good if you don't[CR]go around collecting information. After some talking, you can end up playing[CR]as Miki, Akira's girlfriend. And that's pretty much up to where I got. The[CR]game seems to be more of a detective game in the sense that to get anywhere,[CR]you really do need to talk to people and give them the right answer[CR](sometimes, the right answer is kinda... weird- like having to answer that,[CR]no, you did not watch TV yet). From where I played, it seems the game is more[CR]focused on information collecting rather than fighting enemies. In the streets[CR]there's only one type of enemy. That may change in the later levels, though.[CR]Fighting itself is kind of awkward. Not too awkward if you're Devilman, but if[CR]you're someone like Akira or Miki, enemies pretty much just fall back and run[CR]right back at you. You pretty much have no way of getting anywhere unless you[CR]jump over them (although I did fight one mini-boss as Miki and beat him up).[CR]You might need to savestate if you want to get to the ending, unless you like[CR]noting down passwords. Also, if you die, the game will let you continue from[CR]there automatically (you have select continue first, though). The game seems[CR]pretty fun. Snark's translation is kind of pre-90's in a way. Think something[CR]along the lines of the old Final Fantasy minus any apostrophes. Still, the[CR]game itself is pretty enjoyable. To end this, it might be useful to know some[CR]controls: * A - Jump * B - Punch (or in Miki's case, slap) * Start - Pause.[CR]Here, you can select talk if someone's in the same room you're at, or you can[CR]view the password * Select - Once you've transformed into Devilman once, you[CR]can transform back and fro at will by selecting either up (Devilman) or down[CR](Akira) in this menu. Later on, after you're done with Miki, you seem to need[CR]to punch demons out as Akira to build more anger so Devilman can fly to the[CR]next area. Usually, characters will be terrified of Devilman and would much[CR]rather talk to Akira. Still, it's fun to see their wailing screams as Devilman[CR]tries to talk to them. Edit: After having played a little further from the[CR]time this review was written, I have determined that there is a greater action[CR]focus later into the game. I was actually unable to get any further because I[CR]suck at fighting in this game.[CR]Read Me:[CR]Devilman translation patch[CR]c. 2009 snark. [CR]Go Nagais Debiruman/ Devilman series.

Outside are a few[CR]thugs, that you will need to dodge. [CR]Inside the Ms. Makimura will greet[CR]you. Leave and go next door, and a man will tell you [CR]that your girlfriend[CR]Miki is waiting. Talk to Ms. Makimura, and Mr. Makimura who will ask if you[CR]saw[CR]the TV program. Say no, and find out that the city has been attacked by[CR]demons! Go to Mikis room, [CR]and she will let you know that a strange fellow,[CR]Riyo Asuka wants to talk to you. Go outside and [CR]dodge the demons! Walk to[CR]the house with the red fence and meet Riyo, the odd fellow with blonde hair[CR]and a trenchcoat. Riyos recounts the sad strange tale of his late father[CR]who headed a special secret[CR]research unit for the investigation of demons.[CR]Akiras mother and father were members of this group, [CR]who trekked in search[CR]of demons in the Himalayas.Mr and Mrs Fudo die by the hands of demons, and Mr[CR]Asuka dies horrifically in his lab. Riyo swears revenge and asks you if[CR]you believe in your abilities, [CR]which you do of course. Riyo bids you to[CR]increase your anger and become Devilman, even at the expense of your human[CR]heart. Riyo opens the gates of hell, and now you must battle shapeshifting[CR]LADY DEMONS! Punch the ladies before they can transform into jumping green[CR]demons, and eventually a mask will appear. Snatch the mask and become[CR]Devilman! Hit them with your angry fireballs until they are no more. Your[CR]friend Riyo has mysteriously vanished.At this point you can waltz about town[CR]frightening the locals, or transform back into AKira, so they will no longer[CR]shriek in your presence. A townie lets you know that the secret unit went to[CR]the Makimuras. Check the house to find only sobbing Miki is left, apparently[CR]the Secret Unit came in search of demonic activity, and have taken the[CR]Makimuras away. Miki will heal you from this point, should you have any battle[CR]scars. [CR] [CR]Talk to the townspeople, who let you know that there is are[CR]secret ruins hidden underground, that girls should not walk outside[CR]unescorted, and that rogues can have good hearts and can be good allies. You[CR]can fight to build up ANGER points for Devilman to use as fireballs, and to[CR]increase life-bars. When you return to Miki, she will ask you to permit her to[CR]fight outside. "Miki can do it! ", she says as she packs a mean wallop.[CR]Miki can defeat enemies in two slaps! When she enters Riyos abandoned[CR]house, Dosoroku is waiting for her! [CR]Run or defeat him in a few slaps! Have[CR]Miki run as fast a she can back to her room, and report the news to Akira![CR]Miki will now wait at home, and Akira should now head back to Riyos. Masa,[CR]another rogue is waiting there, and hes not talking. Punch him around a few[CR]times, and he will tell you a few things. He knows you have Devil power,that a[CR]secret lab is hidden in the woods and that you can increase Devilmans power by[CR]soaring into the sky![CR] [CR]Transform into Giant Devilman by transforming to[CR]Devilman, and transforming up again! Now you are as big as Godzilla and can[CR]stomp around Tokyo! Press up and you can fly! Avoid the Green and the Brown[CR]demons, walk to the right, into a grasy area until you see a sparkling shining[CR]ring. Enter the ring to face the first Boss Sirene! Sirene will chastize Amon,[CR]the demon Akira combined with. Apprently she loved Amon the bravest of all[CR]demons, and now swears to destroy him for his unforgivable deed. [CR]BOSS[CR]SIRENE is half bird, half demon, with a nasty flying claw. Defeat her as[CR]Devilman with full anger to do the most damage. When you defeat her, Aguwel,[CR]the messenger of demons, dispatches her ally! Loyal Kaimu, an ancient[CR]dinosaur-demon, runs to her rescue. Sirene is mortified as Kaimu rips off his[CR]head in sacrifice so that Sirene can combine with his body.[CR]SIRENE/KAIMU[CR]With a Dinosaur body and a Sirene hood ornament, this[CR]deadly combination will charge at Devilman. Punch away [CR]until this[CR]loathsome duo is history! Take the second mask, level up, youve earned it![CR]Transform into Devilman into Akira, and enter the forest. Dodge the[CR]carnivorous plants, and enter the black hole between [CR]the trees for the[CR]secret entrance to the next level. [CR]2. Underground Lava Caves [CR]Fall down[CR]and go to the right and talk to a human that has fled into the caves to escape[CR]the demons. The monk that you will speak to below will recognize that you are[CR]no ordinary human if you are Devilman, and will also fill up your life-bar. If[CR]you are Akira, he lets you know that a man of strength can tear down[CR]walls....hmmmm. [CR]If the music changes into the emergency theme, then you[CR]will notice that a demon has trappped a human in its claws! This stage is[CR]important because it will affect your rank![CR]Rescue the human? If you select[CR]yes the human will run for it and the demon will run after you! Defeat it in[CR]two hits, and your rank will go up![CR]If you select no the human will explode[CR]in the devils claws, and the demon will run away taunting you![CR]****Notes on[CR]Devilman Rank:******[CR]Rank is displayed when you select the password[CR]function. The ranks are in increments of one; 16 possible statuses. Rank can[CR]increase by defeating bosses or by saving humans. There are four human faces[CR]on the top right hand screen, which are indicators of saved humans. Keep them[CR]from turning into skulls by saving them! If status drops below the sixteenth,[CR]the game will be over. Your rank will increase if you defeat bosses and rescue[CR]captured humans. Your rank will decrease if you decline to rescue the captured[CR]humans, and the last remaining human face is a skull. [CR]In the caves that[CR]appear to be empty, use the talk function to listen to some spooky scary[CR]voices such as [CR]"I am Aguwel Messenger of Hell... Closer devilman" or[CR]"Devilman....whoooo....we are your enemies". In one of the caves there is a[CR]purple demon! Bash it and it will taunt you..."Youre losing your human heart[CR]Devilman!"[CR]Now its time to do some serious spelunking, from the monk go[CR]back up and to the left to the rocky ledges. [CR]Avoid falling in hot lava,[CR]falling stalactites, shrouded wall-walkers, burrowing shell-monsters, and[CR]deadly carnivorous pears throughout this place! Go right to the false walls,[CR]go up and right, then fall down, [CR]go left over lava pits, and fall again.[CR]Go to the left and over the lava, destroy another rock wall to find the second[CR]sparkling ring![CR]Boss:[CR]AGUWEL[CR]This creepy green tentacled beast is the[CR]Messenger of Hell, and he tells Devilman to rot in it! Squiggly Aguwel can[CR]split in two and throw rocks at you, so fire away with angry firepower! Defeat[CR]half of him, and replenish your life, and then finish him off for the second[CR]mask! Go through the door outside and see whats left of Tokyo![CR]3. Tokyo[CR]Ruins[CR]From the building, go left, and enter the maroon building to find[CR]that old rogue Dosuroku and his shiv.[CR]Since he has learned his lesson, he[CR]will give you the option of finding the Makimuras, or staying behind.[CR]As[CR]Dosuroku, go into the large building and go down into the Secret Unit[CR]Complex/Interrogation Facility. [CR]Smash the purple demons, and jump over the[CR]shooting guards in biohazard suits, and time your movements to avoid the laser[CR]beams. Go down and to the right, smash the wall, go up and enter the room that[CR]only Dosuroku can enter. The guard tells you to get lost that only demons are[CR]incarcerated here. Leave, go down and right, and destroy another wall. Dodge[CR]the lasers, go up and enter the cell. Talk to the pig-faced humanoid demon,[CR]and smack him when he gets too tight-lipped. "Whatcha gonna do, torture me?"[CR]he says. Hes hiding something. Eventually he will dish some info about the[CR]Makimuras and a key. Leave, go down, right, and break another wall, and enter[CR]the cell. This demonic humanoid has some pretty scary teeth, and he tells you[CR]that he likes to eat humans and wear their skin! Smack this creature around a[CR]bit for more information, a key, and a blubbering apology. Leave this place[CR]and return outside to Akira, handing over the key. Enter the Secret Unit, go[CR]down twice and to the right, smashing past the breakable walls, and dash[CR]across the lasers, and fall in the deep chamber, go ahead and fall down again,[CR]and enter the cell. Its Mrs Makimura! Destroy the demon and rescue her! The[CR]Mrs. tells you the location of her husband which is at the rightmost upper[CR]cell with a breakable wall. Go this way and rescue Mr Makimura, who will tell[CR]you to meet Dr Yamanobe, who was Dr. Fudo assistant, in the forest! Leave, go[CR]left, down, left, and down again, right and avoid the orange rolling armored[CR]balls, and smack the green serpents for Anger points. Break through the wall[CR]and find the sparkling ring and enter it for a really creepy boss fight![CR]BOSS - JINMEN[CR]This Turtle-like demon has a creepy carapace full of[CR]human faces, and the souls of those he devoured. [CR]"Akira...." "Mother?"[CR]Jinmen laughs and cruelly taunts you with the voice of Akiras mother. Use[CR]fireballs to hit him in the face, and avoid his flying zig-zag flame attack![CR]Destroy this monster and earn your third mask! Exit to the forest for the next[CR]stage. [CR]4. Secret Lab - Go through the woods through the trees to find the[CR]laboratory of Dr Yamanobe, AKiras fathers old assistant. (This is only if you[CR]have rescued both Makimuras). He tells you of your father. Change into[CR]Devilman and he clues you in on his own covert demon research and dissections.[CR]Unfortunately his girlfriend/ assistant Masami Izumi, the telepath has gone[CR]missing and he asks to take over and find her. As Dr Yamanobe, leave and enter[CR]the Demon Research Lab of the Secret Unit. Go right, down, and left and enter[CR]the door. The worker tells you that the Laser Controkl Room is nearby.Leave[CR]and go right, down, and enter the door. The worker let you knows that Masami[CR]was last seen with Dr. Rainuma! Leave, go up on the ledge, up the stairs and[CR]enter the door. Talk to Yamanobes old partner Rainuma who says he is disgusted[CR]with humanity, and now sides with demons! Uh-oh! Slap him for his insolence[CR]and listen to him spill the beans. She is held in the right room, and the door[CR]is equipped with an electric shield! Slap him again for good measure and[CR]return to Akira. [CR]Enter the Secret Lab as Akira, and head right, and enter[CR]the rooms of the encapsulated green girl demons. [CR]THey recognize you now as[CR]a friend! The last of these rooms has a glass capsule, smash it to release[CR]another green demon-girl! She will graciously fill up your life-bars. Leave go[CR]right, and as Devilman jump over the high wall. Go right and enter the door,[CR]go past the lasers and smash the glass capsule to release Masami![CR]She[CR]thanks you and tells you that the door to icy demon world is guarded by[CR]Geruma, demon of the deep waters![CR]Leave, go left, through the wall, enter[CR]the door, smash the round device. Now the lasers are toast! Go out, [CR]left[CR]as Devilman jump over the wall, down, right, jump over the deep pit, and[CR]destroy the wall. Enter the next sparkly ring for the next enemy boss! Note:[CR]if you return to Dr Yamanobes, Masami will be there, and reminds you to visit[CR]before the Ice World. [CR]Boss- DAMASUKU[CR]This boss vows to roll Devilman in[CR]the name of Zenon, and roll he does! Smash him with fireballs, and as he[CR]splits in two, if you defeat one of him your life will restore to the highest[CR]level. Smash him again, and take your next mask! Exit the door into a[CR]subterranean ocean.[CR]5. Subterranean Ocean:[CR]Devilman alone can navigate[CR]this level. Avoid goofy crabs, scallops, prattling prawns, and ferocious[CR]fish[CR]and make sure to have plenty of Anger points here. Press up and[CR]directional keys to swim about this strange sea-world. Go right, down, and[CR]right and up again. Go left, up, right up left up, and swim along until you[CR]demolish the wall. Enter the sparky ring for the next boss![CR]BOSS -[CR]GERUMA[CR]Geruma begins telling you of his new Master, Satan. This huge[CR]fearsome fish-demon hits hard and fast, so fire away with fireballs until he[CR]is fried. As he gurgles his last, He warns you of his spawny minions attacking[CR]your girlfriend, and that his master Satan awaits! Devilman can take the mask[CR]at this point and the Ice Demon World is through the door! [CR]A. Return to[CR]Yamanobes lab and talk to Masami there about Geruma first. She tells you that[CR]not only Zenon has unleashed the demons, but another rising angel as well.[CR]Satan! It gets worse, Riyo Asuka is Satan! Now Akira fears for Miki. Leave,[CR]return to the water world, and go up-up and to the left to enter the secret[CR]hideaway route for the Tokyo Ruins. Enter the building and find Masa Bokuto[CR]with his trusty club. Talk to him and [CR]ask him to save Miki. As Masa you[CR]will be transported to Mikis pink bedroom, and she will scream in surprise.[CR]Talk to her, and let her know you are there to help. Leave, and start[CR]whacking demons with your bat/club. [CR]These mini demons are Gerumas newly[CR]hatched hell-spawn! After beating enough of them, Akira returns and[CR]vows[CR]that he will keep Miki safe from demons. Now its time to beat the demons on[CR]their own turf! [CR]6. Ice World of Demons:[CR]Go right in this slippery ice[CR]world. If you have two fireballs throw them now, otherwise confront the[CR]Psycho Genie! "Ho Ho Pycho Genie blasts you with mind power!" Hit before[CR]the genie disappears and repeat until it is gone. If you survive, you get full[CR]life! go right and through the door to enter the deadly Ice Palace![CR]Avoid[CR]falling ice-cicles, rolling ice-crab demons, slithering flying snakes, and[CR]watch your step! There are [CR]only two friendly green-demons here to fill[CR]your life bar, one to the bottom left door and one to the top left door. Go[CR]right up, left up, left up, to the topmost left ledge. (YOu can go through the[CR]door and fill up, avoiding the swarming bat-demons. Go right and up through[CR]the door. Go right, and confront an ugly brown demon! This demon says that he[CR]is Satans minion and he is ordered to destroy Devilman! Fireballs finish this[CR]guy off fast. Enjoy your life-fill and go right and through the door to face[CR]the Archdemon Zenon![CR]BOSS ZENON[CR]Hes huge and has four faces and a nasty[CR]claw! Zenon boasts that he is the Lord of All demons and that Devilman will be[CR]history! Move quickly to the spot before the second post, dodge his fireballs,[CR]and time your jump to smash his middle face! Avoid his clutching grasp and[CR]knock him until he is no more![CR]*****ENDING**** Four alternative[CR]endings.[CR]Devilman game ending info: [CR]The endings are as follows and[CR]dependent on events that occur during/after the Tokyo Ruins stage:[CR]1. If[CR]you rescue Mr. and Mrs. Makimura, Ms. Izumi, and Miki, you have the option of[CR]defeating Satan after Xenon. If you defeat him the ending will be the best[CR]ending with credits and pcitures of all the nice people that you saved. [CR]2.[CR]If you rescue Mr. and Mrs. Makimura, Ms. Izumi, and Miki, you have the option[CR]of defeating Satan after Xenon. If you do not defeat him the ending will be[CR]pretty gruesome. [CR]3. If you rescue Mr and Mrs Makimura, Ms. Izumi and but[CR]not Miki, the ending will be different after defeating Xenon, you get to see a[CR]sad message and the little brown devil mask.[CR]4. If you do not rescue Mr and[CR]Mrs Makimura (the options of rescuing Miki and Ms Izumi will not happen) and[CR]the ending will be different after defeating Xenon you get to see another[CR]message and the brown devil mask.[CR] [CR]*****THANKS*********[CR]Thanks for[CR]reading this comprehensive walkthrough and feel free to send your kudos or[CR]feedback. :)[CR]c. 2009 snark</plot>

    <plot>This game is a really bad game, that is only worth mentioning because it[CR]features.. TADA! The Lovely Angels! Maybe I'm too tough on the game (it came[CR]out over fifteen years ago, for God's sake), but it certainly doesn't hold up[CR]well in any case. The first stages are just your running and shooting things[CR]with your pistol stages. Sometimes you can grab a medallion thing and Kei can[CR]come in her little car thing and you can hop in and fly through the stage! And[CR]then you will get to the vaguely Metroid-ish base stage and you will get stuck[CR]and quit playing.

A new twist to old[CR]games, as it were. This is done because[CR]of the childhood memories I have of[CR]playing these great games, and now,[CR]today, reliving the adventures. Only[CR]now it is I who calls the shots. I[CR]hope that you, too, enjoy the products[CR]of Ballzysoft Industries as much as[CR]much as I helped to create and reinvent[CR]them.[CR] I translated this game to show what an icky otaku I can be. I[CR]love[CR]the sci-fi shlock anime that is "Dirty Pair", so getting this game in[CR]full[CR]English was a must on my list. Finding a translator for what[CR]minute[CR]dialogue the game had proved surprisingly difficult. After Chojin[CR]lost a[CR]completed script translation to the CIH virus, I went to maht from[CR]RPGe and[CR]got things finished up. There. It only took 6 months. :/ Shoot,[CR]and[CR]this game isnt even the highest calibur out there... My sweat and[CR]blood[CR]went into this thing, though, so you gotta give me props there, even[CR]if the[CR]game kinda does suck.[CR]_______[CR]III.=============================(CREDITS)==================================[CR]Chris[CR]Collette/Ballz (collettecr@vcu.edu) - project leader; title screen [CR] hack,[CR]text insertion, non-dialogue translation, dialogue touch-up[CR]Matt[CR]Langille/maht (---) - dialogue translation[CR]????/Spinner 8 (---) - text[CR]dump[CR]John Paul Murphy/Chojin (---) - preliminary translation (with[CR] help[CR]from a friend... cant remember his name, so Ill just call[CR] him Hugh G.[CR]Rection.

VERY HARD. I myself[CR]cant get past[CR]stage 2, and I think Ive progressed further than anyone else[CR]ever has. So[CR]the ending dialogue is a bit shaky. maht had some trouble[CR]translating a[CR]bit of it, and I have no way of testing to make sure I didnt[CR]totally[CR]screw up the insertion.

    <plot>Mirai Shinwa Jarvas is an action role playing game for the Nintendo[CR]Entertainment System. You are from the future and your goal is to conquer the[CR]world. In order to do so, you need to gather allies and conquer[CR]castles.[CR]Read Me:[CR]===============Distant Legend of[CR]Jarvas===============[CR]======================V1.00===========================[CR]Genre:[CR]ACT/RPG[CR]Source language: Japanese[CR]Patch language: English[CR]Author:[CR]aishsha/Pennywise[CR]E-mail: aishsha@gmail.com/[CR]Web-site:[CR]aishsha.blogspot.com/http://yojimbo.eludevisibility.org/[CR] [CR]======================================================[CR]Jarvas[CR]======================================================[CR]Background:[CR]For both myself and aishsha this was practically[CR]our first translation[CR]personally and working together.[CR]Originally I had released a slightly[CR]incomplete patch[CR]on Xmas 2008 and there were still issues that[CR]werent[CR]dealt with until 2 years later. It took way longer than[CR]it should[CR]have, but its now done and thats all that matters.[CR]I would like to mention[CR]that I find this game to be on[CR]the very bad side. If anyone is crazy/dumb[CR]enough to[CR]play it, I will try to give them some guidance as to[CR]what to[CR]do. First of all, you do not level up automatically.[CR]You must go to a guild[CR]to get a level up. Finally, the[CR]goal of the game is to gather an army and[CR]conquer all[CR]castles in the world. I would also recommend a heavy[CR]usage[CR]of cheating to speed the game up.[CR]A few bugs and odd stuff to note. The[CR]menu occasionally[CR]flashes brown. Pretty sure this was present in[CR]the[CR]original version. Also attack and defense stats are[CR]not effected by[CR]weapon and armor. This was probably[CR]an oversight and I had originally[CR]altered the stat[CR]routines to add when a new piece of equipment[CR]was[CR]bought, but I removed it. I wasnt sure if[CR]I was adding actual equipment[CR]stats.[CR]Use a patching IPS utility of your choice to apply the[CR]patch (I[CR]do recommend Lunar IPS). [CR]We would be highly grateful, if you find some[CR]time to [CR]contact us with proposals or corrections. Information[CR]on found[CR]bugs or corrections would be highly [CR]appreciated.

    <plot>Doraemon is a video game adaptation of the popular Japanese anime of the same name, developed for the Famicom in 1986 by Hudson Soft. It was the tenth best selling Famicom game released in 1986, selling approximately 1,150,000 copies in its lifetime. It is the third game created for the Doraemon license after the versions created for the Arcadia 2001 and the Epoch Cassette Vision.[CR]In this game, Doraemon must travel through three different "Worlds" in order to rescue his five human friends who have been kidnapped. Each world is actually a different game with its own style of genre and game play system, and was designed by a different lead designer. The first World is an action game that takes place in a city that scrolls continuously in four directions. The second World is a shooter game that scrolls automatically in both horizontal and vertical directions. The third World is an underwater adventure game where each screen scrolls over to the next like in the original Zelda game.</plot>

    <plot>Doraemon is some kind of anime series in Japan. I don't know for sure since[CR]I've never seen/heard of it. And I really don't care either. Here is one of[CR]many games based on Doraemon. Fortunately, you don't need to have heard of it[CR]to play this. At least, I don't think. At first glance, this is just your[CR]typical boring Famicom RPG. And for the most part... well, it is. But there's[CR]a lot of stuff in it that's really neat and makes it pretty fun to play. Some[CR]parts just are so unbelievably badass that they can not be described in a[CR]review such as this. I don't know whether to recommend it or not, since the[CR]cool parts are pretty scarce, but anyway just give it a try. Or not. I think[CR]you should though.[CR]Read Me:[CR]Doraemon RPG Patch v1.0[CR]Hacked by[CR]WakdHacks [CR]-------------------------------------- [CR]WHATS IN v1.0 - 100%[CR]completed|[CR](released October 5th, 1999) |[CR] |[CR]Everything![CR]|[CR]------------------------------------[CR]WHATS IN v0.3 - 35%[CR]completed|[CR](released July 24th, 1999) |[CR] |[CR]All menus |[CR]95%[CR]monsters |[CR]70% items |[CR]25% dialogue |[CR]|[CR]-------------------------------------[CR]WHATS IN v.01 - 5% completed[CR]|[CR](released June 28th, 1999) |[CR] |[CR]Almost all menus |[CR]Some monsters[CR]|[CR]Some dialogue |[CR]Prologue |[CR] |[CR] |[CR]What needs to be done -[CR]|[CR] |[CR]Everything else |[CR]------------------------------------- [CR]How[CR]to use the IPS patch - [CR]Download Snes Tool from the WakdHacks page (URL on[CR]the bottom of the page).

    <plot>Of the extremely little I've played of River City Ransom, I would say that[CR]Technos Samurai is a lot like it. Except Technos Samurai is much more[CR]Japanese, and a whole hell of a lot more confusing. I played the game for a[CR]long time, and not only did I not know what I was doing, I forgot what I was[CR]supposed to have BEEN doing. If that makes sense, anyway. You pretty much just[CR]run around Japan, looking for enemies to fight.. And after you've cleared a[CR]screen of enemies, then you fight the boss of the enemies, who may or may not[CR]tell you something afterwards. But it's fun, and you certainly do fight a lot,[CR]so who's complaining? It's Technos, so have fun and stuff.[CR]Read Me:[CR]Technos Samurai: Downtown Special! v1.0 9/03/98[CR]~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~[CR] [CR] ROM Hacker: Jim[CR]Price Translator: Faraday[CR] Editor: Wildbill Additional Wildbill[CR]Translations: Nick[CR]Whats been done: Text replaced [CR] Pointers[CR]recalculated[CR] Item icons created [CR] A couple of color palettes changed[CR]Whats not done: Nothing, as far as I know.

Just select "Use IPS" and follow the [CR]instructions.[CR]_______________________[CR]Hey! Someone want to make a faq[CR]for this game? Even I didnt manage to find [CR]all of the hidden[CR]shops...[CR]Thank you, again to Faraday for translating the text and to[CR]Wildbill[CR]for the excellent job editing the script and beta testing.[CR]-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]From[CR]the editor:[CR]Greetings Players![CR]First off, I think the entire gaming[CR]world owes Jim Price a word of[CR]gratitude for creating this English patch[CR]for Technos Samurai - Downtown[CR]Special, and making it available to the[CR]whole universe. For pure[CR]Japanese culture afficionados, however, Jims[CR]creation departs from a[CR]perfectly literal translation. To those jaded[CR]individuals out there who[CR]are pedantic in outlook, I would say that someone[CR]so enamored with[CR]Japanese culture should also know the language quite[CR]fluently, and thus,[CR]not need an English patch. Otherwise, anyone[CR]dissatisfied with[CR]this outstanding addition to the English repertoire of[CR]classic games,[CR]should procure the ROM and create a "proper" translation[CR](whatever that[CR]is) with our blessing![CR]That said, I will explain our[CR]rationale for interpreting the funky[CR]spirit and humor in this game. But[CR]before I do, I wish to say that[CR]nothing would have been remotely possible[CR]without Faradays excellent[CR]work, as always, not only in performing the raw[CR]translation, but[CR]enlightening us about the "Old Tokyo" back-street[CR]ambiance" that[CR]characterizes the theme of this game. In Faradays own words,[CR]Downtown[CR]Special is rather "cheesy":[CR] "This game is supposed to be a[CR]comedy. As you know, a lot of (corny[CR] lines) appear while youre actually in[CR]action, while beating the[CR] hell out of your enemy. And they are rather hard[CR]to read to begin[CR] with, but once you get use to it, you will begin to read[CR]all the[CR] text and laugh, while youre kicking your opponents ass. Well,[CR]thats what happens in (J)apa anyway. It was intended to be more of[CR] a[CR]laugh, rather than a serious complete levels, complete the[CR] game.[CR] "I[CR]hope to recreate that, and Ive done my best to adopt the "mood"[CR] rather[CR]than literal translation of the words.... And weve got to[CR] sort out the[CR]names.... They must be read quickly. (J)apa names[CR] arent good for that, if[CR]were going to deal with (E)nglish[CR] speakers.[CR] [Note: We shortened most[CR]of the names...ed.][CR] "And an extra note: I found it VERY difficult to[CR]translate the dump[CR] towards the end. This is because they are mixture of[CR]modern (J)apa,[CR] old (J)apa gag (like Shakespearian wit) and finally a[CR]typical[CR] poetic-style (p)eriod play style text. It all sounds silly and odd[CR]in[CR] (J)apa, but thats the object of the game. So Ive translated the[CR]cheesiness, but changed the actual text i.e. literally very little[CR] is[CR]translated in the last few lines of end sequence."[CR]Thus, Jim and I took the[CR]spirit of Faradays words, and after further[CR]consultations with him (and[CR]with his blessing), we decided to take one[CR]more step in the transcription[CR]and adapt a Western street-gang lingo,[CR]while still trying to preserve the[CR]uniquely Japanese flavor and[CR]backdrops. I know this sounds paradoxical[CR](even to us), but we wanted to[CR]end up with a game that would "play well in[CR]Peoria". Working Designs[CR]takes this approach all the time, so, who are we[CR]to question its[CR]legitimacy? Therefore, we took a little license with the[CR]plot, changing[CR]it from the roundabout, poetic, Japanese method, to the[CR]harder-hitting,[CR]in-your-face, tell-it-like-it-is, right-up-front western[CR]style of action[CR]storytelling.[CR]Our resulting prologue now offers a direct[CR]introduction of the characters[CR]missions, conflicts, and romantic woes,[CR]delivering a clear message that[CR]the heros girl has apparently been stolen[CR]by some asshole whos seems[CR]to be also working for the "Beeg" boss-man. But[CR]first, our intrepid hero[CR]must find an ellusive remedy for his stricken[CR]boss, and while searching[CR]around almost aimlessly in this very non-linear[CR]game, he and his[CR]companion(s) enounter all sorts of zany characters who[CR]either give them[CR]vague information, or engage them in goofy battles[CR]reminiscent of The[CR]Three Stooges.[CR]There is a "Map Cursor" item at a[CR]secret shop in Hizen. I would suggest[CR]that you find it, then warp around[CR]the map and fight those people[CR]wearing the more brightly-colored clothing.[CR]Characters will join you,[CR]abandon you, give you items, and fight you; and[CR]soon, youll have no[CR]idea whos supposed to be doing what to whom! Thats the[CR]way the game[CR]seems to be intended to be. Indeed, it has more twists and[CR]turns than[CR]the Snake River, but its sidesplitting humor overrides all of[CR]the[CR]head-scratching Machiavellian plotting. Just remember that "the[CR]butler[CR]didnt do it", and that the game is intended to be an absolute[CR]frolic[CR]for the Japanese player, sort of like, "Laurel-and-Hardy-meets-[CR]the-[CR]Jesse-James-gang".[CR]I hope you, the public, will enjoy this little[CR]creation. I would place[CR]it right up there with Mario-I, for its period.[CR]Remember, Jim was not[CR]required to share his work. It is both a privilege[CR]and a pleasure to[CR]receive this patch, but not an absolute right. I can[CR]attest to how hard[CR]Jim has worried on it. It shows...so, enjoy![CR]-Wildbill[CR]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Please[CR]direct all bug reports, questions, comments, suggestions etc. to[CR]Tsamurai@hotmail.com</plot>

    <plot>This game is... er, well. You play as the great mighty hero, Carl, who[CR]thankfully doesn't go around with a hairy gut poking out from underneath a[CR]wifebeater. You go from dungeon to dungeon (which have to be entered with the[CR]SELECT button, for some screwy reason), killing monsters with your limited[CR]supply of bouncy arrows and wandering from room to room. When you haven't[CR]visited a room, you won't be able to see it, cuz it'll be dark and stuff, but[CR]when you enter the room, it'll become light! Wowie! That way you can tell[CR]where you've been and where you haven't! The problem is that there's no real[CR]map feature, and since all the rooms look the same it's very, very easy to get[CR]lost, especially when all the rooms have been lit and you're just looking for[CR]the door that goes with that key you got from killing the brontosaurus, or[CR]when you're looking for the room with the big nasty dragon in it so it can[CR]kill you all over again. And then, once you beat the big nasty dragon, you get[CR]a NEW map with a whole slew of NEW dungeons to go through! Yay Carl!

    <plot>The first in the long running series of games, beginning with the Nintendo[CR]Entertainment System and spanning the SNES, the Gameboy, and even the[CR]Playstation, as well as having mini-spinoffs which are a lot like Pokemon.[CR]This, the original Dragon Warrior, starts you off in the throne room of the[CR]King of Tantegal Castle. He names you the descendant of the legendary Erdrick,[CR]who once possesed the Ball of Light. It has been stolen, the Dragonlord's[CR]minions roam the lands, and the Princess is kidnapped. You, the descendant of[CR]the legendary hero, must confront evil and save the continent. This game[CR]features a single-character interface with single-monster battles. Do not[CR]think this means it will be easy...you can easily go in over your head. You[CR]must make sure to buy equipment, as for some odd reason, trained descendants[CR]of heros do not have any starting equipment. This game was once released by[CR]Nintendo along with subscriptions of Nintendo Power magazine, so it is not[CR]extremely rare. However, it is a good place to start learning of the series,[CR]as it began everything. Also, the rest of them are considered hard to find.

    <plot>Yume Koujou: Doki Doki Panic is an action platformer game for the Family[CR]Computer Disk System. This is the game that Super Mario Brothers 2 was based[CR]on. When Nintendo released Super Mario Brothers 2 (The Lost Levels to us[CR]Americans) in Japan, its popularity was eclipsed by this game, which came out[CR]at about the same time. So Nintendo in all their wisdom decided to hack some[CR]Mario characters into it and release it as SMB2 stateside. There are a few[CR]more differences than the character changes. Gameplay wise, this is almost[CR]exactly the same as SMB2, so if you're a fan of that game, or of the Mario[CR]series in general, you should give this one a whirl.[CR]Read[CR]Me:[CR]~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~[CR]Yume Koujou Doki Doki Panic[CR] Doki Doki Panic!![CR] English Translation[CR]Patch[CR] Version 1.0[CR] Created by Vice Translations[CR]http://vice.parodius.com/[CR]~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~[CR]*NOTE*[CR]Please do not distribute the patch file without this documentation, since[CR]it contains important[CR]information.[CR]~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~CONTENTS[CR]~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~[CR]1 - Version History[CR] 2 - Project History[CR] 3 - How To Patch[CR] 4 -[CR]Controller Functions[CR] 5 - What tools did you use on this project?[CR] 6 -[CR]So... what emulators can run this?[CR] 7 - Okay, what did you leave[CR]untouched?[CR] 8 - Anything else you want to tell us, Kitsune?[CR] 9 - And who[CR]were the culprits that ruined this game for us?[CR]10 - To whom do you owe[CR]respect?[CR]11 - And who can go to hell?[CR]12 - Standard Disclaimer[CR]Text[CR]13 - And finally, do give credit where it is due,[CR]please.[CR]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]1[CR]- Version[CR]History:[CR]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Version[CR]1.00 [1425 bytes][CR] Changed the title screen.

    <plot>Eggerland is the first Eggerland game for a Nintendo console and the third game in the series overall, after Eggerland Mystery 1 and 2 for the MSX. Much of the game's resources and levels actually come from Eggerland Mystery 2, though there's a lot of extra elements as well. The series would become better known in the West as Adventures of Lolo.[CR]The game features Prince Lolo and his attempts to rescue his girlfriend Lala from the diabolical King Egger by solving a series of puzzle rooms involving collecting hearts and avoiding enemies.[CR]This game is of the "labyrinth" model of Eggerland games which, unlike the sequential "tower" format evident in the Adventures of Lolo series, provides the player with non-linear branching paths to follow in the form of multiple exits for each stage. Besides that, the usual rules apply: Lolo must find and collect all the heart icons in a given stage and then reach an exit, though it's worth keeping in mind that many of the monsters are completely inert until the last heart icon is collected, at which point they wake up and become very dangerous. As well as ensuring that they are able to reach all the heart icons, the player must also make sure to prepare a safe path to the exit for when the monsters awake.</plot>

A player controls a spherical jewel, and jumps from tile to tile. Stepping on an arrow shifts a row or column in the direction of the arrow. Placing two or more of the same object next to each other will erase them from the board, and must be repeated until all the objects have been eliminated from the board.</plot>

    <plot>The player character is a young electrician called Richard Light. He must install electrical wiring in apartment buildings in various American cities. In each building, Richard navigates service corridors to link the electrical wires between each room, As he does so, animals threaten to chew through the wires. When an electrical connection is complete, the live wires illuminate the connected rooms and electrocute the "enemy" animals on contact. If Richard touches any of the rats, bats, or giant insects in the corridor, he loses a life. In the buildings, the player earns points by illuminating rooms and electrocuting any rats, bats, and insects. Occasionally, a burglar appears; intercepting him rewards the player with bonus points and a bell, which is worth a 1-up.[CR]After wiring all the rooms in an apartment building, the player exits and navigates a dark sewer to the next building. In the sewer, the player must avoid turtles and green slimes. A flashlight reveals hidden walls.</plot>

    <plot>Elysion, though a fairly traditional 8-bit JRPG in many respects (the first thing the player does is talk to the local King for exposition, for example), draws its influences from a lot of very different games within the RPG family: It superficially resembles the first Dragon Quest, it allows the player to select between multiple protagonists when starting the game as is the case in Final Fantasy, the combat system is real-time combat without screen transitions such as something like Hydlide or Ys and the enemies have an odd habit of only moving when the player does, such is the case in many strategic Roguelike dungeon crawlers like the Mystery Dungeon series.[CR]The goal of the game is to defeat the evil demon Baal. However, the King first tests the player character by having them enter the dungeon beneath the castle and find a group of important quest objects. After completing this large dungeon, the protagonist officially becomes the Hero of God and can go defeat Baal by exploring the rest of the continent for some necessary magical scrolls and, eventually, special God-like equipment.[CR]"Elysion" refers to the Elysian Fields, an ancient Roman underworld for honorable souls that died in battle.</plot>

    <plot>Brick Town, a town within a storybook, is in peril! Evil forces have descended upon the land and kidnapped the mayor's daughter. And it just so happens that you have ESP. Thus it descends upon you - and your gun - to save Brick Town.[CR]Unlike most other RPGs of the time, Esper Dream isn't based on medieval times, but rather on a fairy tale storybook of five chapters, each with a setting that is distinct from each other (they also contain sub-dungeons). Battles are started when the player runs into various pairs of moving footprints on the ground. This takes the player to a separate enclosed battlefield. There the player can use their weapons (or ESP powers) to defeat their enemies. Winning battles will increase the player's character's experience points, eventually leveling them up when they reach certain experience point totals. Leveling up increases their Hit Points (HP) and ESP Points (EP). The player can also buy weapons by using the Gold Pieces that defeated enemies leave behind.[CR]The game is over when the player's HP reaches zero - or when the player has successfully saved Brick Town from the evil scourge.[CR]Up to three save slots are available. They allow players the opportunity to save their progress and return to their adventure at a later date.</plot>

Known issues[CR]5.[CR]Application Instructions[CR]---------------------[CR]1.About Esper Dream[CR]2[CR]---------------------[CR]Esper Dream 2 is a fairly simplistic Action/RPG[CR]by Konami. The[CR]game has our protagonist chasing the missing Rings of the[CR]Book[CR]Worlds through a number of novels-come-to-life. Enemies in this[CR]are[CR]symbolized by walking pawprints; should the character come[CR]into contact[CR]with the prints, the scene switches to a battle[CR]arena in which the player,[CR]an ally (if one is present), and the[CR]enemies duke it out in similar fashion[CR]to a Zelda game.[CR]A few (extremely minor) changes were made to accomodate[CR]screen-[CR]space restrictions; since the name variable is four[CR]letters[CR]long, the main characters default name in the Japanese[CR]version[CR]("Mamoru") was changed to "Matt." Similarly, the esper[CR]powers[CR]mostly underwent cosmetic changes:[CR]Esper Beam -&gt; ESP[CR]Beam[CR]Esper Light -&gt; Light[CR]Esper Stop -&gt; ESP Stop[CR]Power Repair -&gt; ESP[CR]Heal[CR]Teleport == Teleport[CR]Flash == Flash[CR]Foe Call == Foe[CR]Call[CR]Esper Barrier -&gt; Barrier[CR]Everything else retained its original[CR]name.[CR]---------------[CR]2.Patch History[CR]---------------[CR]Esper Dream[CR]2 is a game Id wanted to work on for a very long[CR]time, but was not able to[CR]do until recently. A few months ago[CR]I received some initial help from g8z[CR]et al. on shrinking the[CR]16x16 font to an 8x16 font; their hack worked, but[CR]I was still[CR]stuck with the original number of characters onscreen at[CR]the[CR]same time, and there were other routines that needed[CR]changing[CR](although they shared the actual print code with the[CR]main[CR]routine.) When DDS stepped up to the plate to translate, I[CR]fixed[CR]the font stuff, and when he finished the script in a[CR]weeks time, I quickly[CR]got the rest of the game up and running.[CR]As a slightly humorous aside,[CR]shortly after launching the beta,[CR]my testers started to complain that the[CR]first boss was[CR]unbeatable. This couldnt be right, I thought, as Id[CR]already[CR]played through the game in its entirety on my own. Sure[CR]enough,[CR]though, the bosss HP was set to 65535 if its health ever[CR]went[CR]negative. Turns out there was a checksum implemented to[CR]prevent the editing[CR]of the title screen... I removed the check[CR]and it worked fine, but still.[CR]Classic Konami, title checksums.[CR]September 12, 2006 - Initial version 1.0[CR]release.[CR]---------------[CR]3.Patch Credits[CR]---------------[CR]THE ESPER[CR]DREAM 2 TEAM[CR]Main Team:[CR]Gideon Zhi - Project leader, Romhacker,[CR]Translator[CR]DDS - Japanese Translator[CR]g8z et al - Initial font routine[CR]work[CR]Kitsune Sniper - Title screen[CR]--------------[CR]5.Known[CR]Issues[CR]--------------[CR]-There are no known issues!

    <plot>WRC is a series of worldwide rally races, not unlike various other auto races![CR]These involve the drivers driving along roads and highways and such, and the[CR]one with the fastest time is the victor.

    <plot>Players take control of one of two warring nations, Red Star and Blue Moon, as they seek to establish turn-based dominance over each other. After selecting which stage to start the game and setting which, if either, player will be controlled by a person, the Red Star army is given the first turn. The objective in each stage is to either conquer the enemy's headquarters or destroy all remaining enemy units in one turn. During each turn, the player is given a certain amount of funds which can be used to build units in factories, seaports, and airports in their command, as well as cities near their headquarters. Each unit has their own specialty and abilities, with ten land units (including two foot soldier units), four air units, and two sea units. Some units use firepower against the enemy, while others provide support to allies. Only foot soldier units are capable of conquering cities, which are used to repair or refuel damaged units and gain more funds. There are 15 maps available at the start of the game, with two secret ending maps dependent on the player's nation when playing against the computer.</plot>

It had all this neat crap in[CR]it, ,d$b.[CR]$$ like maps of both worlds and hint books and all that Working `[CR]$$[CR]`qb Designs type stuff. qb[CR],d$b. ,d$b.[CR]` $$ I picked up a copy[CR]when I was in Japan. I saw it in this one $$ [CR] qb store one day but it was[CR]like 5000 yen (50 bucks)! So I asked `qb[CR],d$b. Bill Fleming if there was[CR]enough money left over from the ,d$b.[CR]$$ Earthbound Zero fund to help me[CR]out, and there was. So I ` $$[CR]`qb went back and bought it once hed sent me[CR]the money, then once qb[CR],d$b. I was back in the USA I sent it over to[CR]Barkley to get it ,d$b.[CR]` $$ it dumped (a correctly dumped ROM of this game[CR]didnt exist $$ [CR] qb yet at the time) and when everything was done and over[CR]with, `qb[CR],d$b. I got to keep the cartridge. ,d$b.[CR]$$ ` $$[CR]`qb I[CR]immediately started thinking about a translation for it, qb[CR],d$b. cuz it[CR]would be so easy to do but still be pretty cool to ,d$b.[CR]` $$ play. I[CR]contacted yoshi about it, and he was pretty eager $$ [CR] qb to help. We had[CR]this whole thing where we were gonna have a `qb[CR],d$b. new intro, even[CR]better than the one in the FF2j thing. I ,d$b.[CR]$$ made up some prototype[CR]plans for the intro and sent them off ` $$[CR]`qb to him. qb[CR],d$b.[CR],d$b.[CR]` $$ I waited and waited to a sign of progress, but nothing came. $$[CR] qb Eventually I emailed him asking what the fuck was up, and he[CR]`qb[CR],d$b. told me he was giving up console programming because it takes[CR],d$b.[CR]$$ away from the nostalgia for him. I disagreed; the only ` $$[CR]`qb[CR]direction one can go is forward, but I respected his decision qb[CR],d$b. and[CR]realised this translation may never be released. So I ,d$b.[CR]` $$ just went[CR]on to other things. $$ [CR] qb `qb[CR],d$b. Two years later, a guy with some[CR]horrible line of bullshit ,d$b.[CR]$$ (he said his brother had leukemia but he[CR]spelled it all wrong ` $$[CR]`qb and stuff) begged me to just forget all the[CR]fancy smancy intro qb[CR],d$b. stuff and just release the fuckin translation.[CR]So I put about ,d$b.[CR]` $$ an hours worth of work into copy-pasting in hex[CR]workshop and $$ [CR] qb here you are. `qb[CR],d$b. ,d$b.[CR]$$ Theres no[CR]frills to this thing - I dont even have the $$[CR]`qb original Neo Demiforce[CR]intro in the FF2j part.

    <plot>Gall Force: Eternal Story is an action shooter game for the Family Computer[CR]Disk System. The game is a FDS 2D shooter based on the Gall Force Anime. You[CR]the player control a space vessel called the Starleaf to rescue all of the[CR]Solnoid crew that have been captured by the Paranoids.[CR]Read[CR]Me:[CR]===========================================[CR]=========Gall Force -[CR]Eternal Story========[CR]==========V 1.00 translation[CR]patch=========[CR]=============2009 Gil-[CR]Galad================[CR]============2009[CR]Honookatana===============[CR]=======http://gilgalad.arc-[CR]nova.org/=======[CR]===========================================[CR]Game[CR]Details[CR]---------------[CR]Gall Force - Eternal Story is a FDS shooter[CR]based on the Gall Force - Eternal Story [CR]Anime. At first I thought this[CR]game was another RPG before playing it, once I started [CR]playing I found out[CR]this game is an interesting shooter. From what I have read, this [CR]game does[CR]not follow the OSV, so dont expect the game to follow the Anime story exactly.[CR]From what I can tell so far, the objective is to fly the Starleaf through[CR]many levels on [CR]a certain path. Depending on which path that you take, you[CR]can confront large boss [CR]spacecraft at the end of the mission, if you beat[CR]the boss, you rescue one of the girls.[CR]Once you rescue a girl, you get an[CR]additional ability for your ship, the Starleaf. [CR]Update[CR]History[CR]-----------------[CR]Version 1.00 - First release.[CR]Patching[CR]Details[CR]-----------------[CR]1.)Use Lunar IPS to patch the rom. Or your[CR]favorite patching application.[CR]2.)Make sure the disk name is Gall Force -[CR]Eternal Story.fds . The size of the disk [CR]should be 127 KB after being[CR]unzipped.[CR]Emulation Details[CR]------------------[CR]This game is a FDS[CR]disk, make sure that you have a emulator that can run FDS games, [CR]along[CR]with the FDS BIOS image. The game has been tried in most NES/Famicom emulators[CR]after the ASM hacks with success.[CR]Known[CR]Issues[CR]------------------[CR]This game is fully translated and shouldnt[CR]have any issues.

And I shifted a[CR]few[CR] tiles around to make the title fit.[CR] FCEUltra (FCEUXD SP 1.07) and[CR]NEStopia (1.35) are the emulators I[CR]tested.[CR]*********************************************[CR]Whats done:[CR] -[CR]Text translated and inserted.[CR] - Graphics translated and inserted.

(I wont[CR]provide this. You find it.)[CR] - Download Lunar IPS.[CR]http://fusoya.cggames.net[CR] - Download nflate, from either my site, or[CR]romhacking.net. YOU MUST EXPAND THE ROM BEFORE YOU PATCH![CR] - Follow the[CR]prompts. Enter the ROM name and a file name for the expanded ROM. Enter 1 to[CR]expand PRG, 0 to (not) expand CHR.[CR] - Open Lunar IPS. Click Apply patch.[CR]Pick the ROM and the patch.[CR] -If that is too difficult, open Lunar IPS,[CR]then close it. Do this to associate IPS files with Lunar IPS.[CR] -Now just[CR]double-click the IPS file, and double click the[CR]ROM.[CR]*********************************************[CR]How to play:[CR]Press Start at the title screen. Youll go to the password entry screen. Use[CR]Left/Right to choose a letter,[CR] use Up/Down to change the letter, and press[CR]A when finished. If correct, youll return to the level[CR] you left off[CR]at.[CR] In this game, you play as Papa. Your job is to travel through the[CR]various stages to save Mama and Hajime-chan[CR] from the enemies. This game is[CR]almost a puzzle game as much of an action game, as you must work through[CR]the sometimes-frustrating controls to solve each level. Each world in the game[CR]has four levels plus[CR] a boss, which are all fought in minigames.[CR] Here[CR]are Papas actions:[CR] Move Press Left/Right.[CR] Duck Press Down.[CR] Crawl[CR]Hold Down and press Left or Right.[CR] Brake While running, press the opposite[CR]direction to slow Papa down before he hits a wall.[CR] If he hits a wall, he[CR]wont be able to move for a bit, and he takes damage.[CR] Climb ladders Press[CR]Up/Down.[CR] Jump Press A while still or moving.[CR] Climb Press A rapidly[CR]while on the edge of a block to pull him up.[CR] Wall-jump When two walls are[CR]close together, jump towards one side and press A a few times.[CR] Papa will[CR]stretch his body, and you can move him up or down. When he reaches the top, he[CR]will grab[CR] the edge where his hands and head are.[CR] Run While already[CR]holding a direction to move, begin to hold B. (you must press the[CR]directions[CR] first)[CR] Float Press B while standing still to pull out the[CR]umbrella. Papa will fall slowly, but he wont[CR] take damage when he lands. I[CR]think you can only open the umbrella on a jumps ascent.[CR] Pole Vault Very[CR]difficult to do. Im not of the exact sequence, but I believe you need to[CR]first[CR] run (using directions and B) then in the air, release B and A. Tap A[CR]a couple times when[CR] you land for good measure.[CR] Tight-rope walk Just[CR]press B to take out the umbrella, and walk across a rope with the umbrella[CR]open.[CR] Fencing When an enemy Papa can fight appears (most must be simply[CR]avoided), Papa will pull out his[CR] umbrella automatically, in a fencing[CR]position.[CR] Use Left/Right to move, down to duck, A to jump, and B to[CR]stab.[CR] Papa begins the game with three dots, representing health. In later[CR]worlds, he will begin with more.[CR] Papa loses health when he touches[CR]enemies, spikes, lightning, and most other hazards. He will also be damaged by[CR]long falls.[CR] When Papa loses all his health, the game is over. You can[CR]choose to restart the level, or quit.[CR] If you quit, you will be told the[CR]password to replay that level later.[CR] When you step on certain places on[CR]the levels, bonus items will appear.[CR] Coins Worth varying amounts of[CR]points, from 100 to 1000 points.[CR] Rice bowls Eat to extend Papas health[CR]meter by 1 dot. It does not restore any health, though.[CR] It is effective[CR]until a game over, or you finish the world.[CR] Papa can have up to 8 dots. If[CR]you find a rice bowl after that, you will get a coin instead.[CR] Milk Drink[CR]to recovers 3 dots.[CR] Clock Adds 100 ticks to the bonus timer. If time runs[CR]out, you can still play, but you wont[CR] get bonus points when you finish the[CR]level.[CR] If you finish a level with time remaining, you earn 100 points for[CR]every 10 ticks remaining.[CR] If you get enough points (I think its every[CR]10,000. But thats just a guess),[CR] you can be revived one time (when Papa[CR]dies, hell get a free milk bottle, instead of game over).[CR]*******************************************[CR]Heisei Tensai Bakabon[CR](c) 1991 Fuijo-Pro, Kodansha, Studio Pierrot[CR] Game (c) 1991[CR]Namco[CR]English Translation:[CR] (c) 2007 KingMike, odino[CR]No distributing[CR]the patch with ROM, either pre-patched, or in one zip.[CR]Thats wrong.</plot>

The IPS file is to be[CR]applied to ROM[CR]images acquired from somewhere else, and[CR]its up to you to obtain it.[CR]First, you need a copy of the Getsufuuma Densetsu ROM[CR]image, and an IPS[CR]patching program.

    <plot>This is a game in the glorious Technos series of games, in which people beat[CR]the hell out of each other while doing various things. Think Nintendo World[CR]Cup on ice, I guess. Except with a lot more beatings, and variety and stuff.[CR]You're the hockey team at school, and you're playing all the other sports[CR]teams at school. It sounds odd, but who cares - when you beat a team you get[CR]the option of using their uniforms, which also includes the ability to use[CR]their special attacks. It's a hell of a lot of fun, believe you me.

The[CR]goal of the game is to complete a certain number of pipes from the blue liquid[CR]on the right side of the screen to the empty pipes on left. Some stages have[CR]less empty pipes and some have less water pipes from the right. Each level[CR]contains 9 stages. Each stage goes faster than the previous stage until you[CR]finish the level.

Later, all games made for the[CR]NES used[CR]special mapper chips to expand the size of the addressable ROM[CR]beyond these[CR]limitations. This game uses a simple mapper chip to switch[CR]between 4 different[CR]static character ROM banks. One of these banks is used[CR]exclusively for the[CR]graphics on the title screen.[CR]How to patch the ROM[CR]file:[CR]You need:[CR]1) A ROM file. The file needs to include the standard 16[CR]byte iNES header[CR] followed by the program ROM. With header, the ROM file is[CR]65552 bytes in[CR] size.[CR] The header should be as follows:[CR] 4E 45 53 1A[CR]02 04 30 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00[CR] Im not telling you how to get the ROM[CR]file, but once you do, call it[CR] Gorby.nes.[CR]3) Patch File:[CR]DvDGorby.IPS[CR]4) An IPS patching program[CR] Remember to patch the file only[CR]after it has been expanded.[CR] Recommended patching program for IBM PC:[CR]Snes-Tool.exe by The M.C.A./Elite[CR] Recommended patching program for[CR]Mac:[CR] UIPS[CR] Using SNES Tool:[CR] a) If you havent already, make a copy[CR]of the un-patched ROM.[CR] You always want to keep the un-patched ROM around[CR]for later[CR] revisions of the patch.[CR] b) Place an un-patched but expanded[CR]ROM file[CR] (Ill call it Gorby.nes), DvDGorby.IPS, and[CR] Snes-Tool.exe in[CR]the same directory.[CR] c) Run Snes-Tool.exe[CR] d) Type U for "Use IPS"[CR]e) Press the down arrow key until DVDGORBY.IPS[CR] is highlighted.[CR] f) Hit[CR]Enter.[CR] g) Press the down arrow key until GORBY.NES is highlighted.[CR] h)[CR]Hit Enter.[CR] i) Hit Q to quit.[CR](5)-------------------- Playing the game[CR]on an emulator -----------------------[CR]Almost all emulators can play the[CR]original ROM file.[CR]All emulators that can play the original ROM file can[CR]play the translation.[CR]----------------------------- TRANSLATION DETAILS[CR]-----------------------------[CR](6)------------------ Why DvD chose to[CR]translate THIS game --------------------[CR]I decided to translate this game[CR]because I really like Compiles Dr. Robotniks[CR]Mean Bean Machine on the Sega[CR]Genesis. It is my favorite Tetris clone game.[CR]I later found out that DRMBM[CR]is simply the English release of Puyo Puyo for the[CR]Japanese Sega Megadrive.[CR]Puyo Puyo was originally released for the MSX and[CR]then ported to the[CR]Famicom and a number of other systems. But it was only[CR]released here as Dr.[CR]Robotniks Mean Bean on the Genesis and Kirbys Avalanche[CR]on the SNES, which[CR]are essentially the same game with different graphics and[CR]music.[CR]I[CR]looked up all the Compile releases for the Famicom and noticed this[CR]game[CR]which was never released in the U.S. for any platform! It had a funny[CR]theme so[CR]I thought that I would give it a try.[CR]Hacking the title screen[CR]proved challenging and allowed me to be artistic[CR]with the pipes spelling[CR]Pipeline.[CR](7)---------------- Why YOU should bother playing THIS game[CR]-------------------[CR]Its the puzzle game Compile made before they made Puyo[CR]Puyo, the greatest[CR]Tetris clone of all time![CR]Segas Sonic Team who[CR]purchased the license from Compile still makes sequels[CR]of Puyo Puyo to this[CR]day for all platforms.[CR]Its easy to learn but tough to master![CR]Still,[CR]Gorbys Pipeline is not as fun as Puyo Puyo. It is a well made Tetris[CR]clone[CR]that definitely shares a number of things with Puyo Puyo. It has[CR]two[CR]segment rotate-able tiles and things that drop to help you when you are[CR]doing[CR]poorly. If you generally like Tetris clone games you might really[CR]like this[CR]game.[CR](8)----------------------------- DvDs Comments[CR]-------------------------------[CR]Hacking the title screen was much more[CR]complicated than it looks.[CR]First off, the NES didnt have enough tiles to do[CR]the title screen with just[CR]background graphics, so random areas of the[CR]title have sprites interspersed[CR]with background only graphics. Gorbys,[CR]Pipeline, and the subtitle are all[CR]made with both sprites and background[CR]graphics. Fortunately, I was just able[CR]to fit[CR]the English title in, isnt[CR]that how it always is?[CR]Second, the original ROM actually messed up where it[CR]positioned some of the[CR]sprites. After analyzing the code I am convinced[CR]that this is NOT a problem[CR]with the dump, but a problem with the original[CR]ROM due to the number of places[CR]it needed to be fixed. I decided to (had[CR]to) clean it up before I could go on[CR]with the English title, and so I offer[CR]a screen shot of on my site of what the[CR]original title screen should have[CR]looked like so you can see this for yourself.[CR]The subtitle went through 2[CR]changes...[CR]I was originally going to put "DvD Translations" as the subtitle[CR]as the[CR]subtitle didnt really seem to add to the title to me. But,[CR]this[CR]seemed like it would come off as a little too vain. So, I decided to[CR]hack the[CR]credits screen to put it there, it turned out that once I found[CR]the code, the[CR]credits screen was really easy hack and Im glad I went this[CR]way.[CR]Second, I was going with "Great Strategy" as "Big Military Campaign"[CR]didnt[CR]sound right.[CR]Lastly, harmony7 put me on the right track,[CR]suggesting that the subtitle was[CR]supposed to be taken as a joke, that what[CR]sounded best was "Bit Military[CR]Campaign" meaning that Gorbachevs great plan[CR]was to invade Japan by running[CR]a big oil pipe from Moscow to[CR]Tokyo.[CR](9)---------------------- Project Timeline Highlights[CR]-------------------------[CR]Dec 31 2006 - Original Title Screen Errors[CR]Fixed[CR]Jan 1 2007 - English Title on Title Screen Completed[CR] Credits[CR]Screen Edited[CR]Jan 16 2007 - Subtitle Changed[CR]Jan 22 2007 - Patch[CR]Released[CR]Jan 23 2007 - ReadMe Spell-Checked[CR](10)------------------[CR]Software Used In This Translation ----------------------[CR]* Emulators[CR]PC[CR] - FCE Ultra 0.94 (debugger)[CR] by Bero and xodnizel[CR] - Nesticle[CR](used to isolate sprites from background)[CR]* Tile Editor[CR] [CR] Tile Layer[CR]Pro 1.0[CR] by Kent Hansen[CR]* Disassembler, Table Dumper[CR] Table Dumper[CR]6.12.23[CR] by DvD[CR]* Hex Editors, Script Dumper[CR] - Thingy Version[CR]0.98[CR] by necrosaro[CR]* Disassembled Code And Table Analysis[CR] WordPad[CR](Win XP)[CR] by Microsoft[CR]* Manual Creation[CR] Notepad (Win XP)[CR] by[CR]Microsoft[CR]* IPS Patch File Creator[CR] Snes-Tool Version 1.2[CR] by The[CR]M.C.A./Elite[CR]-------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]987654321098765432109876543210987654321[CR]123456789012345678901234567890123456789</plot>

    <plot>The little kitten Kitty, her kitten friend Mimi and their bear friend Tippy love playing with balloons. One day, Tippy has inflated a whole bunch of balloons when suddenly a strong wind blows. Tippy is blown away! The only way for Kitty and Mimi to find their friend again is to pick some balloons and fly to her rescue.[CR]Hello Kitty World is quite similar to Balloon Kid - a forced side-scrolling platform adventure where you control a character floating around with a balloon in the hand. Kitty (or Mimi) starts out on each level with two balloons, and by pushing the A button, she moves upward before sinking again if the button is not pushed again. When Kitty comes in contact with an enemy, she will just rebound, but she will fall to the ground if both balloons are hit. By pushing the B button, Kitty can also choose to let go in order to walk around like a normal platform character. This is necessary in order to reach power-ups and hidden areas. Since the scrolling is forced, it is easy to go get stuck and pushed off the screen.[CR]Throughout the levels, Tippy has dropped balloons that can be picked up for points. If twenty balloons are picked up in succession, they turn into double balloons worth more points. Enemies come both in the airborne and ground-based varieties, along with some fish that can surprisingly jump out of the water. Some enemies can only fly by holding balloons, and just like in Balloon Fight, these can be disposed of by touching their balloons.</plot>

    <plot>People say that this is a lot like Mappy, but I've never played Mappy. But[CR]Mappy can't be as elite as Hello Kitty. Well anyway, your job is to water all[CR]the pots in the level until a happy lil fruit sprouts. Then you go to the next[CR]level. I know, it sounds terribly complicated. But the charm of all Sanrio[CR]games lies in their complexity. All kidding aside, not only can you water[CR]plants (press Down) but you can smack all the enemies that try to stop you[CR](press B). They're only stunned though, which makes things tricky! In any[CR]case, the game kicks ass. Whether the Sanrio part adds to it or causes it, it[CR]kicks ass. It's a nice simple game to play when you're bored, and you end up[CR]playing for hours. So Play It.[CR]Read Me:[CR] _ _ _____ _ _ ______[CR] |[CR]| | | | ___| | | | | | __ |[CR] | |__| | | |__ | | | | | | | |[CR] | __ | |[CR]__| | | | | | | | |[CR] | | | | | |___ | |___ | |___ | |__| |[CR] |_| |_|[CR]|_____| |_____| |_____| |______|[CR] _ __ _______ _______ _______ _ _ ___[CR]______[CR] | | / / |__ __| |__ __||__ __| | | | | |_ || ____|[CR] | |/ / | | |[CR]| | | | |___| | /_/ | |____[CR] | / | | | | | | |__ __| |____ |[CR] | |\ \ __|[CR]|__ | | | | | | ____| |[CR] |_| \\_\ |_______| |_| |_| |_| |______|[CR]FFFFFFF L OOOOOOO W W EEEEEEE RRRRRR[CR] F L O O W W E R R[CR] F L O O W W W E[CR]R R[CR] FFF L O O W W W EEE RRRRRR[CR] F L O O W W W E R R[CR] F L O O W W W W[CR]E R R[CR] F LLLLLLL OOOOOOO W W EEEEEEE R R[CR] SSSSSSS H H OOOOOOO[CR]PPPPPPP[CR] S H H O O P P[CR] S H H O O P P[CR] SSSSSSS HHHHHHH O O[CR]PPPPPPP[CR] S H H O O P[CR] S H H O O P[CR] SSSSSSS H H OOOOOOO P[CR] Hello[CR]Kitty No Ohanabatake[CR] (Hello Kittys Field of Alpine Flowers)[CR] English to[CR]Japanese[CR] Translation[CR] v. 1.00[CR] [CR]-------------------------------[CR]DEDICATION -------------------------------[CR] [CR] This translation is[CR]dedicated to Ashley since I know how much she loves[CR] cute little furry[CR]things like Hello Kitty. Make sure to send her lots of[CR] shiny happy things[CR]any time you see her on IRC.[CR]--------------------------- TABLE OF CONTENTS[CR]---------------------------[CR] I. Dedication[CR] II.

Closing[CR]------------------------------ INTRODUCTION[CR]-----------------------------[CR] Well, for once its a Sanrio game that isnt a[CR]blatant clone of another[CR] game. There are several similar platformers[CR](Mappy comes to mind) but[CR] none with the queen of kawaii, Hello Kitty. The[CR]goal of the game is to[CR] water all of the flowerpots until the flowers[CR]bloom. While attempting[CR] this, you have to avoid squirrels, snails and[CR]beach balls. In a sadistic[CR] twist, Hello Kitty has a big mallet she can use[CR]to squish those pesky[CR] critters. Make sure to stand still for a few moments[CR]to see the[CR] subliminal anti-video game animation. And I always thought[CR]Sonic the[CR] Hedgehog was the first character to do something when he got[CR]bored.[CR] Guess that just proves that Kitty-chan is ahead of her time.[CR] A[CR]note on the title translation. The literal translation of the title[CR] is[CR]Hello Kittys Field of Alpine Flowers. Thats hard enough to say,[CR] let alone[CR]try to hack into a game, so we decided to take liberties and[CR] shorten it a[CR]big. Hello Kittys Flower Garden was the obvious choice[CR] and the words[CR]KITTYs GARDEN appear twice in the ROM if you look at it[CR] in a hex editor[CR]with no table loaded. However, since the action takes[CR] place inside instead[CR]of in an outdoors setting, I decided to go with[CR] Hello Kittys Flower[CR]Shop.[CR]-------------------------------- HISTORY[CR]--------------------------------[CR] v. 1.00 - August 27, 2000[CR] Whats[CR]Complete[CR] - all text translated (I believe.)[CR] - minor graphics hacks[CR](Title Screen and Level Graphic)[CR] Whats Incomplete[CR] - nothing that Im[CR]aware of[CR] - there are some Japanese characters in the ROM I didnt find in-[CR]game[CR]--------------------------------- STAFF[CR]---------------------------------[CR] Hacking - InVerse -[CR]http://www.pigtails.net/ST[CR] Translating - Musashi -[CR]http://gaijin.romhacking.com[CR] I basically did this project just so we could[CR]add it to the list of[CR] fully translated Sanrio games. It was perfectly[CR]playable without the[CR] translation but I figured I might as well do it[CR]anywayz. I believe this[CR] is the first game to be hacked entirely while[CR]sitting on the toilet.[CR]--------------------------------- TOOLS[CR]---------------------------------[CR] The following tools were used for this[CR]translation:[CR] Hexposure: hex editing for translation and graphic[CR]maneuvering[CR] Tile Layer: graphics hacking[CR] Nesticle: some graphic[CR]hacking[CR] SNES Tool: patch creation[CR] [CR]--------------------------[CR]PATCHING INSTRUCTIONS ------------------------[CR] Patching a ROM is extremely[CR]simple. You need three things. A ROM,[CR] the patch and a patching program. To[CR]patch with IPS, you simply[CR] type "ips  ". So if the name of the ROM was[CR]HKFS.nes you would type "ips HKFS.nes HKFS.ips" and your ROM is now[CR] in[CR]English. Make sure you have all the files in the same directory[CR] if you[CR]have a problem.[CR] To patch a ROM with SNES Tool, simply select USE IPS,[CR]choose[CR] the patch and then choose the ROM to affix the patch to. Its[CR]self[CR] explanatory. If you cant figure it out, the game is probably too[CR]hard for you anywayz.[CR]--------------------------- CONTACT INFORMATION[CR]-------------------------[CR] The official Hello Kittys Flower Shop home page[CR]is currently located[CR] at http://www.pigtails.net/ST[CR] E-Mail addresses[CR]concerning the project can be located on the [CR] official[CR]page.[CR]--------------------------------- CLOSING[CR]-------------------------------[CR] So there you have it. Have fun and[CR]remember. Its just a game.[CR] -InVerse</plot>

This game has you playing as Anpanman (or his[CR]friends Currypanman and Shokupanman) as you try to beat Baikinman to the end[CR]of the board you're playing. There are eight boards in all, and three players[CR]can go at it. It's no Mario Party, and there are only -three- minigames, but[CR]it's fun at least, and not too complicated. Too bad that witch Dokinchan[CR]cheats at Jan-Ken-Pon. Hussy.

    <plot>Jesus: Kyoufu no Bio Monster is an adventure game for the Nintendo[CR]Entertainment System.[CR]Read[CR]Me:[CR]==========================JESUS========================[CR]=============Tale[CR]of the Dreadful Bio-Monster==========[CR]=====================3 Days Later[CR]Edition==============[CR]==========================Rev[CR]2========================[CR]Genre: Visual Novel/Adventure[CR]Source language:[CR]Japanese[CR]Platform: Famicom[CR]Patch language: English[CR]Author:[CR]Pennywise/Niahak[CR]E-mail:[CR]yojimbogarrett@gmail.com[CR]http://yojimbo.eludevisibility.org/[CR]======================================================[CR]About[CR]JESUS[CR]======================================================[CR]Background:[CR]From Trickless Site:[CR]"JESUS is an adventure game first released back in[CR]1987[CR]by Enix (Now Square-Enix). It was released for the PC88,[CR]and was[CR]also available on other home computers such as[CR]the FM7 and MSX2. In 1989[CR]the game was ported to the[CR]extremely popular Famicom (NES) courtesy of[CR]Kings Record[CR]and ChunSoft, with the additional sub-title Kyoufu no[CR]Bio[CR]Monster (trans: Dreadful Bio Monster). None of these versions[CR]were[CR]ever released outside of Japan, but it sometimes gets a[CR]mention on English[CR]gaming forums thanks to its name. The[CR]game is a cult favourite amongst many[CR]Japanese retro gamers,[CR]and if you can look past its name and give it a[CR]chance,[CR]you might be surprised by what this adventure has to offer."[CR]So[CR]obviously this patch is for the Famicom port, which had[CR]been translated[CR]previously by Niahak. While reading up on his[CR]patch, I saw that he had to[CR]cut down his translation[CR]significantly due to space restrictions. For a[CR]text-heavy[CR]game like JESUS, you kinda need as much space you can[CR]get. So[CR]I contacted Niahak, sometime in late 2009 I think, about[CR]doing another[CR]patch and he was down for it and so the project began.[CR]The game script and[CR]pointer storage turned out be pretty simple[CR]with only hiragana/katakana[CR]switches and sequential text[CR]being the only thing of note. Since there was[CR]extra space to[CR]spare in the hard-wired bank I ended up doing my usual[CR]DTE[CR]routine to compress the text which was spread across 3 16KB[CR]banks.[CR]So we worked on the translation on and off for a while[CR]until sometime[CR]around late 2011/early 2012 things started[CR]coming together.[CR]It wasnt[CR]until the script was finished that I realized my[CR]compression routine just[CR]wasnt enough for a full script.[CR]So I expanded the PRG-ROM and hacked the[CR]pointer load routines[CR]to split the text between banks thus giving more us[CR]than 2X the[CR]space for the translation. Since the pointer load[CR]routines[CR]were reused for all 3 banks, I had to write a little extra[CR]code[CR]to determine which bank was being used, but it was[CR]simple enough.[CR]The[CR]final 2 aspects of the hacking was probably the most[CR]difficult/pain in the[CR]ass to implement. The sweet title[CR]screen we have courtesy of sin_batsu[CR]first had to be[CR]recompressed back into the ROM from the decompressed[CR]data.[CR]It didnt use the standard NES compression format of RLE,[CR]but[CR]instead something else that was a bit more complicated.[CR]I was able to[CR]locate the decompression routine, but I left[CR]the reverse-engineering to[CR]rveach and who graciously provided[CR]me with decompression/recompression[CR]tools and all free of charge.[CR]Next time I might not be so lucky or[CR]fortunate.[CR]The last hack was a double line hack for the[CR]option/command.[CR]One of the things I didnt like about the original patch[CR]was[CR]that that text was heavily abbreviated into 1 line in 7 or[CR]less[CR]characters. Getting that text to display as 2 lines was way[CR]harder[CR]than it should have been, but I finally got it to[CR]where I wanted it. I also[CR]wanted to have 8 characters per line[CR]instead of 7, but there wasnt enough[CR]room in the internal RAM[CR]buffer.[CR]Now as for the game itself, I usually[CR]dont go for text[CR]adventures, but this game was kinda unique and not[CR]half[CR]bad. You kinda get the impression that the game is open[CR]in design[CR]based on the choices to pick from, but in reality[CR]it is really quite linear[CR]with very little variation on[CR]what you can actually do. That seems to be a[CR]detracting[CR]point for some, but I find this to be a benefit for the[CR]game.[CR]Having worked on Akira, which oddly enough was translated[CR]by[CR]Niahak, any variation of the main path resulted in game[CR]over thus[CR]making it possible to go in circles. Its possible[CR]to breeze right through[CR]Jesus not having to worry about[CR]making a mistake and starting over again.[CR]You are able[CR]to enjoy the game, its world, its character freely.[CR]Even[CR]though the story and premise is obviously based on some[CR]classic[CR]sources, its still pretty good in its own right[CR]and deserves to be played[CR]and enjoyed.[CR]Continuing on the subject of linearity, I estimate[CR]that[CR]between 10-15% of the text is unused by the game. When[CR]the game was[CR]ported from the various Japanese PC systems,[CR]various sections and content[CR]was removed from the Famicom[CR]port. However, the unused text in the ROM[CR]seems to suggest[CR]that there were going to be more things to do, a different[CR]way[CR]to do things. Basically the game would still be go from[CR]Point A -&gt;[CR]B, but you had more options to get to B.[CR]A few of the more noteworthy[CR]things include on the Nebula[CR]the text suggests that it is possible for FOJY[CR]to run out [CR]of juice while wandering around. Theres also an[CR]alternate[CR]way of detaching the Storehouse by reading instructions. [CR]Also[CR]you could trigger the scene with Helene on the Nebula[CR]without the Bio-[CR]Sensor. On the Corona, FOJY and Hayao make[CR]fun of each of other on several[CR]occasions. I have been unable[CR]to trigger any of these events. [CR]Perhaps[CR]where the game falters most is that occasionally the[CR]text wont match the[CR]situation or option chosen and will be[CR]out place. Never having played the[CR]original versions, I have[CR]to assume this was a problem the port introduced.[CR]The effect[CR]is essentially was sloppy/poor event programming that was[CR]either[CR]caused by a bad programmer or the development was kinda[CR]rushed[CR]making the game unfinished.[CR]If I could compare the Famicom port[CR]with one of the other[CR]versions, I might be interested in restoring the[CR]content if[CR]everythings pretty much the same and I know what is[CR]supposed[CR]to go where. The only catch is a certain someone has to get off[CR]his[CR]lazy butt and starting hacking the game so I can play it in[CR]English:)[CR]The music is also one of the highlights for me and I[CR]enjoyed[CR]quite a bit of it. If it sounds familiar, thats because[CR]the[CR]composer is Koichi Sugiyama, who was a regular for[CR]Enix back in the day and[CR]did the soundtrack for at least[CR]the first Dragon Quest. In fact, they play[CR]the main DQ[CR]theme in the game.[CR]Anyway, a lot of work and time went into[CR]this patch, so[CR]we do hope you enjoy the game. I consider it to be one[CR]of[CR]my best releases and am extremely satisfied with it.[CR]If you want to find[CR]out more about the game I suggest you visit[CR]Trickless[CR]site.[CR]http://pixelmenu.22web.org/[CR]======================================================[CR]Niahaks[CR]Comments[CR]======================================================[CR]It has[CR]been almost seven years since I first saw a copy of JESUS[CR]on a shelf in[CR]Japan, and more than five since I released the[CR]original patch for JESUS.[CR]The first patch was a solo effort, and[CR]it was made by "constructing the[CR]Statue of Liberty by hand",[CR]as Im told. This version is much improved,[CR]thanks to the effort[CR]of Pennywise and others in expanding the ROM, and to[CR]Jason and[CR]Pennywise both for their hard work in making my rough re-[CR]translation[CR]fit for human consumption.[CR]A couple of individuals not[CR]thanked below are responsible for my continuing[CR]interest in JESUS. One[CR]emailed me years ago with a message thanking me for[CR]my work on the initial[CR]patch, as it brought back many memories for them.[CR]Another emailed me more[CR]recently with suggestions for naming shortly before[CR]the re-translation[CR]effort started, which gave us a good starting point on the[CR]names (which[CR]were an aspect that needed fixing in particular).[CR]As a translation project,[CR]JESUS was more straightforward than other games[CR]I have worked with. The[CR]script may be kana-only, but the subject matter was[CR]already familiar[CR](though it had been gathering dust for a few years), and[CR]there are few[CR]places where context is incredibly important. The tone of the[CR]original[CR]script is pretty ordinary anime style as well - with little in the way[CR]of[CR]slang and generally consistent structure. Most jokes come at Hayaos[CR]expense,[CR]so they end up being easily translatable. Only a few lines were[CR]particularly[CR]troublesome, and none of those were particularly important in[CR]any case.[CR]At times I am not sure that JESUS itself is worth the effort we[CR]have put into it.[CR]Its a relatively ordinary sci-fi adventure game with a[CR]touch of horror here and there,[CR]and often imposes a strict ordering of[CR]actions on the players part.[CR]It does, however, occupy an interesting place[CR]in Enix history, and it has a decidedly[CR]80s anime vibe which some players[CR]may find nostalgic. Perhaps the name of the game[CR]itself will also spark[CR]some interest in the game. If some people who hear about JESUS[CR]play and[CR]enjoy this translation, that is enough for[CR]me.[CR]======================================================[CR]Patch[CR]History[CR]======================================================[CR]6/08/2012[CR]3[CR]Days Later Edition - Initial release [CR]7/19/2012[CR]Rev 1 - Minor script[CR]fixes, code hacks and bug fixes[CR]plus a bonus manual[CR]Rev 2 - Fixed some[CR]minor text bugs for a few[CR]commands[CR]======================================================[CR]Game[CR]Tips[CR]======================================================[CR]There are[CR]several secret passwords that let you access[CR]different things.

Their historical role, or why they were included[CR]in the Halley Mission[CR]are both unclear.[CR](kometto), literally Comet, is the original name of the[CR]ship called[CR]the Nebula in this translation. It would not have been[CR]confusing[CR]for Japanese readers, as for Halleys Comet they used the[CR]Japanese[CR]word suisei.[CR](Jiizasu), the space station for which the game is[CR]named,[CR]is consistently rendered in standard casing (Jesus). [CR]It does not[CR]appear to be an acronym of any kind.

    <plot>Just Breed (ziyasutoburido Jasuto Burido?) is a tactical role-playing game published by Enix for the Family Computer. It was released exclusively in Japan in 1992. Although it is somewhat obscure and was overlooked due to its late release, it is notable for its long development and as one of the largest RPGs created for the Family Computer.[CR]The game's story opens in the town of Astholm, which is spiritually protected by a sapphire wielded by the priestess Firis. She is one of six priestesses charged with holding a special gem to have together held an archaic power for several generations. During the town's Sapphire Festival, Firis is kidnapped by the henchman of Ezelkiel, a man bent on collecting the priestesses to revive an ancient evil. The player takes on the role of the nameless Hero who, along with being sworn to protect Astholm, is the lover of Firis. He immediately sets out with his army to rescue the priestess and ends up becoming involved in a much larger-scale predicament involving the world's other priestesses and gems.</plot>

    <plot>Another Sanrio game. And believe it or not, it kicks ass! In this one,[CR]Keroppi's girlfriend Keroleen has been kidnapped (why?), and Keroppi goes off[CR]to save her. Sound familiar? Well, first you have to solve a bunch of puzzles[CR]before you can get there. Still sound familiar? Well it's not, dammit. You're[CR]not restricted to one type of puzzle either.. You have the odd lilypad jump-[CR]around-and-make-the-platforms-change-position game, and the platform game[CR]where they change color, and the underground staircase thing, and the[CR]extremely easy game where you just walk to the exit. It manages to stay[CR]interesting for quite a while, and is very fun to play. So, um, try it[CR]out.[CR]Read Me:[CR]Kerokero Keroppis Big Adventure[CR]--------------------------------[CR]English Translation version[CR]1.00[CR]--------------------------------[CR]from Gaijin Productions (of[CR]CTC)[CR]by Translator/Romhacker Musashi[CR]Version[CR]1.00[CR]------------[CR]-All located game text translated[CR]-Title Screen[CR]Translated[CR]About the Game[CR]--------------[CR]In Keroppis Big Adventure,[CR]Keroleen, Keroppis girlfriend, has been kidnapped and its up to Kerropi to[CR]save her.

I was tired of working on my lengthier[CR]project, Rainbow Silkroad (now 100% translated and out soon), a NES[CR]RPG.[CR]After a few days this fairly simple project was completed. It should[CR]be noted that I did not have a script dump when I translating this game so[CR]there maybe a line or to left untouched. If you run across it please it to me.[CR]I also went through several name changes for Keroleen. At first I translated[CR]it to Kerri, then Kerrin, and then, after doing some intesive research at the[CR]Sanrio website I discovered it to be correctly translated as Keroleen. This[CR]was the last change I made to the game and was left unchecked.

    <plot>This is one helluva a neat platform game. You (yes, YOU) are the great and[CR]mighty Kero Kero Keroppi. You see, one day, all the people of Donut Pond were[CR]playing the game, when from the monsters inside the game took over Donut Pond.[CR]How sad. So Keroppi alleviates everyone's fears and sets out to kick some[CR]monster ass. The game is your standard-issue Nes platformer. You jump around[CR]from platform to platform, and kill various enemies by jumping on them in the[CR]time-honored platform tradition started by Super Mario Bros. You can also kill[CR]stuff by shooting at them. "With what," you ask? Why, with musical notes (and,[CR]if you get enough power ups, with Keroppi's very mighty name). The interesting[CR]thing with this game is that instead of confronting you with a boss that acts[CR]just like all the other enemies in the games (except the bosses take three[CR]jumps to kill instead of one), you are confronted with a boss that challenges[CR]you to one of a variety of mini-games. On top of all that, the graphics are[CR]ruley. (BTW, if you like these games, check out the Wagyan Land games. Exactly[CR]the same thing, except instead of Keroppi, you control a Gon/Godzilla looking[CR]thing).[CR]Read Me:[CR]kero kero keroppis great big adventure 2 - by[CR]toma[CR] [CR]THIS GAME IS EVEN MORE RULEY THAN BEFORE![CR]version 1.0[CR] -[CR]this has been wayyyy too long coming, but its[CR] finally done. anyway, just[CR]to make up for slacking[CR] off I basically revamped the whole thing.[CR]spiffy[CR] new font, spiffy new title, and this time its[CR] all done.[CR]enjoy![CR]version 0.9[CR] - i have the thing pretty much done. the only[CR]parts[CR] still untranslated are the battles with the 4[CR] bosses. reason?

    <plot>This game kicks some major league ass. It's like Bomberman almost, but with[CR]water balloons instead of bombs and Keroppi intead of Bomberman ^^. Oh yeah,[CR]and it isn't quite linear, either. You can like go to different rooms and[CR]stuff if you want to. So that's cool.[CR]Read[CR]Me:[CR]~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~[CR]Keroppi and Keroleens Splash[CR]Bomb[CR]v1.0[CR]~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~[CR]3-28-2000[CR]~~~~~~~~~[CR]Platfom:[CR]NES[CR]~~~~~~~~~~~~[CR]Get the latest version at Suicidal Translations[CR](http://www.pigtails.net/ST)[CR]or my site[CR](http://come.to/sixfeetunder)[CR]Email me at[CR]s1xftunder@hotmail.com[CR]Introduction[CR]~~~~~~~~~~~~[CR]Splash Bomb is a[CR]pretty fun Bomberman-ish game, with a nice free roaming aspect to the levels,[CR]meaning you have to find your way through the levels to get to the boss,[CR]unlike most Bomberman games where each level is primarily one screen. It also[CR]features a very original story line.. little white thingy (who is revealed as[CR]Teruteru Chan in the ending.. probably a normal Sanrio character, but since I[CR]only know the names of maybe three...) is bopping around to *gasp* be[CR]kidnapped! So... being the heroes that Keroppi and Keroleen are, they set off,[CR]armed with water balloons to rescue Teruteru Chan.[CR]It uses passwords at the[CR]end of each level to "save" your progress, but its probably short enough for[CR]most people to finish in one sitting. Plus, in the emu-age, passwords arent[CR]needed since weve got savestates now :)[CR]Splash Bomb wont work in some NES[CR]emulators, including Nesticle. I havent tested all the various emulators, but[CR]it should work perfectly in Loopynes and Biones, and wouldnt doubt it if it[CR]works in a few others as well. It DOESNT work in Nesticle, fwNES, or NESten.[CR]Thats all I can think of off the top of my head, just experiment with your[CR]favorite NES emus and figure it out for yourself.[CR]Two player mode features[CR]simultaneous play, which can work to your advantage in single player mode.[CR]Just map the controls for both players to the same keys and move to a corner[CR]or something so both characters occupy the same space, and then you have extra[CR]bombs from the second character.[CR]Quick[CR]Instructions[CR]~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~[CR]D-Pad: Take a wild guess.[CR]A Button:[CR]Set bomb[CR]B Button: Unused[CR]Start: Pause/Show map[CR]Select: Navigate[CR]menus[CR]How to use it[CR]~~~~~~~~~~~~~[CR]Use ips.exe or Snestool to patch[CR]your Splash Bomb rom with the .ips patch.

    <plot>Basically, here's your typical side-scroller. You have a really cool weapon[CR]which can go in all four directions, and you break bells for nifty power-ups[CR]and stuff. Other than that, well, there's really not much else to say about[CR]the game. Anyway, despite what some people say about Kid Niki 2, it's a pretty[CR]cool game, so give it a try if you're bored or something.[CR]Read[CR]Me:[CR]------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Kid Niki 2: Karakuri Land Patch version 1.2[CR] Written by Derrick Sobodash[CR]Copyright 1998-2004[CR] Released on April 3, 2004[CR]http://www.cinnamonpirate.com/[CR]------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]HISTORY[CR] v1.2:[CR] * Fixed the ending (6 years and nobody tells me its[CR]broken?)[CR] * Added a lower-case font.[CR] v1.1:[CR] * Added ending[CR]translation. Thanks to loiosh for pointing this out and[CR] giving me a save[CR]state.[CR] v1.0:[CR] * Initial[CR]release[CR]------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]INTRODUCTION[CR] Set after rescuing the princess in Kid Niki: Radical Ninja, a[CR]new amusement[CR] park called "Karakuri Land" has opened in Edo. The princess[CR]asks Kid Niki[CR] to take her to the amusement park, but he blows her off[CR]since hes busy[CR] training.[CR] The princess and all the other visitors to[CR]the park disappear, and Kid Niki[CR] sets out to rescue everyone once[CR]again.[CR] The game is actually titled Kaiketsu Yanchamaru 2, but the[CR]Yanchamaru series[CR] was titles Kid Niki in the USA, so I went with that[CR]title instead. This[CR] patch was originally released in March of 1998 and was[CR]my first complete[CR] project.[CR] The actual text translation was done by[CR]Shujin-Rik, SoM2Freak, The_Ned and[CR] Harmony7.[CR] The bulk of the work for[CR]this project was all the graphics that needed to be[CR] translated. There[CR]really wasnt much dialogue.[CR] This is an update to the old translation I[CR]released in 1998. I wanted to[CR] make the patch available again, but I also[CR]wanted to deliver something a bit[CR] better than last time.[CR] First off, I[CR]added a lower case font to the game (using the Master of Orion[CR] font[CR]again). I also took time to play through the whole game again and make[CR]sure nothing got chopped.[CR] Apparantly, the old 1.1 patch which translated[CR]the ending BROKE the ending[CR] text and nobody ever told me! This is fixed[CR]now, so if you never did before,[CR] you can play through the game start to[CR]end without any glitches.[CR] I did not change the title screen because it[CR]would involve changing several[CR] hard coded palettes (theres a load of[CR]different color regions so it would[CR] be very difficult to make something[CR]that looks nice and fits around them),[CR] and I didnt want to risk damaging[CR]the game later on.[CR] So 6 years later, here is the final, 100% complete[CR]version of the[CR]game.[CR]------------------------------------------------------------------------------</plot>

Later, all games made for the[CR]NES[CR]used special mapper chips to expand the size of the addressable ROM[CR]beyond[CR]these limitations. This game uses the first special mapper chip made[CR]by[CR]Konami, VRC1. VRC1 is simply used to switch in different sections of[CR]character[CR]and program ROM as this cartridge has no VRAM.[CR]How to patch[CR]the ROM file:[CR]You need:[CR]1) A ROM file. The file needs to include the[CR]standard 16 byte iNES header[CR] followed by the program ROM. With header, the[CR]ROM file is 262160 bytes in[CR] size.[CR] The header should be as follows:[CR]4E 45 53 1A 08 10 B1 40 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00[CR] Im not telling you how to[CR]get the ROM file, but once you do, call it[CR] KKLives.nes.[CR]3) Patch File:[CR]DvD_KKL.IPS[CR]4) An IPS patching program[CR] Recommended patching program for[CR]IBM PC:[CR] Snes-Tool.exe by The M.C.A./Elite[CR] Recommended patching program[CR]for Mac:[CR] UIPS[CR] Using SNES Tool:[CR] a) If you havent already, make a[CR]copy of the un-patched ROM.[CR] You always want to keep the un-patched ROM[CR]around for later[CR] revisions of the patch.[CR] b) Place an un-patched but[CR]expanded ROM file[CR] (Ill call it KKLives.nes), DvD_KKL.IPS, and[CR] Snes-[CR]Tool.exe in the same directory.[CR] c) Run Snes-Tool.exe[CR] d) Type U for[CR]"Use IPS"[CR] e) Press the down arrow key until DVD_KKL.IPS[CR] is[CR]highlighted.[CR] f) Hit Enter.[CR] g) Press the down arrow key until[CR]KKLIVES.NES is highlighted.[CR] h) Hit Enter.[CR] i) Hit Q to[CR]quit.[CR](5)-------------------- Playing the game on an emulator[CR]-----------------------[CR]All emulators that can play the original ROM file[CR]can play the translation.[CR]No expansion or mapper changes were done and it[CR]uses the very common VRC1.[CR]It will RUN in almost all emulators, but I[CR]recommend FCEUXD SP 1.07 as the most[CR]recently updated version of the FCE[CR]Ultra line. The official versions of[CR]FCE Ultra out there that you can[CR]download, really messed a lot of things up.[CR]-----------------------------[CR]TRANSLATION DETAILS -----------------------------[CR](6)------------------ Why[CR]DvD chose to translate THIS game --------------------[CR]Hmm, why this[CR]game...[CR]Well, the MSX game looked pretty cool, it reminded me of Metal Gear[CR]1 on the[CR]MSX. I was intrigued on why there was no King Kong 1 but that[CR]there were 2[CR]seemingly different King Kong 2[CR]games...[CR](7)---------------- Why YOU should bother playing THIS game[CR]-------------------[CR]For the first time, DvD didnt pass it himself. That[CR]role was filled by[CR]Damiano for this project.[CR]Its just an action game[CR]with lots of warp zones. Not really DvDs cup of tea.[CR]Play it if you[CR]like.[CR](8)------------------------- DvDs Hacking Comments[CR]---------------------------[CR]I originally thought this was just going to be[CR]a title screen hack which I[CR]could do on my own, w/o the services of a[CR]translator. I had actually made a[CR]title screen which said KING KONG 2 and[CR]translated the subtitle differently.[CR]At some point, I realized that the[CR]game was based on an American movie called[CR]King Kong Lives and that I[CR]needed to redo the title screen anyway, so I asked[CR]harmony7s opinion on the[CR]subtitle. We compromised on the current subtitle.[CR]But then, I found some[CR]words in the game that didnt seem like credits. Even[CR]though they were[CR]written using roman letters, the seemed to be Japanese. What[CR]were these[CR]strange words? harmony7 figured it out from a Japanese web site and[CR]also[CR]told me how to display the text. But now, someone had to play the game[CR]so[CR]we could see the ending credits! That is where Damiano volunteered to[CR]help.[CR]And he did a great job getting me save-states at every point in the[CR]game where[CR]there was more text, although it turned out that the text after[CR]each boss was[CR]the same and was in English anyway.[CR]3 days after harmony7[CR]translated the ending text through IM, the translation[CR]patch was completed[CR]and tested by DvD.[CR](9)-------------------- harmony7s Translation Comments[CR]-----------------------[CR]Another classic game that Ive owned for ages. If[CR]you like blowing things up[CR]pointlessly, this game is for you.[CR]The text[CR]in this game was Japanese, but spelled out using the Western alphabet.[CR]This[CR]was a typical design decision back when games didnt have that much[CR]memory[CR]available to them.[CR]I personally thought that many of the[CR]translated quotes were only applicable to[CR]people who played games during[CR]that period, i.e., kids after school. I dont[CR]think that many adults in[CR]Japan played games back then. However, DvD said[CR]he thinks theyre okay, so I[CR]said go for it. But if you get any of the[CR]endings, youll see what I[CR]mean.[CR]Of course, whos going to spend 24 hours playing the game to see one[CR]sentence?[CR](10)--------------- Damianos Save State Acquisition Comments[CR]-----------------[CR]I came to know DvD through one of his other works, which[CR]was [CR]Dragon Slayer Jr. - Romancia. While researching the history of[CR]Japanese RPGs I [CR]had discoverd information about Dragon Slayer, which was[CR]rumored to be the very[CR]first JRPG ever. Released in 1984 it even outdated[CR]Hydlide, The Legend of Zelda[CR]and Dragon Quest/Dragon Warrior. I was fond of[CR]the idea of playing the [CR]Dragon-Slayer-Series and was overjoyed to learn[CR]that Part 1 and 2 were already [CR]written in English. With Part 3,[CR]aforementioned Dragon Slayer Jr. - Romancia, [CR]this was another story. It[CR]was in Japanese and only by coincidence I found[CR]DvDs translation for it.[CR]After playing it for awhile I contacted him to thank[CR]him and his friends[CR]for their good work on it and to get some help with one[CR]part. I received[CR]very kind aid and began to chat with DvD about old games until[CR]he asked me[CR]if I would be interested in helping him out with one of his[CR]smaller[CR]projects, which was this game: King Kong 2 - Ikaro no Megaton[CR]Punch. I was[CR]eager to help since I always admired fan translators for[CR]putting their time[CR]into their work so that other gamers could enjoy[CR]formerly untranslated games[CR]in English, German, Spanish and so on. And[CR]although my role had been a minor[CR]one in this project I am proud to have[CR]been able to contribute to one of those[CR]translations. Actually, all that[CR]DvD needed me to do was to play through the[CR]game and to collect savestats[CR]from right after beating the several bosses, but[CR]before the text sequences[CR]this game contains so that he can modify these. [CR]All in all, this game was[CR]tremendous fun, but I experienced it as hard as hell[CR]at first. It sure was[CR]irritating with all the warp gates all over the place and[CR]enemies swarming[CR]the screen! ;) But after I got a hang of it I was able to get[CR]through the[CR]game quite smoothly. I would recommend it to anyone who likes [CR]action-games[CR]or just Japanese games in general. [CR]It was fun contributing to this project[CR]and I enjoyed working with DvD who was [CR]always eager to answer my questions[CR]and to tell me how happy he was with the [CR]savestats.[CR]I would definitely[CR]do this again! :)[CR](11)--------------------- Project Timeline Highlights[CR]-------------------------[CR]Jan 2 2008 - Project Started by DvD[CR]Apr 25[CR]2008 - First new title screen completed[CR]May 14 2008 - Final new title[CR]screen completed[CR]Jun 3 2008 - Ending save state acquired[CR]Jun 4 2008 -[CR]Ending text translated[CR]Jun 7 2008 - Patch completed, testing completed,[CR]readme started[CR]Jun 9 2008 - Readme completed, Patch[CR]Released[CR](12)------------------ Software Used In This Translation[CR]----------------------[CR]* Emulators[CR] PC[CR] - FCEUXD SP 1.07[CR] If you[CR]like FCE Ultra, you will love FCEUXD SP.[CR] Thank you RedComet for pointing[CR]this one out.[CR] It is the emulator that I will be using from now on; its[CR]awesome.[CR] - FCEUltra v0.94[CR] by Bero and xodnizel[CR]* Tile Editor[CR] Tile Layer Pro 1.0[CR] by Kent Hansen[CR]* Disassembler, Table Dumper[CR]Table Dumper Pro (ver 8.6.7)[CR] by DvD[CR]* Hex Editors, Script Dumper[CR] -[CR]Thingy Version 0.98[CR] by necrosaro[CR]* Readme Creation[CR] Notepad (Win[CR]XP)[CR] by Microsoft[CR]* IPS Patch File Creator[CR] Snes-Tool Version 1.2[CR]by The[CR]M.C.A./Elite[CR]-------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]987654321098765432109876543210987654321[CR]123456789012345678901234567890123456789</plot>

    <plot>Knight Move is a chess-based puzzle/strategy game from famed Tetris creator Alexey Pajitnov in which the player has to traverse a chessboard using a knight's erratic L-shaped movement to collect hearts. While collecting hearts, the player may stand on the same square up to three times - after which the square disappears. These pitfalls will instantly end the game if the knight lands on them, but at the same time are the only way to score points: Collecting the heart will repair any holes and award points for each one, after which the heart moves to a new space and the game continues. The knight is always moving towards the spot indicated by the player (or to a random default square if the player hasn't acted) and will continue to move faster as the game progresses. This makes it less easy to plan out moves ahead of time and, eventually, difficult to aim the knight in the desired direction before the next move occurs.[CR]There is also a harder mode: Type B. In this mode the player must collect numerous hearts before the board's gaps are repaired and each heart has a timer: this is the number of moves the knight can make before the heart vanishes and a new one appears elsewhere.</plot>

The files[CR]============[CR]The zip archive[CR]contains 2 files, the readme you are now reading, and "ngdn2se1.ips",[CR]the[CR]actual patch file.[CR]3. Usage[CR]=========[CR]In order to use this,[CR]you will need a Ninja Gaiden 2 NES rom, which I will _not_ give to you, even[CR]if I could, I would not, since it is illegal to distribute roms. So dont[CR]bother[CR]me about that. Second, you will need an IPS patcher program, one can[CR]be found in the [CR]download section of our page, with the aid of which you[CR]will apply the patch[CR]file to an _english_ Ninja Gaiden 2 NES rom. This rom[CR]must not previously have been [CR]patched or altered in any way, since the[CR]patch will not work then.[CR]4. Questions, comments or[CR]suggestions[CR]=====================================[CR]If you have anything[CR]constructive to say, if you like this translation, if you want to[CR]know what[CR]other translations/hacks I have done/am doing, or perhaps even can offer[CR]some[CR]help with the bug-testing - contact me at kalle@eyecom.se.[CR]We also[CR]have a webpage, and thanks to Zoop and Uzplayer, at a nice place [CR](see[CR]bottom for adress).[CR](Note: I am in no way affiliated with NOA, NCL or TECMO[CR]LTD).[CR]5.

    <plot>Like almost everything Technos has ever made, Kunio Kun Soccer is a tribute to[CR]violence. It's a sequel to World Cup Soccer, which is the American[CR]bastardization of another Kunio game. Along with all the normal violence you'd[CR]come to expect from a Kunio sports game (namely, the ability to beat up other[CR]players to gain possession of the ball), this game offers some other[CR]interesting features. You have some weather effects, which make things more[CR]difficult by adding stuff like wind gusts and lightning strikes (which fry[CR]anyone who happens to be standing in a puddle). ALl the weather effects seem[CR]to tax the NES, however - thanks to good old slowdown. You also get to[CR]strategize, and tell the other players what to do, though most often they'll[CR]ignore you and run in circles and pass the ball to absolutely no one. Also[CR]this game supports up to 4 players which in the 4 player-mode, 2 players[CR]compete against another 2 ones. In each side there are one forward and one[CR]Goalkeeper. The rest of the players are controlled by CPU. It's an alright[CR]game, but there's probably much more soccer fun to be had[CR]elsewhere.[CR]Read Me:[CR]ICE Trans[CR]http://icetrans.emuviews.com[CR]Rom[CR]Translations and Hacks[CR]Copyright 2000 [CR]This heres a patch for the neeto[CR]soccer game Ive been workin on for a bit now.

    <plot>I don't know why GameFAQs refers to the game as "Reverence". I mean sure, you[CR]could think that if it were written out in katakana, but the name's right[CR]there. Maybe it's different on the cover box or something. Well, if you[CR]guessed that Labyrinth is based on the Jennifer Connelly movie of the same[CR]name, then you guessed rightly. I've never seen the movie, and I can't[CR]understand the game, so I can't tell you much about it, except that you're in[CR]a Labyrinth, and that Jennifer Connelly is hot and sexy. You pretty much just[CR]run around and shoot things that randomly pop up and attack you, and you can[CR]pick up various items. What's neat is you don't have a life meter; whenever[CR]you get hit you lose time. When your timer goes to zero, it's Game Over.[CR]Fortunately you can pick up little clocks to increase your time left, or you[CR]can buy time from people. Pretty interesting. What's not as cool is the fact[CR]that whenever your character gets hit, he flashes so that he doesn't get hit[CR]again for a second. But during that time, you can't move at all. So it's very[CR]easy to just sit there and get pummeled by this guy, and you can't even so[CR]much as run away from the fellow. It's not so bad, cause you can still shoot[CR]when you're immobile. The problem is those damn faeries! When they can fly[CR]over obstacles and move wherever they want at random and you can only shoot in[CR]eight cardinal directions...

    <plot>Lutter is a game comprised of single screens full of traps, obstacles, enemies and items that the eponymous hero Lutter must navigate in order to find six missing damsels and the enormous monsters that hold them hostage. The game has some element of non-linearity, as there are numerous paths that split off to explore. The chief goal is to find keys that unlock doors to new areas and eventually to large, screen-sized bosses that Lutter must defeat in shoot 'em up style boss fights.[CR]The game also features a few RPG aspects: Lutter has a health bar and can level up, which increases his health and other stats. He defeats enemies by charging into them, similarly to early action RPGs like the first Ys and Hydlide. When defeated, the game will automatically try to bribe the victorious monster with whatever funds the player has accrued: should they have enough to placate the monster (this amount often depends on the strength of the monster) Lutter reappears where he entered the screen with his health restored.</plot>

    <plot>Maharaja is an adventure game with RPG elements published by Sunsoft and developed by Quest. [CR]The protagonist is a young man who recovers a mystical treasure box belonging to the Maharaja from the river Ganges. He is rewarded with a feast for recovering the item, but the princess warns him later the same night that the Maharaja's generosity is a ruse and that he is being controlled by an evil wizard and plans to kill the hero in the morning. The hero escapes the palace to look for a way to free the Maharaja and rescue the princess, acquiring the assistance of the gods along the way.[CR]Maharaja features an adventure game interface with a small viewing window for whatever the player character is seeing as well as a list of commands on the side that the player character can try. Speech and other descriptive text appears below the picture window. In addition, the player can also find themselves embroiled in random battles which play out like other turn-based RPGs of the era. The player can find and equip new gear as well as learn new spells as the game continues.[CR]The game was never officially localized into English nor was it ever released outside of Japan. A fan translation was created in 2009, however.</plot>

    <plot>You're inside the fortress planet Zebes.  The planet of endless secret passageways where the Metroid are multiplying.  Left alone the Metroid are harmless.  But in the wrong hands they could destroy the galaxy.  It's up to you to prevent the Mother Brain that controls Zebes from using the Metroid for evil purposes.  But that won't be easy.  You'll have to use your spacesuit to absorb valuable energy for your search to gain the use of power items like the Ice Beam, Wave Beam, High Jump Boots and Varia.  If you survive, it will be you and your acquired powers against the Mother Brain.</plot>

Project[CR]History[CR]--------------------[CR]- I wanted to find an extremely difficult,[CR]time consuming, and [CR]challenging game to translate. Mini Golf seemed like[CR]the [CR]perfect candidate.. b/c most of the game was already in [CR]english.[CR]So, after playing for several hours trying to beat [CR]par (and I did... on a[CR]hole or two), I came to the realization [CR]that Id never beat the game, so Id[CR]never get to see if there [CR]was any ending text or credits or other stuff in[CR]Japanese. So [CR]I went through the game with a couple of programs and saw no[CR]japanese whatsoever besides the title screen. So I translated [CR]the[CR]title screen (gee, really hard.. its the title of the [CR]game!), editted the[CR]tiles to make an extremely poor title [CR]graphic, and made the patch.[CR]End[CR]of story.[CR]--------------------[CR]III.[CR]Completed[CR]--------------------[CR]- To the best of my knowledge,[CR]everything.[CR]--------------------[CR]IV.[CR]Incomplete[CR]--------------------[CR]- Nothing, hopefully.

Without the help, I wouldnt have known whether[CR]this [CR]was a translation or a hack, what to do with softcore porn in[CR]translations, or the fact that Umihara Kawase rocks.[CR]- The Whirlpool[CR](http://donut.parodius.com), RPGd [CR](http://rpgd.emulationworld.com), and[CR]all the other cool[CR]translation/emulation sites I regularly visit.[CR]-[CR]final exams for summer school, for giving me the drive to do[CR]something[CR]creative other than studying.[CR]- my computer, for not completely dying[CR]yet.[CR]- all other people out there who helped or encouraged me, or [CR]who[CR]are just cool people.[CR]--------------------[CR]VI.

    <plot>This is a very strange game. It's a platform puzzler, and it reminds me[CR]somewhat of Lolo for some reason.

Anyway, as[CR]easy as collecting things and going through doors may sound, it ain't! There's[CR]all sorts of critters out to get you, and rocks to push around and bricks to[CR]head-butt.

You need three things. A ROM,[CR] the patch and a patching program. To[CR]patch with IPS, you simply[CR] type "ips  ". So if the name of the ROM was[CR]HKFS.nes you would type "ips HKFS.nes HKFS.ips" and your ROM is now[CR] in[CR]English. Make sure you have all the files in the same directory[CR] if you[CR]have a problem.[CR] To patch a ROM with SNES Tool, simply select USE IPS,[CR]choose[CR] the patch and then choose the ROM to affix the patch to. Its[CR]self[CR] explanatory.

    <plot>Cosmo Police Galivan is simply the epitome of "badass". In Jair's own words,[CR]"This game is a nifty platform RPG that's sort of like a cross between Metroid[CR]and Strider, but cooler." In my own words, "Konami completely ripped off this[CR]game when they were making the gameplay engine for Castlevania: Symphony of[CR]the Night." Anyway, if those descriptions don't help you, the gist of the game[CR]is that you run around in a side-scrolling environemnt, kicking the crap out[CR]of bad guys with sword, and finding items so that you may advance farther -[CR]items that make you jump higher, better weapons, etc. All while you level up[CR]in a standard RPG expereince system. It's a really fun game, and you're really[CR]missing out if you don't find the ROM and try it out.[CR]Read Me:[CR]Cosmo[CR]Police Galivan[CR]English translation patch v. 1.00, 4/21/2000[CR]By Jair,[CR]http://fly.to/vale[CR]------------------------------------[CR]You should now[CR]have:[CR]galivan.txt (This file)[CR]gali-100.ips (The[CR]patch)[CR]------------------------------------[CR]What it is:[CR]This is a[CR]patch to translate Galivan into English.

Try the ROM Request Boards at[CR]http://members.tripod.com/~DooMStalk/ if youre having trouble finding[CR]one.[CR]You can find Snes-tool and a variety of emulators at most general[CR]emulation sites, such as sgc.emu2k.com and www.zophar.net.[CR]First make a[CR]backup copy of the ROM. Run Snes-tool and choose "Use IPS." Choose[CR]"gali-100.ips." Choose your Galivan ROM. It should say, "IPS patched ok." Now[CR]youre ready to play! Fire up your emulator of choice and[CR]enjoy.[CR]------------------------------------[CR]Gameplay notes and[CR]advice:[CR]To talk to people, duck in front of them. And if you want to talk[CR]to them again, you have to leave and re-enter the room.[CR]To use the warp[CR]holes (the computer terminals), push A and B at the same time in front of[CR]them.[CR]Crystal Power (CP) is like MP. You need it to use special weapons and[CR]items.[CR]When the "GP" gauge fills up (by collecting Ps), your nifty cyborg[CR]armor will activate. When youre wearing your armor, you take half damage, but[CR]every hit reduces the GP gauge, and when it runs out your armor[CR]vanishes.[CR]This game is full of secret passages that you must find. If you[CR]dont pay close attention to the clues people give you, you wont have a chance.[CR]If you get stuck, remember to try using your special weapons and the Crystal[CR]items in likely places.[CR]This games bosses are difficult, but they move in[CR]fairly simple patterns. Try to figure out a way to avoid damage and wear them[CR]down.[CR]If all else fails, Im writing an FAQ / walkthrough which should be[CR]online in a few days. Or you can ask on the Vale message[CR]board.[CR]------------------------------------[CR]Special thanks to:[CR]MO,[CR]for valuable translation help[CR]SnowBro, for making Tile Layer[CR]Necrosaro,[CR]for making Thingy[CR]BPSoft, for making Hex Workshop[CR]loopy, for making a[CR]great NES emulator[CR]AWJ, for helping me figure out DTE ages and ages ago,[CR]which is totally irrelevant to this particular project, but I never thanked[CR]him publicly and felt like it, so there[CR]All the other people whove helped[CR]me out or have just generally been fun to hang out with ^_^</plot>

    <plot>This game was originally released by Gremlin Graphics in 1986 for ZX Spectrum[CR]and C64 comptuers, as part of a series of games starring Monty Mole as the[CR]main character. The orignial version had him thrown in jail for stealing coal[CR]during the British [miners[CR]strike](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_miners%27_strike_%281984%E2%80%931985%29)[CR]of the 1980s, and with the aid of his handy rescue pack make for the continent[CR]via Dover docks. As you can see, for Monty to make it in Japan some changes[CR]were going to be made when Jaleco picked up the license in '87\\. What you get[CR]though hardly bears any resemblance to the computer original (though the Rob[CR]Hubbard theme tune survives). Monty is now a man, who through a horrible[CR]miscarriage of justice must clear his name by finding pieces of a photograph[CR]of the real culprit scattered through 4 levels. It's a lot easier than the[CR]original computer versions, and while the NES is hardly starved of[CR]platformers, its actually not that bad, no thanks to Jaleco's bowdlerisation.[CR]Thanks to all the hard work of Stardust Translations you can now enjoy it in[CR]English.[CR]Read[CR]Me:[CR]=========================================================[CR]=====================Monty[CR]on the Run====================[CR]=========================V[CR]1.00==========================[CR]Genre: Platformer[CR]Source language:[CR]Japanese[CR]Platform: FDS[CR]Patch language: English[CR]Author:[CR]Pennywise[CR]E-mail:[CR]yojimbogarrett@gmail.com[CR]http://yojimbo.eludevisibility.org/[CR]======================================================[CR]About Monty on[CR]the[CR]Run[CR]======================================================[CR]Background:[CR]This was a game I used to introduce me to the FDS a bit[CR]and it served[CR]its purpose.

If using[CR]the IPS, you need[CR]to run the diskexpander program first[CR]before patching.[CR]For the BPS[CR]patch, all you need to do is download beat[CR]and apply the patch to the[CR]image.[CR]http://byuu.org/programming/[CR]Apply either patch to the Japanese[CR]version of the game:[CR]Monty on the Run - Monty no Doki Doki Dai Dassou[CR](Japan) [b].fds[CR]We would be highly grateful, if you find some time to[CR]contact us with proposals or corrections.

The game seemed easy enough to hack so I was on my way![CR]While[CR]searching for information on the game, I found a walkthrough by a person named[CR]Frizzy, who had played the game previously. A quick e-mail[CR]later and I sent[CR]Frizzy the games script, which was promptly translated[CR]and sent back. A far[CR]cry from the trouble I had getting Glory of[CR]Heracles script[CR]translated![CR]Overall, the project went mostly smoothly, especially once I[CR]got myself[CR]up to date with the usage of Atlas and Cartographer. A few very[CR]basic[CR]assembly hacks were implemented and the game was finished rather[CR]quickly.[CR]Voila.[CR]Whats Been Done:[CR]-----------------[CR]All text[CR]translated.[CR]Dual Tile Encoding script implemented.[CR]Main characters name[CR]limit expanded from 4 characters to 8.[CR]Added Ms. Takeuchis portrait to the[CR]ending (it was inexplicably missing from the Japanese version).[CR]Recolored[CR]Amis sprites hair blue (it was inexplicably brown in the Japanese[CR]version).[CR]Slightly restructured how the menu displays food[CR]inventory.[CR]Added the power to the descriptions of several weapons that[CR]didnt display in theJapanese version.[CR]Gameplay[CR]Notes:[CR]---------------[CR]This game is based on a Japanese magazine,[CR]Nakayoshi, that publishes Shoujo (girl) manga. Your character must traverse[CR]six worlds, based on six manga (Goldfish Warning!, Pocket Park, MinMin!,[CR]Taiyou ni Smash, Kurumi and the 7 Dwarfs and[CR]Sailor Moon) to restore[CR]order.[CR]This game is somewhat of a beginners RPG. The battles arent random,[CR]they are initiated by talking to NPCs. All battles can be run from with[CR]100%[CR]success, with the exceptions of three bosses. Food items can be used[CR]to[CR]restore your HP without using up your turn.[CR]The biggest departure of[CR]this game is how it handles battles. When fighting, other than choosing to eat[CR]food or run, the only thing you have control over[CR]is to select which[CR]element (Fire, Ice, Lightning) you want to use. Then, a[CR]three-reel slot[CR]will start. Generally, you get three attacks per round, one[CR]for each reel,[CR]as does the enemy. A fist icon lets you attack, a bag icon[CR]lets you use a[CR]weapon from your inventory at random, a gem icon lets you use[CR]a magical gem[CR]from your inventory at random (the gems come in three elements,[CR]Fire, Ice[CR]and Lightning... the element you selected when you started the[CR]slots[CR]determines which type of gem youll attack with), a star usually[CR]does[CR]nothing, unless you get two in a row, which causes a consecutive[CR]attack (this rounds attack will do double-damage, but youll only attack once),[CR]and a face[CR]will usually do nothing, but sometimes your companion will heal[CR]you completely[CR]when you land on a face. Getting three items, fists, gems or[CR]stars unleashes a[CR]super-powerful attack. Also, in the final chapter, more[CR]icons are added to[CR]your reels as you rescue characters.[CR]Visit[CR]http://www.rpgclassics.com/shrines/nes/nakayoshi for much more[CR]information.[CR]Translation Notes:[CR]------------------[CR]As of the time of[CR]my writing this, the only manga featured in this game to have had any sort of[CR]English translation is Sailor Moon. Thus, a unique[CR]dilemma presented itself[CR]concerning the translations of the names from that[CR]chapter. Should we go[CR]with direct translations? Or use the established[CR]translations from the[CR]English dub? I was initially going to go with the[CR]more accurate, direct[CR]translations, but I decided that this may alienate[CR]some fans of the subbed[CR]version. So, I decided it would be quite simple to [CR]create two patches, one[CR]using the subtitled naming conventions, and one using the more direct[CR]translations. Now, the choice is in YOUR hands as to what the characters names[CR]will be called. Heres a list of the differences between[CR]the two[CR]patches:[CR]Usagi Serena[CR]Ami Amy[CR]Rei Raye[CR]Makoto Lita[CR]Minako[CR]Mina[CR]Motoki Andrew[CR]Umino Melvin[CR]Naru Molly[CR]Sailor Soldier Sailor[CR]Scout[CR]Moon Frisbee Moon Tiara Magic[CR]Moon Prism Power Make-Up Moon Prism[CR]Power[CR]Moon Princess Halation Moon Scepter Elimination[CR]Burning Mandala[CR]Mars Fire Surround[CR]Akuryo Taisen Mars Fireball Charge[CR]Shine Aqua[CR]Illusion Mercury Ice Storm Splash[CR]Sparkling Wide Pressure Jupiter[CR]Thunderclap Zap[CR]Venus Love-Me Chain Venus Love Chain Encircle[CR]Azabu-[CR]Juuban Crossroads[CR]Keep in mind that the two patches are IDENTICAL except[CR]for the above differences.[CR]Known Issues:[CR]-------------[CR]In expanding[CR]the name limit from 4 to 8 characters, on the "load screen", if the name[CR]of[CR]your character is 7 or 8 characters, the seventh character will be overwritten[CR]by[CR]the chapter number your file currently is saved on.

    <plot>I've actually been fortunate enough to play this game on cart, with three[CR]other people with rahga's amazing four-player adapter. It's a Technos game,[CR]which means two things: one, all the characters look like they do in all the[CR]other Technos games, and two, it involves these characters beating the hell[CR]out of each other. This is why people love Technos games. You can play two-on-[CR]two, or a four-player free-for-all, or a variety of other stuff. You play in a[CR]smallish arena, and beat each other up, and whoever's left standing wins.[CR]Totally fun! When you die you turn into food, which is really weird. So one of[CR]the other characters can actually eat your dead hamburger corpse, and gain[CR]back some life. The controls are pretty hard to get used to, but once you do[CR]you can really kick some ass.[CR]Read Me:[CR]oRdErEDchaos Translations[CR]presents[CR]Riki Kunio[CR]a Technos Nekketsu series game[CR]Version[CR].95[CR]October 18, 1998[CR]-Text 98% translated, New Title Screen, other[CR]corrections made[CR]This is the first official patch of Riki Kunio the English[CR]Translation.

    <plot>The player and his girlfriend must find their way back home after being sucked into an alternate universe.[CR]A magnificent castle full of 25 different game worlds block their progress, however, and they are filled with enemies on every stage.The player has an overhead view to destroy the enemies for extra loot. Given a strict time limit of 100 seconds to solve each puzzle, the game rewards fast puzzle solvers. The first player controls the male while the second player controls the female. Players only start with three lives and lose them when time runs out or when a monster comes into contact with him/her.</plot>

The object of the game is to roll those balls over the table. As soon as all ten balls are on one player's side, that player loses the game. Each game also has a time limit of 60 seconds; if that is reached, the player with the fewest balls on their side wins.</plot>

    <plot>Pescatore is a puzzle game, developed by Tierheit and meant to be published by Sunsoft. Like Sunman, it never saw the light of day neither in the land of the rising sun nor the home of the brave. Nor even in places in between, as was the case with several other Sunsoft titles of the time. Unlike Sunman, however, Pescatore was briefly revealed to the public in spring of 1991 at Nintendo's Shoshinkai Show.[CR]The gameplay in Pescatore borrows the gameplay from PuyoPuyo and changes the rules slightly to require less skill and more luck.</plot>

    <plot>Learn basic katakana with Popeye and friends! Whee yeah hurrays! Popeye's[CR]Lingo Game takes the ever-popular "what the hell is this katakana word[CR]supposed to actually MEAN" game and, well... turns it into a real live game.[CR]If you're one of those (many, many, many) people that don't know what katakana[CR]is, don't worry about it. That's why the world has ROM translations. So[CR]anyways, in Word Puzzle A, you choose a category, and you're given a word in[CR]katakana, which you must decipher into its English equivalent. In its original[CR]form, this could be a nice little katakana primer for you budding first-year[CR]Japanese students. The problem is, it's not intended for the English-speaking[CR]populace. So, sometimes you get the actual Japanese word in katakana, which[CR]has no relation at all to the word in English. At that point, you're pretty[CR]much on your own. Word Puzzle B does away with the Japanese entirely and just[CR]gives you some blanks. At this point the game just becomes Hangman with a[CR]Popeye theme. Yawn.

    <plot>This game plays like crap, and involves incessantly mashing the A button to[CR]move your horse forward, and you always lose anyways (unless you've got some[CR]Turbo thing enabled). So, it's a typical hentai game in that respect. Once you[CR]win a certain amount of money, the chick you chose takes off a little bit of[CR]her clothes, and.. yeah. Anyway, that's the game for you. Sounds like tons of[CR]fun, right? Well it's not.[CR]Read Me:[CR] (insert elite ascii graphic[CR]here)[CR] Pretty Girls Sexy Derby 1.3 (18 November 1999)[CR] Official Readme[CR]File![CR]------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]I.[CR]Introduction[CR]II. Project[CR]IIa. Project Members[CR]IIb. Tools[CR]IIc.[CR]History[CR]III. End-User Information[CR]IV. Thx[CR]V. Legal stuff that would[CR]never hold up in[CR]court[CR]------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Introduction[CR]Pretty Girls Sexy Derby has FINALLY been translated to[CR]English!!![CR]*parade*[CR]OK, its not the greatest of accomplishments, and its[CR]not like anyone cares,[CR]but here it is, a complete English translation. The[CR]original Bishoujo Sexy[CR]Derby was released by the pirate company Super Pig[CR](a part of Hacker[CR]International) for the Famicom Disk System, and yes, its[CR]a hentai game. For[CR]those who arent cultured enough to know what that means,[CR]"hentai" is Japanese[CR]for "pervert." So "hentai" could be used to describe[CR]either a really perverted[CR]guy, or pr0n. :) Actually this game might be[CR]described as "ecchi," which, in[CR]certain anime circles, is just a tamer form[CR]of hentai. All this game really[CR]shows are naked breasts, as opposed to..[CR]Well you dont want to know.[CR]Pirate hentai games are quite abundant for the[CR]Famicom Disk System. Amazingly[CR]enough, this is one of the more playable[CR]ones.[CR]------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Project[CR]This was finished (for the most part) in about two days: the first[CR]involved[CR]the menu translations, the second involved the script dump and[CR]dialogue. It[CR]was very very simple, and was pretty damn easy to hack. Im[CR]quite happy with[CR]the end result, so I dont think Ill be messing with this[CR]much anymore.[CR]Members:[CR]--------[CR]Spinner 8[CR](spinner_8@softhome.net)[CR] - text hacking, script dump, title screen hack,[CR]the usual stuff[CR]Darkmazda (darkmazda@microdsi.net)[CR] - translating![CR]Tools used:[CR]-----------[CR]Microsoft Windows 98 by Microsoft Corp.[CR](http://www.microsoft.com)[CR]Famtasia 5.0 by Nori and Taka2[CR](http://www.tsukuba.venture-web.or.jp/~ppm/famicom/)[CR]NJStar Communicator[CR]2.1 by NJStar Software Corp.[CR] (http://www.njstar.com)[CR]Tile Layer 0.50b[CR]by Snowbro[CR] (http://home.sol.no/~kenhanse/)[CR]Thingy 0.98 by necrosaro[CR](http://members.aol.com/sabindude/)[CR]Relative Searcher 2.5 by Jair[CR](http://www.resnet.trinity.edu/gknodle/)[CR]Paint Shop Pro 6.00 Beta by Jasc[CR]Software[CR] (http://www.jasc.com)[CR]Snes-Tool 1.2 by the M.C.A and Elite[CR](?)[CR] [CR]Patch history![CR]--------------[CR]Version 1.3 - Finally figured[CR]out the pointers! Turns out they were just[CR] Ballzy Tables. How[CR]embarrassing! :) I took the opportunity to[CR] go over all the text and[CR]rearrange it and reword it so it looks[CR] much much better. It loses its[CR]faithfulness to Darkmazdas[CR] translation just a teensy bit, but thats a[CR]small sacrifice now[CR] that most of it actually makes sense. :)[CR]Version[CR]1.00 - Everything should be translated! Go forth and[CR]jax0r.[CR]------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]End-User[CR]This is about how to play the game! Because thats why you[CR]downloaded it![CR]Right? Well anyway, first youll need to apply the patch to[CR]the rom. Youll[CR]have to find the rom yourself, but make SURE that the rom[CR]has the .fds[CR]extension, not .fam or .dka or whatever else. This patch will[CR]ONLY work on[CR]the .fds format rom. OK, got the rom? Now use an ips patcher[CR]to apply the[CR]patch! Ive included ips.exe in this zip for your convenience.[CR]Make sure that[CR]the rom, patch, and ips.exe are all in the same directory,[CR]and now enter this[CR]in the DOS command prompt:[CR]ips.exe bsd.fds[CR]sexy.ips[CR](This assumes that the rom is bsd.fds of course! Be sure and[CR]change that to[CR]whatever your roms name is.) This tells ips.exe to take the[CR]file bsd.fds and[CR]apply the patch sexy.ips to it. Now you should be all set![CR]If you have any[CR]more problems with ips patching, then may God help[CR]you.[CR]Now, youre ready to play! Right? OK! If youve never used a Famicom[CR]Disk[CR]System rom before, heres how to do it. It plays basically the same,[CR]but[CR]since its a disk, you have to do a few extra things. Right now the[CR]only[CR]emulators you can use are fwNES and Famtasia, and loopynes. Dont ask[CR]me how[CR]to run it in loopynes, because I dont know. :) Anyway, go ahead and[CR]load the[CR]rom. In fwNES the FDS BIOS screen will load, and now you can[CR]insert your disk.[CR]Hit F5 here. That is the key for when you want to insert[CR]or eject a disk. Make[CR]sure its at Side A, or youll get a disk error. In[CR]Famtasia, you can just[CR]load the rom, and the disk will be inserted for you[CR]automatically. Now play![CR]When it tells you to change to Side B, in fwnes[CR]hit F5, F6, and then F5 again.[CR]F6 is the key for when you want to switch a[CR]disk, so what youre doing is[CR]ejecting Side A, switching to Side B, and then[CR]inserting Side B. Dont just[CR]hit F6 to switch to Side B, because that wont[CR]work. You have to eject it[CR]first. In Famtasia, you can just hit F5. F5[CR]ejects the disk you have, then[CR]switches to the next side and inserts it[CR]automatically! How clever![CR]OK! Now for the actual game. What youre doing is[CR]racing horses for money, and[CR]the girls take off various articles of[CR]clothing when you get more and more[CR]money. To go faster on your horse, you[CR]have to hit the A button a lot. So the[CR]game is basically hitting the A[CR]button as fast as you possibly can. Thats it.[CR]Pretty sad, isnt it? Well..[CR]what the hell did you expect?![CR]:P[CR]------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Thanks![CR]A HUGE thanks to Darkmazda, who translated all of the dialogue![CR](Well, some[CR] people might consider that stuff dialogue. :P) Translators[CR]hardly EVER get[CR] the credit that they deserve, so email him and tell him[CR]how much you[CR] appreciate his work! Dammit![CR] [CR]Thanks to Moose M., who[CR]helped me out on quite a vulgar spot translation.[CR] Honorable Mention goes[CR]to Jair, maht, and Yousei for trying to figure it[CR] out. :)[CR] [CR]Thanks[CR]to Ballz, who designed the title screen. He wouldve hacked it in too,[CR] but[CR]he was too busy with other stuff, undoubtedly getting drunk off his[CR] ass[CR]every night. Lucky bastard.[CR] [CR]A gigantic super thanks to Nori and Taka2[CR]for coding Famtasia! Hacking would[CR] have been a lot more difficult and[CR]infinitely more frustrating if it[CR] werent for this absolutely excellent[CR]emulator, and probably would never[CR] have been done at all.[CR] [CR]Thanks[CR]to all the programmers of all the programs that were used in the[CR] making of[CR]this blasted thing, especially necrosaro and Jair! Relative[CR] Searcher is a[CR]lifesaver, believe you me![CR] [CR]Thanks to Super Pig, for making such a[CR]wonderful game. Also thanks to[CR] Capcom, who made the wonderful font that I[CR]ripped off. However, the[CR] question mark is my own doing. :)[CR]Thanks to[CR]all the chicks of #romhack, for putting up with me. They didnt[CR] contribute[CR]to this translation in any way, but I still felt like[CR] apologizing.[CR]And thanks to all the emulator programmers, hackers, dumpers, and[CR]everyone[CR] else who has ever made a positive impact on the emulation[CR]community.[CR] Emulation would have been just a passing thing if it werent for[CR]the[CR] dedication of all the people involved and their love for preservation[CR]of[CR] old games. Well, that and its illegal and free.[CR]------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Legal Made-up Stuff[CR]Is this game legal? Quite possibly! I mean, it IS a[CR]pirate game after all. So[CR]all of Nintendos questionable trademark copyright[CR]things really hold no water[CR]here, do they now? But of course, does that[CR]mean the game itself is illegal?[CR]Hmmm, interesting. I assume that its OK,[CR]by the same grounds that Bleem[CR]hasnt been struck down yet. But still, what[CR]if Super Pig happens to be a[CR]lame whining moneygrubbing pathetic asshole[CR]and demands that all[CR]distribution of all products that make no money for[CR]them anymore cease[CR]immediately under some outdated copyright laws that were[CR]made to protect a[CR]completely different medium? This is all hypothetical, of[CR]course. Im sure[CR]that no company could be so unbelievably tightassed, right?[CR]Right? Aw hell,[CR]Ill just be safe and say dont use this patch. Its a very[CR]extreme case of[CR]copyright infringement. How did I make it then? Why, I just[CR]took a random jpeg[CR]off the net, changed random values with a hex editor,[CR]and released it so I[CR]could soak up all that praise that accompanies such a[CR]anticipated release. Any[CR]actual effects this may have on any software are[CR]PURELY coincidental. So fuck[CR]you and leave me alone.</plot>

    <plot>One of the ways in which Rainbow Silkroad is neat is because it's somewhat[CR]loosely based on historical fact. Not so historical as that you'd actually[CR]learn something, but just enough that you'd say "oh hey, that's neat" every[CR]once in a while. You take the role of the long-lost prince of Littleland, who[CR]must reclaim his throne from the guy Zrool that took the throne and was evil.[CR]Yeah the plot sucks, but it's irrelevant to the coolness that is this game.[CR]Instead the heart of the game is commerce. You take advantage of prices of[CR]various goods in various towns, and go back and forth trading goods to get[CR]more money. And don't think you can just kill monsters instead; all that[CR]monsters give you are License Points that, when enough are collected, will get[CR]you a license to trade in a certain good, such as oil. You don't have any[CR]stats or experience either! The only way you can increase your attack or HP or[CR]whatever is by buying more powerful weapons and armor. Sounds cool, doesn't[CR]it? Of course it does, dammit! So go play![CR]Read Me:[CR]Rainbow Silkroad[CR]3-2-99 (public release[CR]2-7-99)[CR]------------------------------------------------[CR]English[CR]Translation version 1.01[CR]--------------------------------[CR]from Gaijin[CR]Productions (of CTC)[CR]by Translator/Romhacker Musashi[CR] Special Romhacking[CR]Assistance from MadHacker[CR]Version 1.01[CR]------------[CR]-Warning.txt[CR]added to zip, a crash prevention measure[CR]Version[CR]1.00[CR]------------[CR]-100% of the Game text is translated[CR]-All commands,[CR]items, weapons, armors, goods, and enemies translated[CR]-Title Screen[CR]translated[CR]-Window borders graphically retouched[CR]About the[CR]Game[CR]--------------[CR]You have just learned that you are a prince from a[CR]small kingdom off of the [CR]Silkroad called Littleland. When you were young[CR]evil forces conspired against[CR]your family resulting in your parents demise.[CR]Fortunately, a loyal family [CR]retainer, Radley, was able to whisk you away[CR]to safety and left you in the care [CR]of the old family wet nurse. Now you[CR]must find the pieces of the Rainbow Mirror[CR]scattered across the Silkroad in[CR]order to return home. Armed with this item you[CR]will be able to reveal the[CR]truth and reclaim your kingdom.[CR]The game has a strong commerce element. You[CR]must trade goods in the cities along [CR]the Silkroad. You have access to[CR]several basic goods/commodities in the beginning, [CR]but as you fight you[CR]earn License Points (LP) which allow you to earn a new License [CR]for the[CR]area you are in. A License permits you to trade a good you previously[CR]never had access to before. You do not gain levels either. Instead as you[CR]make [CR]money you buy new arms which increases your strength and total[CR]HP.[CR]About the Project[CR]-----------------[CR]This was the first romhacking[CR]project I ever attempted. At the beginning of summer of [CR]1998 I left for[CR]home and decided to learn try my hand at NES romhacking. All I had[CR]were[CR]tools and utilities gathered from various sites and all the romhacking[CR]docs I could find.[CR]I tried for a few days then gave up finding it tedious[CR]and having to start my summer job. [CR]I had made very, very little progress.[CR]Two weeks before having to return to college my [CR]summer job ended. I[CR]decided to try my hand at Silkroad again. A little into it I decided [CR]to[CR]start over and in those two weeks I had successfully translated 15% of the[CR]game. [CR]However I had done this without a script dump and a disgustingly[CR]huge amount of "two [CR]letters in one tile" combinations. Well after that I[CR]had a few people playtest this alpha [CR]and MadHacker did some great[CR]enhancements but after all this I left the project on the shelf.[CR]Then[CR]winter break hit (December 19th I think). The week before it began I decided[CR]to learn [CR]ver basic script dumping and using Jairs utility Script Extractor[CR](yeah, Im one of [CR]the few who doesnt use Thingy) I had dumped the entire[CR]script as well as several lists. [CR]I went home and booted up the old 486 and[CR]started all over again. A couple of days [CR]before winter break ended[CR](January 19th) I had completed all the translating and romhacking.[CR]I[CR]returned and look for playtesters. I found a few willing to do so and sent[CR]them the beta. [CR]As time passed they sent me bugs and fixed those up. I also[CR]had some fantastic assistance from Madhacker. He did wonders with expanding[CR]certain areas I couldnt. Now, into the [CR]beginning of February, Wampus[CR]reported in being the first and so far only (besides myself) [CR]person to[CR]finish the game. Well this project has waited long enough so here it is,[CR]Rainbow Silkroad released...[CR]Ive worked long enough on this one and there[CR]are only a few buggy things left. The enemies [CR]Cpede and Mpede have yet to[CR]be changed. Its easy enough to do it but Im lazy. Also the[CR]store sign[CR]bother me but thats how they were don in the Japanese version. If I had 50 or[CR]so [CR]extra tiles free i could replace the letters with graphic signs but i[CR]dont. Finally the[CR]buy/sell options are condensed. Ive done everything I can[CR]but cant expand it unless I[CR]sacrafice something else so that stays. Well[CR]thats it. If theres text error tell me, if [CR]you want to complain I dont[CR]want to here it.[CR]Thanks[CR]------[CR]-Everyone at CTC for their[CR]support[CR]-MadHacker for his invaluable help[CR]-My Alpha Playtesters:[CR]Wampus[CR] Cybergen[CR] Jandar[CR] Gravedancer[CR]_My Beta Playtesters:[CR]Wampus[CR] Wildbill[CR] Jair[CR] ~* aStROcReEp 2000 *~[CR] Efaria[CR]Toma/Hello Keroppi[CR] (Hope I got everyone)[CR]-Taichou, for providing[CR]webspace for the Gaijin Production site[CR]-My tools: Script Extractor (by[CR]Jair), Hex Workshop, Nesticle 0.42, and SNEStool[CR]Contact[CR]-------[CR]To[CR]contact me, Musashi of Gaijin Productions, e-mail me[CR]at:[CR]musashi007@hotmail.com[CR]Visit Gaijin Productions[CR]at:[CR]http://taichou.dynip.com/Gaijin/Gaijin.htm[CR]Or if that site goes down[CR]for good (which I very seriously doubt)[CR]try:[CR]http://members.tripod.com/~Musashi007/Gaijin.htm[CR]Also visit the[CR]Confederated Translation Company, of which Gaijin Productions is a[CR]member:[CR]http://members.xoom.com/ctctrans/</plot>

Although the main inspiration was probably[CR]the Space[CR]Sheriff trilogy. If youre unfamiliar with the[CR]series in general, think of[CR]it along the lines of[CR]Power Rangers stuff.[CR]This game has quite a unique[CR]turn-based battle system,[CR]which is worth experiencing, lovely characters[CR]and[CR]a well-done script.[CR]We also uploaded the manual translated in[CR]English,[CR]so you can consult it, if you have any difficulties.[CR]And one[CR]last thing, do buy the game if you liked it[CR]as much as we did ;) We do not[CR]mean that you buy a[CR]repro that destroys a donor cart and profits off of[CR]our[CR]hard work.[CR]======================================================[CR]SPECIAL[CR]NOTICE[CR]======================================================[CR]Id very[CR]grateful, if you send me reports about bugs[CR]or glitches found during[CR]gameplay, but please, do not[CR]forget to add some descriptions, savestates[CR]and names[CR]of emulators you use.

I[CR]thought itd be nice to do the sequel,[CR]since the first two games[CR]storylines tie very closely together. I knew of[CR]another group doing it,[CR]at http://members.xoom.com/ys_project/ but they[CR]hadnt updated in two[CR]years. I read about their problem, and thought I could[CR]help out. But[CR]a day or so after emailing them, it bounced back. So I just[CR]decided to[CR]take it on myself. I was fortunate that the text was encoded in[CR]the[CR]same style as Ys 1. It did take a little longer to finish than[CR]I[CR]expected, but that was no problem.[CR]I dont plan on doing any more Ys[CR]games, since the third part is[CR]already available on the SNES and Genesis[CR]consoles (I recommend the[CR]Genesis one, myself). And parts four and five are[CR]being taken care of.[CR]If you ever get the chance, be sure to play the Turbo[CR]Duo version of[CR]Ys Book I-II. Although its quite old, its still an excellent[CR]classic.[CR]============[CR]Instructions[CR]============[CR]The file[CR]"ys2e.ips" must be patched to the original ROM image to play[CR]this[CR]translation. Any IPS patching utility should work. Two commonly[CR]used[CR]utilities are IPS.exe and Snestool. You can find these two[CR]programs at most[CR]emulation websites.[CR]*** Always keep a backup of the original ROM image.[CR]***[CR]To use IPS.exe, run this at a command prompt:[CR]IPS  [CR]Snestool has[CR]a graphic interface that makes it easier. After starting[CR]it, select "Use[CR]IPS", then select the IPS file, then the ROM image[CR]that it should be used[CR]on.[CR]This game has been tested with the NESten and Nesticle emulators.[CR]If[CR]the game shows jerkiness or flashing, try tweaking the[CR]timing[CR]settings.[CR]==========[CR]DISCLAIMER[CR]==========[CR]Ys 2 is[CR](c)1988 Nihon Falcom.

    <plot>Samurai Sword is an adventure game developed and published by Capcom for the Famicom Disk System in Japan towards the end of 1988. The player is an unnamed hero who is promptly defeated by the game's antangonist Soron and whisked away before the moment of his demise in order to find a way to counter Soron's considerable magical might.[CR]While the game may resemble an RPG at first, it is actually a traditional Famicom adventure game, similar to Portopia Renzoku Satsujin Jiken or Princess Tomato in the Salad Kingdom. The player can select from a set of commands for the hero to follow such as looking around, talking to NPCs, picking up items and so on. While there are battles, they can only be resolved by finding the right command (often the right spell) rather than the standard RPG method of exchanging blows governed by various statistics.</plot>

    <plot>This is a great game. As the name implies, it's a volley ball game with Sanrio[CR]characters. Which instantly makes it fun. You basically hit the volley ball[CR]back and forth until someone misses it or hits it out of bounds. Simple? Yes![CR]But still very fun. You also may have heard a rumor that that Kunio Volley[CR]Ball game kicks this game's ass in. Well, that rumor is just wrong. Sorry[CR]Kunio. Well-played, but you just FELL SHORT. This is the real thing folks.[CR]Because it's Sanrio. PLay it!

There are[CR]errors present and I dont care. [CR]-Title Screen Translated by Braxton, I[CR](Musashi) did some minor touch-ups[CR]About the Game[CR]--------------[CR]In[CR]this volleyball/four square type game you can play as one of 4 Sanrio[CR]characters. Those fun guys are: Hello Kitty, Kerropi, Tabo, and Pochacco. The[CR]game has a 1 on 1 singles mode, doubles play, and 1 on 3 four squares mode.[CR]About the Project[CR]-----------------[CR]I started this project sometime[CR]in the Fall of 1998.

    <plot>Santa Claus no Takarabako: Possibly the strangest release from Data East evar.[CR]It's actually two things in one; a computerized christmas card, and that great[CR]staple of every traditional christmas, gambling games. The card section allows[CR]you to choose from three different backgrounds, three songs, and you can type[CR]in your own scrolling message, and even redraw the walking Santa to whatever[CR]you want. Basically, this offers you 10 to 20 minutes of semi-enjoyable time[CR]killing. Sadly, this is the pinnacle of fun for the game. The gambling, or[CR]"Party Games" as they're called, require basically no skill whatsoever to[CR]play. You hit A, and the cards fall as they may. You have a Slot Machine,[CR]Roulette Wheel, some strange Bingo game, and a dice game I can't comprehend.[CR]All of these games are hard as hell, too; I think ol' Santa's got his casino[CR]rigged.

    <plot>Alright. First things first. This is not a Seiken Densetsu ("Secret of Mana")[CR]game. Yes, it says Seiken in the title, but that does not make it Seiken[CR]Densetsu. Okay, now that I've gotten that out of the way... Seiken Psycho[CR]Calibur is a Zelda clone for the Famicom Disk System (Hence, you need Famtasia[CR]or fwNes to emulate this game). It's your classic over-head view hack and[CR]slash adventure. It's pretty decent, but it lacks the character of Zelda. And[CR]it tries so hard to be like Zelda, too. The play mechanics are like Zelda, the[CR]enemies seem like something out of Zelda, even the screen scrolls EXACTLY like[CR]it does in Zelda. But the plot isn't that very interesting ... there's no[CR]hook. Sure, there's this Demon-thing trying to take over the country. But the[CR]situation doesn't seem all that desperate, and the side quests just don't have[CR]much to draw you into the game. Where's my MOTIVATION, dammit!?!? But, my[CR]opinion is being swayed by the likes of Final Fantasy IX and Shen Mue, so it[CR]may be a bit loaded right now. No. It IS a bit loaded. There's definitely no[CR]maybe involved.[CR]Read Me:[CR]-- seiken psycho calibur --[CR]a[CR]translation by toma[CR]-- tomas story about the game --[CR]this game was[CR]screaming it me! it said[CR]"i am not seiken densetsu! i want to be[CR]zelda![CR]gwah~!"[CR]so then i translated it.[CR]and its a famicom disk system game,[CR]so[CR]that makes it extra crunchy.[CR]-- version 1.0 --[CR]as far as i can[CR]tell, its 100% done.[CR]its my first fds translation and it took[CR]me about 2[CR]days to finish, although it[CR]looks like it would have taken[CR]longer.[CR]anyway, as far as i can tell its done[CR]and playable, so go play[CR]it.[CR]oh, and thanks to mo for helping me with[CR]the parts i couldnt get[CR]myself towards[CR]the end (actually about 10 minutes[CR]ago.)[CR]--disclaimer--[CR]toma and/or the spoony bard are not[CR]responsible[CR]for any misuse of the patch. enough said.</plot>

    <plot>Photon is an interesting idea for a game. The developers played Space Invaders[CR]one day, and they thought that it was fun that you could shoot upwards only.[CR]So naturally, they got together and coded an NES game just like Space[CR]Invaders! Except, they took out the bases. And the UFOs. And the aliens come[CR]at you one at a time, and they don't move in predictable patterns. And they[CR]made it so you could move along more than one axis. And they added a first-[CR]person dungeon to it, and even stole the graphics for it right out of the[CR]Ultima games. And they added pits. And they made it insanely easy to get lost[CR]unless you make a map with your trusty graph paper. So, I guess you end up[CR]with a game that isn't really like Space Invaders at all. Unless you count the[CR]upward shooting. That's still pretty fun.[CR]Read Me:[CR]Photon - The[CR]Ultimate Game on Planet Earth[CR]v1.00 beta[CR]January 8, 2003[CR]KingMike[CR]Translations[CR](http://www.emuxhaven.net/~kingmike/index.html)[CR]***********[CR]INTROUCTION[CR]***********[CR]Photon[CR]- The Ultimate Game on Planet Earth, known to the Japanese as Hikari no Senshi[CR]Foton, and the rest of the world as Foton - The Ultimate Game on Planet Earh,[CR]is a Famicom game released by Takara Co., Ltd. on August 28, 1987. In this[CR]game, you play as Photon, who has traveled to a mysterious dungeon in space.[CR]Why? We dont know. If anybody knows of an actual plot to this game, let me[CR]know.

    <plot>Did anyone ever play the original Spelunker? That really old game where you[CR]ran around in a cave and died if you fell four feet? Or if you ran into a[CR]smallish hill? Yeah, great game. Fortunately Spelunker 2 is a little bit[CR]better. This game introduces the concept of Health. Sure, you can fall from a[CR]ways and lose health, but it isn't as ridiculous as the first game. Sure, you[CR]can still lose health if you run into a smallish mound of dirt. Well, that's[CR]still stupid, I'll have to give you that. You can choose from three heroes in[CR]this game: the Explorer, the Priest, and the ESPer. I can't really tell the[CR]difference, but they have different items and stuff. Alls I know is, your[CR]Explorer's little knife is crap. You can stab and stab at those damned enemies[CR]and it won't help much. Like those stupid bees. DAMN THOSE BEES! But still,[CR]yeah, the game's pretty cool, if you can stand that sort of thing. Honestly[CR]though, those bees suck. And those boar things? They also suck. And all those[CR]indestructible zombies and ghosts and such? Okay, so maybe the game isn't as[CR]great as I thought.[CR]Read Me:[CR]Version 0.9[CR]This is the first public[CR]release of Sarysas Spelunker II Translation Patch. All the menus and messages[CR]have been translated. It should be mostly bug free, but it may contain a few[CR]errors with the text less important to the gameplay. Please email me at[CR]sarysa2@yahoo.com if you find any problems.[CR]Known Problems:[CR]- Theres[CR]supposed to be a way to continue using controller 2. (Id rather not spoil the[CR]games built in hint) I havent been able to get this to work, though. If anyone[CR]has any information about this, please let me know.[CR]Special Thanks:[CR]- To[CR]the makers of xchar, which I used to edit the graphics/fonts. Finally,[CR]something that works![CR]- To the makers of Hexpose and Thingy, both which I[CR]used to edit the text. (Thingy for the JP version, Hexpose to edit the ENG[CR]versions text)[CR]- To Irem Corp., if they still exist, for making this odd[CR]gem.[CR]- To Broderbund, whose licensing of the game allowed me to squeeze in[CR]"Translated by Sarysa" somewhere.[CR]- To the Monash Nihongo Archive, which[CR]has utilites that helped me learn...[CR]- To Geyla, for having the strangest[CR]name Ive ever seen on any RPG villain. (I almost went with Gila, Gayla, and[CR]Geela)[CR]Translation F.A.Q.[CR]Q: Why are you doing this?[CR]A: Im trying to[CR]learn Japanese, and I thought it would help to try and translate a simple[CR]game. Then I realized that translating a game written entirely in katakana is[CR]a nightmare. Still, most of my translation should be accurate, and all of the[CR]hints needed to complete the game are there.[CR]Q: Will you send me the ROM[CR]for this game?[CR]A: No. Find it on your own.[CR]Q: What is speleng.tbl?[CR]A:[CR]I conveniently included it for anyone who wants to use Hexpose to view/edit[CR]the text. Just dont write over anything in *. CR signifies a line break.[CR]Q:[CR]Whats with the heart meter?[CR]A: I changed a few things here and there. The[CR]life bars are now a zelda-like heart meter. I made up a few names for certain[CR]weapons. (changed Explorer and ESPers "knife" to "sword" and "rapier"[CR]respectively, gave ESPer specific secondary weapon names, changed "canned[CR]food" to "ration" and "clergyman" to "priest" for space reasons)[CR]Q: Will my[CR]save states of the Japanese original work?[CR]A: You mean, you played it[CR]BEFORE my translation? Seriously though, they will work, but you still wont be[CR]able to read anything.

    <plot>Yes, the bastard child of the Splatterhouse series. This is another one of[CR]those games that really doesn't take itself too seriously. Of course, that[CR]much is obvious from looking at the cute super-deformed protagonist. Even with[CR]an axe and a hockey mask, he still manages to be cute. And the whole game is[CR]just as silly. Well, not incredibly silly, but it's silly at various points.[CR]Anyway, you're a dead guy who's rescuing his girlfriend, and in doing so walks[CR]perpetually to the right, and cuts up all kinds of possessed objects and[CR]demons on the way to the pathetically easy showdown with the big pumpkin thing[CR]and the really cool ending. There's even a "Winners Don't Use Drugs" screen in[CR]the credits. How damned cool is that?[CR]Read Me:[CR] (insert elite[CR]ascii graphic here plz)[CR] SD Splatterhouse 2.00 (7 January 2000)[CR]Official Readme File![CR]--------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]I.[CR]Introduction[CR]II.

Legal stuff that would[CR]never hold up in[CR]court[CR]--------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Introduction[CR]SD Splatterhouse may well be the coolest side-scroller game[CR]ever. Of[CR]course you might not think that if you had to play through it over[CR]and[CR]over again to test out stuff. But hey, its good for a quick[CR]diversion.[CR]Youre a guy who came back from the dead, and youve got a hockey[CR]mask,[CR]and your girlfriend got kidnapped by some demon. As you can tell its[CR]an[CR]amazing plot that will quickly draw you in, but basically you swing an[CR]axe[CR]around and kill various things, and you get a shotgun in some[CR]places,[CR]which packs quite the punch. And yes, it recoils. Hows THAT for[CR]realism?[CR]Kids these days.. No one bitched about an Italian plumber[CR]eating[CR]mushrooms and doubling in height.. Now anything that isnt 3D sucks![CR]Bah![CR]--------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Project[CR]This translation can now be officially called "complete." Before,[CR]only the[CR]ending was translated. Now, everything is 100% english, including[CR]a killer[CR]title screen by Ballz.

This game will run just fine on[CR]any[CR]emulator that claims to support Mapper 19. Actually, there isnt[CR]one[CR]that fully supports it, but Famtasia comes closest. Anyway enough of[CR]my[CR]bitching about Megami Tensei 2. Ahem.[CR]Patching is simple.. You can[CR]use the easy way with SNES-Tool, or you can[CR]be a man like me and use[CR]IPS.EXE. Get the unpatched rom and the ips file,[CR]and then at the DOS[CR]command prompt type:[CR]IPS SPLATTER.NES SPLATTR2.IPS[CR]In case youre a[CR]complete idiot, you should substitute SPLATTER.NES for[CR]whatever the name of[CR]your rom is. Just be aware that IPS.EXE doesnt[CR]support long filenames.[CR]Anyway, now youre all set to play. Hopefully[CR]something as easy as this[CR]needs no explanation. BioNES makes a[CR]SPLATTER.NMC file when you run it, but[CR]Ill be damned if I know what it[CR]does, since the game uses[CR]passwords.[CR]--------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Thanks![CR]Big thanks to Xeur, who took the time out of his study schedule[CR]to[CR] translate this stuff! And look, I actually finished it![CR]Thanks to[CR]Sardius. This translation is entirely dedicated to him and his[CR] niftiness.[CR]I forgot to mention that in the last readme.

I doubt I[CR]forgot anyone[CR]though.[CR]--------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Legal Made-Up Stuff[CR]What are you doing with the SD Splatterhouse rom if you[CR]dont own the[CR]cart?! Shame on you! Dont you know that Nintendo of America is[CR]going to[CR]hunt you down and get a search warrant to be able to legally[CR]search your[CR]computer for copies of games that were never released outside[CR]of Japan and[CR]which cant be legally sold to anyone since the sale of used[CR]games is[CR]prohibited and Famicom games went out of production years ago? And[CR]even if[CR]you DO own the cart, and (naturally) dumped the rom yourself, dont[CR]even[CR]THINK about applying this IPS patch to it, since thats a violation[CR]of[CR]copyright. Why the hell did you download this thing anyway? Im afraid[CR]Im[CR]going to have to take you downtown sir. Yes, thats right! Im actually[CR]an[CR]IDSA operative, and Ive planted a beacon in this zip file! Whenever[CR]you[CR]open this zip, the beacon will send me your name, address,[CR]telephone[CR]number, PIN number, and all that pr0n you have! Oh, you do have a[CR]lot of[CR]it, dont you?

    <plot>Sugoro Quest is a genre-bender of a game. It's an RPG, but yet it has many[CR]board game elements. It may sound like a strange combination, but it works[CR]surprisingly well. It almost comes off as a tabletop RPG simulation. The back-[CR]story is fairly simple. The Kingdom of Siland is plagued with various[CR]problems, all of which involve monsters living in caves wreaking havoc on the[CR]countryside.

Some squares have multiple exits, and the one you[CR]end up using depends on which character you are, or how you answer a certain[CR]question. Any square without an event leads to a battle. Battle is a bit[CR]different compared to most NES role-playing games. You face monsters one-on-[CR]one, and each side rolls a die. The side that rolls the higher number gets a[CR]number of attack equal to the difference between the die rolls. So if you roll[CR]a four and the monster rolls a two, you get two attacks.

    <plot>Sugoro Quest is a genre-bender of a game. It's an RPG, but yet it has many[CR]board game elements. It may sound like a strange combination, but it works[CR]surprisingly well. It almost comes off as a tabletop RPG simulation. The back-[CR]story is fairly simple. The Kingdom of Siland is plagued with various[CR]problems, all of which involve monsters living in caves wreaking havoc on the[CR]countryside.

I know sometimes the[CR] screen[CR]wont scroll far enough to allow you to access warp points.[CR] That is a bug[CR]in the original, and in some places may have even been[CR]intentional.[CR]*********************[CR]PATCHING[CR]INSTRUCTIONS[CR]*********************[CR] The ROM will need to be expanded[CR]with a program such as nflate first.[CR] Expand the PRG-ROM.[CR] Either apply[CR]the IPS version of the patch to an original Japanese ROM,[CR] or use a program[CR]such as upset (from byuu.org) to apply the UPS version.[CR] And I suppose you[CR]know not to apply it to a pre-patched ROM.[CR] This translation was tested on[CR]the 1986 version of the ROM, but looking[CR] at the differences between the[CR]two, it should be compatible with the 1990[CR] ROM as well. (technically, the[CR]only visible difference seems to be the[CR] date on the title screen. The[CR]mapper code was also changed slightly.[CR] My guess is the 1986 version ran on[CR]a PCB with bus conflicts and the 1990[CR] version did not. The 1990 version[CR]also contains a small additional routine[CR] that doesnt appear to serve any[CR]useful function: it reads from some address[CR] like $4420 that is believed to[CR]be unmapped and then follows with a branch[CR] with a relative offset of 0[CR](which again appears to be a useless[CR]instruction).[CR]****************[CR]EMULATION ISSUES[CR]****************[CR]Not aware of any. Again, the bugs I am aware of were present in the[CR]original game and may have even been intentional.[CR]*****************[CR]PLAY[CR]INSTRUCTIONS[CR]*****************[CR]Controls:[CR] Note this is a 1-player[CR]game but does utilize the mic on the FC second controller.[CR] D-Pad[CR] Move.[CR]Hold Down and press B to jump very high.[CR] Push Up to talk to people.[CR]Select[CR] Open the Information Screen[CR] Start[CR] Pause[CR] B Button[CR]Jump, cancel selections on menus[CR] A Button[CR] Attack, confirm selections[CR]on menus[CR] Second Controller[CR] This game does use the microphone found on[CR]the Famicom Player 2 controller.[CR] Additionally:[CR] Down + A (on Controller[CR]II): Activate silent input.

    <plot>At first glance, this may just appear to be a neat little Space Harrier-type[CR]game, but actually it turns out to be a really cool neat little Space Harrier-[CR]type game. I know the screenshots are kind of confusing and don't really show[CR]much, but it really has to be seen to be appreciated.. Some of the effects are[CR]just incredible, especially for the NES. Not much to be said about the[CR]gameplay, really.. You fly around and shoot stuff. However, the tricky part is[CR]that you also have to dodge all the stuff that might kill you. That's the part[CR]that most people have trouble with, anyway. I don't know, maybe it's more[CR]complicated than that, but I never bothered to find out. I just kept hitting[CR]the B button.

However[CR]some[CR]wary individuals joined a group called the "Resistance" which worked to[CR]prepare mankind[CR]against a possible betrayal by the Baal.

Then in [CR]2091 the betrayal[CR]came and the Baal turned from helping Earth to trying to destroying it.[CR]Immediately you, the test pilot of the Tetrastar project, must return as[CR]you stand as mans [CR]only chance at survival... [CR]About the[CR]Project[CR]-----------------[CR]Well, one day (maybe a couple of months ago) I[CR]was reading through posts on ZDs romhacking[CR]board. I saw an unanswered post[CR]by |tsr about a translation request for a Famicom shooter[CR]called Tetrastar.[CR]Knowing he was well-versed in all things Famicom I tried the game out,[CR]looked at the text, and decided Id do it. I contacted tsr| wondering if he[CR]wanted to do the[CR]translation. Fortunately he was and graciously translated[CR]the script I sent. But he noticed[CR]that this was only half of the script. I[CR]went back into the rom and low and behold I had[CR]missed the second half of[CR]the script located after a large banks of FFs. Eventually I the[CR]entire[CR]script was translated by him and I got to hacking it back in. Well heres the[CR]finished [CR]project enjoy.[CR]Now one more point. I dont take requests at[CR]all. In fact if you ask me directly Ill [CR]be more inclined to avoid it than[CR]even look at it. So no requests. The only ones I consider[CR]are ones posted[CR]in a general forum that have some intelligence behind them. I dont[CR]translate[CR]games because they fall into this or that adored theme (such as[CR]Dragon Ballz or something [CR]along those lines). Gameplay and story are the[CR]elements Im looking for. So any direct [CR]requests to me will be[CR]ignored.[CR]Thanks[CR]------[CR]-Everyone at CTC for their support[CR]-My Beta[CR]Playtesters:[CR] The MadHacker[CR] |tsr[CR] [cx][CR]-My tools: Script[CR]Extractor (by Jair), Hex Workshop, Tile Layer, BioNes, and SNEStool[CR]Visit[CR]Gaijin Productions at:[CR]http://gaijin.romhacking.com[CR]Also visit the[CR]Confederated Translation Company, of which Gaijin Productions is a[CR]member:[CR]http://ctc.weyland-yutani.net/</plot>

    <plot>Oh, no! On the way to meet your girlfriend Haruka, our intrepid little hero has gotten ambushed by that nefarious, time-traveling villain, Professor Time. Now it's time to join him as he crosses time and space to save her from his evil clutches.[CR]In this run and jump action game, you'll find yourself flung anywhere from prehistoric times to the far future and back again, defeating anything from dinosaurs to samurai to aliens just to get her back.[CR]Your main weapon -- your ever-sturdy baseball cap. Just toss it forward and let it simply boomerang back or jump as it boomerangs back to let it fly around you for a short amount of time. And if you're lucky enough to collect enough chimes, you'll get to witness the awesome destructive power and invincibility of the skateboard.[CR]Combined that with a host of hazardous obstacles so prevalent in platformers and you've got yourself into quite a pickle trying to tackle Professor Time. Pursue and flog him with your cap so that the hero and Haruka can live happily ever after.</plot>

    <plot>If you're thinking about playing this game, don't. I usually try not to say[CR]anything terribly bad about non-DBZ games on the site, because the people who[CR]translated it (usually) put a lot of effort into it. However, this game is[CR]just bad. You are a large, 8pixel x 16 pixel red, white, and blue blob that[CR]can be Optimus Prime, or Inferno. I'm not really sure. And there's lot's of[CR]stuff zipping around the screen, and it all shoots at you, and it all can kill[CR]you in one hit. You hear the same damn song through the whole game. Many of[CR]the levels are palette swaps of the previous level. THREE of the bosses you'll[CR]fight are nothing more than a giant Decepticon symbol. (Yes, kids. Before[CR]there were Predicons, there were Decepticons. And they'd kick the Predicons'[CR]asses in). But the best part is, if you're patient enough to play this game[CR]for more than five minutes, there's some kind of an infinite loop in Stage 9.[CR]You get to the end ... and instead of fighting a boss (which is probably just[CR]another giant Decepticon symbol), you get whisked back to the beginning of the[CR]stage. Kinda remniscient of many old Atari games that never end. Anyway, play[CR]this horrible, horrible game at your own risk.[CR]Read Me:[CR]Transformers[CR]- Mystery of Comvoy[CR]v1.00 [CR](7 November 2000)[CR]No Talent Translations -[CR]http://www.geocities.com/rokarumbaba/translation/[CR]NOTICE!! This translation[CR]only works well in certain emulators.. [CR]I dont know why, as Im not an[CR]emulator author. I do know that [CR]it works in the latest versions of JNES,[CR]Famtasia, and NESticle [CR](as of the time of this[CR]writing).[CR]--------------------[CR]Members[CR]--------------------[CR]-[CR]Klarth (kefka_5000@hotmail.com)[CR]--------------------[CR]I.

Legal Crap[CR]--------------------[CR]--------------------[CR]I.[CR]The Game[CR]--------------------[CR]- You are Optimus Prime, fighting against[CR]the evil Decepticons [CR]to .. uh .. do something. Unfortunately for the fate[CR]of the[CR]universe, you die. Continuosly. There is no mercy for you, no[CR]hit points.. only death. And when you finally do get past the [CR]first[CR]side scrolling part, youll ask yourself "what the hell [CR]am I supposed to do[CR]to this ball thing that keeps shooting out [CR]little flying things." But you[CR]shall never know, because the [CR]programmers never added anything else into[CR]the game. You[CR]simply die again, know that its "more than meets the eye,"[CR]and listen to that catchy little "Game Over" tune. Kind of[CR]reminds me[CR]of Ninja Gaiden in that respect, except you could[CR]FREAKING WIN NINJA[CR]GAIDEN!!!!! *cough* And then you die.[CR]--------------------[CR]II. Project[CR]History[CR]--------------------[CR]- I was discussing my other crappy[CR]"translations" that Id[CR]done, when TheRedEye mentioned a crappy title hack[CR]translation[CR]for Transformers - Convoy no Nazo. So after searching[CR]around[CR]for it, I found it on Zophars Domain (the only site with[CR]permission to host it).. it was done by a group called "The[CR]Elite[CR]Hacking Force" (who have since temporarily quit so that[CR]they can improve on[CR]their hacking skills). ZD lists the title[CR]of the translation as[CR]"Transformers: Mystery of Ultra Magnus [CR](a.k.a. Transformers: The Mystery[CR]of Fire Convoy)" .. it only[CR]took me a moment to decide that the game was[CR]impossible enough,[CR]had little enough to translate (read: title screen), and[CR]was[CR]actually pretty cool to play. (Did I mention that you die?) So[CR]I[CR]decided that the game qualified to be a No Talent translation[CR]project, and[CR]I sat down and "translated" the title screen.[CR]People, please realize that[CR]the name of the game is [CR]Transformers - Comvoy no Nazo (which translates to[CR]Transformers [CR]- Mystery of Comvoy), not Convoy no Nazo .. where the Elite[CR]Hacking Force got Mystery of Fire Convoy from, I do not know.[CR]- THINGS[CR]TO NOTE!!!! [CR]1) This translation only works well in certain[CR]emulators..[CR]I dont know why, as Im not an emulator author. I [CR]do know that it works in[CR]the latest versions of JNES, Famtasia, [CR]and NESticle (as of the time of[CR]this writing).[CR]2) I may remove the "No Talent Translations Proudly[CR]Presents"[CR]at a later time, or change it to read "Transformers - Comvoy no[CR]Nazo" or something. For now, I think it doesnt look too[CR]bad.[CR]--------------------[CR]III. Completed[CR]--------------------[CR]- To[CR]the best of my knowledge, everything.[CR]--------------------[CR]IV.[CR]Incomplete[CR]--------------------[CR]- Nothing, hopefully. May make the title[CR]screen prettier [CR]sometime, though.[CR]--------------------[CR]V.[CR]Thanks[CR]--------------------[CR]- TheRedEye, for making me decide to take on[CR]this project.[CR]- The Elite Hacking Force, for making me think that this[CR]needed[CR]to be done.[CR]- The Whirlpool (http://donut.parodius.com), RPGd[CR](http://rpgd.emulationworld.com), and all the other[CR]cool[CR]translation/emulation sites I regularly[CR]visit.[CR]--------------------[CR]VI.

    <plot>Not really familiar with the manga etc., but basically the game is split up[CR]into sections like infant, elementary school, high school etc. What you have[CR]to is climb your way to the top of the building and grab on to a flying[CR]jellyfish or something to progress to next stage where Lum becomes. You also[CR]have a time limit in the form of flames that continually rise below you. So[CR]you have to get to the top before the flames consume you.

    <plot>The Adventures of Bayou Billy is one of the most notorious NES games for being[CR]almost impossible to beat. As such the game can be considered broken and/or[CR]not enjoyable.

    <plot>Konami Wai Wai World is an action game for the Nintendo Entertainment System.[CR]The game is a mashup of Konami game franchises and characters. The main[CR]characters, Konami Man and Konami Lady, are original characters for the game,[CR]but makes special appearances in other Konami games. Characters included as[CR]playable characters are Goemon from the Goemon series, Simon from the[CR]Castlevania series, Moai from the Gradius series (not to be confused with[CR]Moai-kun where that game was released 2 years after this game), Fuuma from[CR]Getsu Fuuma Den, Mikey from The Goonies game, and Kong from King Kong 2 game.[CR]Its gameplay is more of Castlevania in terms of platforming. It also has a[CR]vertical shooting stage featuring TwinBee and Gradius.[CR]Read[CR]Me:[CR]###################################[CR]# #[CR]# Konami World English[CR]#[CR]# VRC beta compliment Translation #[CR]# By Demi for Y0SHi #[CR]#[CR]12/16/97 #[CR]# demi@frognet.net #[CR]#[CR]#[CR]###################################[CR]"The translation is essentially[CR]the product of 2 days of boredom and a[CR] smattering of wewetata[CR]pmk."[CR]-----------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]NEW[CR]IN THIS VERSION:[CR]VRC - Im told a new version of nesticle is coming out[CR]soon, and[CR] it may support the original VRC mapper konami world was[CR]meant[CR] for. so, i copied the CHR and text banks to the NEZ file and[CR]here it is. there are no improvements from version 3. lelelele[CR]3.00 -[CR]changed character ciman to spice (it fits better with[CR] cinnamon) [CR]extended getsufuu-maden to its full name[CR] fixed spices reincarnation text[CR] added a line or two of spices reincarnation dialogue [CR] added the bad[CR]card text in the card game[CR] drew in the later! text graphic[CR] translated[CR]kongs hey! cage message[CR]2.00 - fixed the dice game dialogue. in 1.00, i had[CR]really no idea [CR] what they were trying to say (the game is a complete[CR]nigger[CR] to translate) so i just threw in some confusing nonsense.[CR]1.00 -[CR]initial release. about 80% complete, although i will need[CR] sardu to fix a[CR]few bugs in the mapper emulation to be able[CR] to see all of the game, so its[CR]not all done[CR]yet.[CR]-----------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]This documentation will probably never be passed around with the intended[CR]ROM after one or two couriers through the emu scene, so ill try to make[CR] it[CR]as pointless as possible for your spontaneous arousal.[CR] [CR] i started work[CR]on the evening of the 19th, and by the evening of the [CR] 20th (right now) im[CR]about 80% thru. ill release it when its all good [CR] and done. the[CR]translation was done 100% by me, Mr. 1 year of college [CR] Japanese, so dont[CR]bother sending me bug reports about how it isnt [CR] entirely accurate. its[CR]pretty late right now, and ive been working [CR] on it all day. Hey! i got a[CR]good idea. if anyone can guess what font[CR] i stole to build this ones, ill[CR]mail you a circuis peanut, or something..[CR] depends what i find.. no[CR]promises..[CR] [CR] this morning, i had set out to make it as fluent as[CR]possible, but as [CR] the hours wore on, my inevitable freakish sense of humor[CR]found its way [CR] into the translation, and so you people now have a slightly[CR]messed up [CR] translation where people curse at you, and generally give you[CR]an [CR] uninspiring message in whole towards your goal (not to mention the[CR] subtle use of a few shmooze points here and there). [CR] [CR] oh! i[CR]almost forgot. dont even think of trying to use the password [CR] function.[CR]the password uses the japanese alphabet, which has more [CR] symbols in it[CR]than english does. so, youll get some normal looking[CR] letters in your[CR]password, and some really fucked looking ones. but,[CR] chances are youre[CR]using a capable enough emulator that allows real-time[CR] saves, so it[CR]shouldnt be a problem.[CR]-----------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]APPLICATION:[CR]to apply the patch, you need to have a trained NES format rom [CR] which is[CR]262160 bytes long. if your japanese konami world rom isnt[CR] 262160 bytes,[CR]then youve got problems. just run the apply batch[CR] program with the[CR]contents of this archive and the japanese rom both[CR] in the same directory[CR]and itll patch it lickety split. [CR]-----------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]CONTROLS:[CR]there are a few points you should know that arent entirely obvious[CR] when[CR]you play the game. jumping and punching are the normal A and B,[CR] but then[CR]you have these few:[CR] DOWN ... press to go into 1 of the 3 doors in the[CR]beginning[CR] (not up like youd expect, eh)[CR] [CR] UP ... press up to go[CR]into the little doors within the levels[CR] that lead to betting games.[CR]DOWN + B ... press when on a teleporter to warp back to the base.[CR] also,[CR]press down + B to open a cage door and release[CR] an ally when you have a[CR]key.[CR] UP + A ... press to switch characters while in a level.[CR] DOWN + A[CR]... press to switch from normal attack to item attack[CR] (if your current[CR]character has an item to[CR]utilize)[CR]-----------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]STORY:[CR] the storys pretty cool, actually. as with games like parodius, konami[CR]felt it needed to parody itself a bit to keep its audiences entertained.[CR]So, they created this game which contains characters from multiple other[CR]previously released konami games, excluding the central characters konami[CR]man (who did a camio in goonies 2) and konami girl. [CR] Dr. Cinnamon cries[CR]for help, as the enemy forces from planet Gradius are[CR] trying to take over[CR]Konami World! not only have they succeeded in making[CR] him hysterically mad[CR](he swears at you a lot :) but they have immobilized[CR] the only 6 forces[CR]capable enough to defeat them! [CR] quickly, Konami man jumps into the action.[CR]Along with the android, Konami[CR] Girl, that Cinnamon provides, they set off[CR]to rescue the 6 allies and[CR] reclaim their Konami[CR]World![CR]-----------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]GAMEPLAY:[CR] the gameplay is pretty much like a konami megaman. for every level that[CR] you complete, you find one character, and are able to use his[CR]abilities[CR] till the end of the game. the last level is a shooter level,[CR]where you [CR] can choose to be twinbee or vic viper. along with the[CR]characters you can[CR] find, there exist harder to reach items that make the[CR]game a little bit [CR] more interesting to play, and often times make the[CR]character a little more[CR] valuable. they are:[CR] Konami Man[CR] Relation:[CR](None)[CR] Item: Beam Gun[CR] your normal gun-type thing. no surprises.[CR]Abilities: Flying Cape[CR] Konami Girl[CR] Relation: (None)[CR] Item: Heat[CR]Gun[CR] same kind of thing as Konami Mans, basically..[CR] Abilities:[CR]None[CR](use konami man and girl only as last resorts or if you have noone[CR]else,[CR] as they have no real distinguishing features and their musics[CR]suck!)[CR] Goemon [CR] Relation: Goemon, Doraemon (I think eh)[CR] Item: No[CR]Fucking Clue [CR] Abilities: He can open the flashing treasure boxes.[CR]Simon Belmont[CR] Relation: The Castlevania Series[CR] Item: Holy Cross[CR]Like a boomerang type thing. One of the best projectiles, but[CR] it takes[CR]away 5 bullets every time you use it.[CR] Abilities: Effective against[CR]vampires and undead.[CR] Gestu Fuu-Maden[CR] Game: Getsu Fuu-Maden (unreleased[CR]in USA)[CR] Item: No Fucking Clue[CR] Abilities: A Special Hadouken mastery[CR]enables him to have a higher[CR] number of enemy items stolen.

Im off to bed... [9-13-2000][CR]Version .15 [2150 bytes][CR]*The version that started maiming Akujins translation* - Unreleased[CR] I had[CR]to move stuff around, and I added some more letters and scrunched[CR] names.[CR]Oh, the intro dialogue is in!

It turns[CR] out that the Konami programmers used certain codes that I[CR]could not touch[CR] under any circumstances, else the title would go to hell.[CR]So I used only the[CR] parts that were not protected. The result? Well, go and[CR]play it for yourself,[CR] youll see. *grin* Also, I nearly used all of the[CR]tiles in the block for that[CR] title screen. Makes me wonder how do they do[CR]those titles anyway, its hard o.o[CR] That title screen is an adaptation of[CR]Prezs original concept, which was way[CR] cooler. It had a swirly circle[CR]behind the title. Anyway, that title proved to[CR] be impossible to implement,[CR]in part because of the control codes in the game,[CR] and in part due to Prez[CR]needing more tiles that the game had available.[CR] Anyway, Prez couldnt do[CR]the title screen because of personal conflicts, but[CR] I still appreciate him[CR]designing the title for me. If it wasnt for him, this[CR] would never have[CR]been completed fully! ^_^[CR]April 11-12, 2001[CR] Edited the remaining parts.[CR]Except the title screen. But its done... finally[CR] done![CR]September 29 and[CR]30, 2000[CR] Its done! If only someone would come and vanquish those parts Im[CR]missing...[CR]September 15, 2000[CR] Got the Minibosses CD! ^_^ Yah, I know...[CR]cant a guy brag? ;D[CR]September 14, 2000[CR] Gah! I started all over again so[CR]I could use some tiles I had ignored,[CR] and now I have 20 more tiles to use![CR]^^;;;;;;;; Thanks to Translhextion, I[CR] quickly transferred the dialogue[CR]from one version to the other, with just a[CR] simple script[CR]dump![CR]September 13, 2000[CR] Moved stuff around, and accidentally deleted[CR]the new graphic for the map =P[CR]August 30, 2000[CR] Partial script dumps[CR]have been made [the introduction, the song names and the[CR] sound names].[CR]Unfortunately, the rest of the script is spread out within the[CR] rom at[CR]random. So the remaining parts will have to be translated using[CR]screenshots [Ack!

His attack is[CR]a straight[CR] shot, that doesnt travel very far away from him. Hes the only[CR]one who can[CR] die by losing all his hearts.[CR]Ishikawa Goemon [The guy with[CR]the black hair][CR] Special Ability - Pipe Boomerang Attack[CR] From: Legend[CR]Of The Mystical Ninja / Mr.Goemon / Ganbare Goemon[CR] He attacks by throwing[CR]his pipe. However, when he throws it, it flies back[CR] towards him! It can[CR]hit anyone or anything even when it is flying back at[CR] you! ^^ Pretty[CR]useful! It flies very far too![CR]Upa [The Baby][CR] Special Ability - Cloud[CR]Maker[CR] From: Bio Miracle Boku tte Upa![CR] When he [she? :|] hits an enemy,[CR]he [she?] turns him into a cloud, which he[CR] [she?] can use to climb to[CR]higher places. Oh, and his [her?] size allows him[CR] [her?] to fit in small[CR]places [I think]. Oh, he [she?] must attack very[CR] closely to the enemy. Upa[CR]is also the only one that can swim.[CR] [CR]Simon Belmont [The guy in the[CR]upper right corner][CR] Special Ability - The Vampire Killer [the whip][CR]From: Akumajou Densetsu / Castlevania III: Draculas Curse[CR] Uh... Ive got no[CR]clue as to what can he do. Actually, he has very good[CR] attacking distance,[CR]but like the old Castlevania games, he can only use the[CR] Vampire Killer[CR][the whip] towards his front.[CR]Bill Riser [The blond guy][CR] Special[CR]Ability - 4-way Machine Gun [^^][CR] From: Contra / Gryzor[CR] Ha! Now this[CR]guy really rocks! Its player one from Contra, in SD form! He[CR] can shoot in[CR]four directions [up, right, down, and left] when hes jumping.[CR] Sorry folks,[CR]no diagonals in this game [&gt;_&lt;]. His bullets reach all the way[CR] to the end[CR]of the screen. Good attack power, as well.[CR]Fuuma [The guy with the red[CR]hair][CR] Special Ability - The Hadouken blade[CR] From: Getsu-Fuuma Den[CR]The best attack power in the entire game! His attack covers his entire[CR]front[CR] and part of his head. But you have to be really close to the enemy[CR]to hit it.[CR] The good thing is, that most regular enemies die with just one[CR]slash. So[CR] he has a distinct advantage over the rest of the[CR]characters.[CR]------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]6[CR]- What tools did you use on this[CR]project?[CR]------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Translhextion 1.5 and 1.6 [http://januschan.romhacking.com/] [CR] - Script[CR]dumper, editor, re-inserter and optimizer[CR] Tile Layer .50b[CR] Tile Layer[CR]Pro 1.0 [http://snowbro.romhacking.com/][CR] - Graphic editing[CR] Microsoft[CR]Notepad [CR] - Table maker[CR] Macromedia Fireworks 1[Full] and 3[Demo][CR] -[CR]Gif images and basic image editing[CR] Famtasia Ver5.1 [CR] - Game testing[CR]platform[CR] Rocknes 1.2 [http://rocknes.emuviews.com][CR] - Game testing[CR]platform[CR] NESten 0.6 Beta Final [http://tnse.zophar.net/] [CR] - Game[CR]testing platform[CR] JWPce[CR][http://www.physics.ucla.edu/~grosenth/jwpce.html][CR] - Japanese dictionary,[CR]japanese table maker and script dump editing[CR] NJStar Communicator[CR][http://www.njstar.com/][CR] - Kanji/kana table insertion[CR] Comptons[CR]Interactive Encyclopedia [1996 Edition][CR] - Has one hell of a thesaurus...[CR]^_^[CR] Caffeine [CR] - ENERGY!!!!!! *walks like a[CR]Zombie*[CR]------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]7[CR]- So... what emulators can run[CR]this?[CR]------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]- Unofficial Nester (by TAKEDA, Toshiya)[CR] - Rocknes (By Fx3 -[CR]Discontinued).[CR] - Famtasia Ver 5.10.[CR] I apologize to Mac OS/Linux/BeOS/[CR]or other Os users, I only have Windows 98[CR] and DOS.

    <plot>Sanrio Carnival is just a hodge-podge of various puzzle games, such as[CR]"falling candy of doom," and "rearrange the picture" (better known to some as[CR]"Columns," and "Major Annoyance"). But, it throws in all those loveable Sanrio[CR]characters, which makes up for it being a mediocre game. Playing against the[CR]computer is entirely boring. However, finding another human player may inject[CR]some added fun. But then again, finding another person to play Nitendo is a[CR]game unto itself :-P[CR]Read Me:[CR] ______ ____ __ __ ______ _______[CR]______ [CR] | _____| / __ \ | \ | | | _ | |__ __| | __ |[CR] | |____ | |__| |[CR]| \ | | | |_| | | | | | | |[CR] |____ | | | | | | |\ \| | | _| | | | | | |[CR]____| | | | | | | | \ | | |\ \ __| |__ | |__| |[CR] |______| |_| |_| |__|[CR]\\___| |__| \\_\ |_______| |______|[CR] CCCCC A RRRRRRR N N IIIIIII V V A[CR]L[CR]C A A R R N N N I I I V V A A L[CR]C A A R R N N N I V V A A L[CR]C[CR]AAAAAAAAA RRRRRRR N N N I V V AAAAAAAAA L[CR]C A A R R N N N I V V A A L[CR]C[CR]A A R R N N N I I I V V A A L[CR] CCCCC A A R R N N IIIIIII V A A LLLLLL[CR]_______ _______[CR] |__ __| |__ __|[CR] | | | | [CR] | | | |[CR] __| |__ __|[CR]|__[CR] |_______| |_______|[CR] [CR] Sanrio Carnival 2[CR] English to[CR]Japanese[CR] Translation[CR] v. 1.00[CR] [CR]-------------------------------[CR]DEDICATION -------------------------------[CR] [CR] This translation is[CR]dedicated to my ex-gf Jacqueline who bought me the[CR] laptop that I used to[CR]complete the translation after being computerless[CR] for 8 months.

Closing[CR]------------------------------ INTRODUCTION[CR]-----------------------------[CR] Following in the tradition of most of the[CR]other Sanrio games, Sanrio[CR] Carnival 2 takes a well known theme and[CR]improves upon it greatly. This[CR] is a puzzle game, along the lines of Tetris[CR]or Columns, and includes[CR] three different modes.[CR] The first is the[CR]standard "get enough matches so you can advance[CR] to the next level" game.[CR]After each level, you play one of those games[CR] where you slide the tiles[CR]around trying to put them back order. The[CR] second mode is battle mode where[CR]you and the computer compete to get[CR] a certain number of matches while[CR]trying to blow each other up with[CR] bombs. In the third mode, you just try[CR]to get as many matches as you[CR] can until there are no more possible matches[CR]left. There is also a 2[CR] player mode which lets you compete against someone[CR]else in battle mode.[CR]-------------------------------- HISTORY[CR]--------------------------------[CR] v. 1.00 - August 13, 2000[CR] Whats[CR]Complete[CR] - all text translated (I believe.)[CR] - minor graphics hacks[CR](Title and Ending Screens)[CR] Whats Incomplete[CR] - nothing that Im aware[CR]of[CR]--------------------------------- STAFF[CR]---------------------------------[CR] Hacking and Translating - InVerse -[CR]http://www.pigtails.net/ST[CR] This was the first project that I did entirely[CR]on my own.

You need[CR]three things. A ROM,[CR] the patch and a patching program. To patch with IPS,[CR]you simply[CR] type "ips  ". So if the name of the ROM was[CR] Tabo.nes you[CR]would type "ips Tabo.nes Tabo.ips" and your ROM is now[CR] in English. Make[CR]sure you have all the files in the same directory[CR] if you have a[CR]problem.[CR] To patch a ROM with SNES Tool, simply select USE IPS, choose[CR]the patch and then choose the ROM to affix the patch to. Its self[CR]explanatory. If you cant figure it out, the game is probably too[CR] hard for[CR]you anywayz.[CR]--------------------------- CONTACT INFORMATION[CR]-------------------------[CR] The official Tabos Tactics home page is[CR]currently located[CR] at http://www.pigtails.net/ST[CR] E-Mail addresses[CR]concerning the project can be located on the [CR] official[CR]page.[CR]--------------------------------- CLOSING[CR]-------------------------------[CR] So there you have it.

    <plot>This is a board game that stars five Mega Man characters: Dr. Light, Dr. Wily,[CR]Dr. Cossack, Roll, and Kalinka, Dr. Cossack's daughter. From what I[CR]understand, up to four players can choose one of those characters and play a[CR]board game, which seems similar in setup to Monopoly. It also appears to have[CR]some mini-games, but I couldn't find any.

    <plot>This is a board game that stars five Mega Man characters: Dr. Light, Dr. Wily,[CR]Dr. Cossack, Roll, and Kalinka, Dr. Cossack's daughter.

This project is not [CR]affiliated with Nintendo[CR]or dB-Soft. This translation[CR]is not for sale and was not made for[CR]profit.[CR]-----------------------------[CR]Patching---------------------[CR]-----------------------------[CR]Apply[CR]the included .IPS patch to a Woody Poko NES/famicom[CR]ROM image using Snes-[CR]Tool or some other IPS patching[CR]tool.[CR]-----------------------------[CR]Woody[CR]Poko-------------------[CR]-----------------------------[CR] This game is an[CR]early famicom title (1987) made by [CR]dB-SOFT, who Ive never heard of. Its an[CR]adventure game [CR]with platforming and RPG elements. You collect items[CR]and[CR]money, go to shops, get information, and progress through[CR]four or[CR]five levels.[CR] That said, the game is a little confusing. The hints[CR]are[CR]sometimes vague, and youre sometimes expected to find[CR]hidden holes which[CR]only appear if you walk over them.[CR]The control doesnt always make sense.[CR]For example, when[CR]you first go to a shop, you might end up stealing an[CR]item[CR]by accident and being branded a thief for the rest of the [CR]game.[CR]Unless you are in one of the last levels, being[CR]branded a thief pretty much[CR]spells the end of your quest[CR]since you cant really use the shops[CR]anymore.[CR] Overall the game is pretty mediocre. You can have fun[CR]with it,[CR]and it was probably a good game when it was [CR]released, considering its[CR]era.[CR]-----------------------------[CR]Gameplay[CR]Issues--------------[CR]-----------------------------[CR] I dont think there[CR]are any problems in the gameplay[CR]stemming from the translation hack[CR]itself.[CR]-----------------------------[CR]Translation[CR]Commentary-------[CR]-----------------------------[CR] First of all, the game[CR]had only a hiragana alphabet,[CR]so besides the normal obstacles in[CR]translating an NES game[CR]lacking kanji, the script was now even more[CR]confusing than[CR]usual.[CR] There were a few lines that i wasnt happy with,[CR]but[CR]they did not come up in game, so I really dont know how[CR]to gather[CR]the context to better translate them.[CR] There was a series of dialogue[CR]mentioning ingredients[CR]for some kind of recipe that involved fetching one[CR]or two[CR]things. I couldnt find this in the game, and it mentioned[CR]getting[CR]a bee, which i didnt find in the game, either.[CR]Pointers exist for this text[CR]in the ROM, but I dont know[CR]whether its ever actually used.[CR] If a lot of[CR]the "hints" you pay and trade items for[CR]seem useless or confusing, thats[CR]because they generally[CR]are. The guy who asks for money seems particularly[CR]useless[CR]in general, while the girl who asks for items is more hit[CR]or[CR]miss.[CR] Speaking of that useless guy asking you for money all[CR]the time,[CR]some of his lines were kind of confusing. I[CR]dont know if they were puns or[CR]word plays or something.[CR] One other line i didnt understand was this[CR]one:[CR]aa3a"a(r)aa-aaaaa- aaaaaaaaPSa|a[CR]I think it means [CR]"a dwarf said[CR]a hannsu or something was coming." [CR]The intent seems to be to allude to[CR]something that sounds[CR]like hannsu in Japanese, but Im completely in the[CR]dark.[CR]I also dont know who the heck this dwarf is.[CR] The ending mentions[CR]an old man named Matsumura. Perhaps[CR]the games manual mentioned who this[CR]Matsumura was, since[CR]the name appears nowhere else in the entire script. I[CR]can[CR]only assume that the old man refers to the guy Poko speaks[CR]to in the[CR]first stages opening dialogue.[CR] Speaking of that opening, it seemed Poko[CR]had awoke[CR]from a nightmare involving wooden dolls. I wasnt sure[CR]this[CR]would make very much sense, so I changed it to a [CR]Jason reference.[CR] And[CR]speaking of that ending, i have no idea what the[CR]"Bunny Dance" is all[CR]about.[CR] This translation could probably use some work, since[CR]its my[CR]first translation hack and second script[CR]translation. I hope for my[CR]Japanese to improve in the[CR]future, so I might come back to it to make[CR]things better.[CR]However, I think its more than adequate as it[CR]stands.[CR]-----------------------------[CR]Tools[CR]Used-------------------[CR]-----------------------------[CR]FCEUXDSP[CR]Hexposure[CR]XVI32[CR]hex editor[CR]Paint[CR]Tile Layer Pro[CR]yy-[CR]chr[CR]Cartographer[CR]Atlas[CR]Notepad[CR]Wordpad[CR]NJStar[CR]http://www.jisho.org[CR]-----------------------------[CR]Special[CR]Thanks---------------[CR]-----------------------------[CR]GilGalad - helping[CR]me with a lot of general questions [CR]regarding ROM translations, and for[CR]helping me with [CR]utilities.[CR]SliverX - helping me with some PPU[CR]hacking/debugging[CR]#arc-nova.org on DarkMyst.org - Pretty much the only[CR]ROM[CR]hacking related community i frequent.</plot>

    <plot>Gal's Dungeon: Yakyuuken Part II is an adventure game for the Family Computer[CR]Disk System. The game was released in Japan only.[CR]Read Me:[CR](insert elite ascii graphic here)[CR] Gals Dungeon (18 October 2008)[CR]Official Readme[CR]File![CR]------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]I.[CR]Introduction[CR]II. Project[CR]IIa. Project Members[CR]IIb. Tools[CR]IIc.[CR]History[CR]III. End-User Information[CR]IV. Thx[CR]V. Legal stuff that would[CR]never hold up in[CR]court[CR]------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Introduction[CR]Gals Dungeon is an unlicensed Famicom Disk System game by[CR]Super Pig. This, of[CR]course, means that youre gonna see some 8-bit titties[CR]at some point.[CR]You play as private eye Kogorou Kurachi, tasked with[CR]rescuing the daughter of[CR]a crime syndicate boss from the mysterious[CR]"Phantom of 40 Faces". Its a 3D[CR]dungeon game, similar to the mazes in[CR]Wizardry and other terrible computer[CR]RPGs, where you progress through eight[CR]floors of the villains master hideout[CR]to the thrilling final[CR]showdown![CR]Each floor has a female guardian, whom you must play rock-paper-[CR]scissors[CR]against. If you win, you get the key to the next floor. You can[CR]pick up maps[CR]and compasses to guide your way, but always be wary for hidden[CR]traps and[CR]secret clues![CR]Kogorou Kurachi is the designers little parody[CR]of the Japanese fictional[CR]detective Kogoro Akechi, often considered the[CR]Japanese counterpart to Sherlock[CR]Holmes. His most frequent nemesis was the[CR]master criminal, the Fiend with[CR]Twenty Faces. So theres some history for[CR]you.[CR]Gals Dungeon is a pretty fun game, and you can really see that the[CR]designers[CR]tried branching out beyond their usual crap games. Its short,[CR]which is a big[CR]plus, however its very easy with savestates. But, most games[CR]are.[CR]------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Project[CR]I intended to start work on the game right after it was first[CR]released in[CR]November 2006. But, I... didnt, and kind of forgot about it[CR]until March 2008.[CR]Then I worked on it off and on for a period of months,[CR]until today. Its not[CR]that it was particularly hard, but Gals Dungeon wasnt[CR]exactly my highest[CR]priority, you[CR]understand.[CR]Members:[CR]--------[CR]Spinner 8[CR](http://donut.parodius.com)[CR] - text hacking[CR]Shih Tzu[CR](http://www.flammie.net/vse/)[CR] - text translation[CR]Beckey (?)[CR] -[CR]graphic design[CR] [CR]Tools used:[CR]-----------[CR]Microsoft Windows XP by[CR]Microsoft Corp.[CR] (http://www.microsoft.com)[CR]FCE Ultra Extended Debugger[CR]SP (FCEUXDSP) 1.07 by Bero, Xodnizel, Parasyte,[CR] BBitmaster, and sp[CR](http://www.the-interweb.com/serendipity/)[CR]Tile Layer Pro 1.1 by Kent[CR]Hansen[CR]YY-CHR 0.98-02 by Yy[CR](http://www.briansemu.com/yymarioed/)[CR]WindHex for Windows 2005.4.20 by[CR]Bongo`[CR] (http://stealth.romhack.net/)[CR]romjuice 2.2 by prez[CR]FDS[CR]Builder 2/6/05 by KingMike[CR] (http://kingmike.emuxhaven.net/)[CR]Snes-Tool[CR]1.2 by the M.C.A and Elite[CR] [CR]Patch history![CR]--------------[CR]Version[CR]1.00 - All text translated, title graphic changed. Assorted graphical[CR]changes that dont really[CR]matter.[CR]------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]End-User[CR]When the FDS format was first announced and released, Famicom Disk[CR]System[CR]images required a 16-byte header. However, that headers[CR]completely[CR]unnecessary, since the only real information stored in it is how[CR]many sides[CR]the disk has, something anyone with a brain can see just from[CR]looking at the[CR]filesize. Gals Dungeon was originally released without this[CR]header, as are[CR]most FDS images these days. Therefore, your game image must[CR]NOT have a header[CR]when patching. Make sure your image is exactly 131,000[CR]bytes, or this patch[CR]will absolutely not work.[CR]Since theres no such[CR]program as GoodFDS, people arent running around with[CR]full FDS ROM sets, so[CR]finding this game (especially such a recently released[CR]game) may be[CR]difficult. Its listed in the No-Intro database as "Yakyuuken[CR]Part II - Gals[CR]Dungeon (Japan) (Unl)" currently, so thatll be something for[CR]you kids to[CR]look for.[CR]At this point, a tutorial for how to use IPS patches isnt really[CR]necessary,[CR]what with all the fancy patching programs people have these[CR]days. Go to[CR]http://zerosoft.zophar.net/ipswin.htm for an IPS patcher if you[CR]need one. Its[CR]really easy,[CR]ok.[CR]------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Thanks![CR]This translation is dedicated to Yuki, who dumped and released this[CR]game along[CR]with countless other FDS releases and redumps, many of them[CR]previously[CR]unreleased and very rare. Thank you Yuki! Release more[CR]games![CR]Thanks to BMF54123 and KingMike, for some assembly help. BMF took a[CR]look at[CR]the ending for me (thanks!), and KingMike suggested a solution to[CR]an issue I[CR]was having with not enough space in the intro, which I wrote a[CR]routine for all[CR]by myself! My first ASM hack! However, in the end I changed[CR]my mind and cut[CR]the script down, and took the routine out.[CR]Whoops![CR]Thanks to Shih Tzu for the excellent translation, and for the[CR]timely responses[CR]to the questions I had. I know this isnt going to be[CR]really high on the list[CR]of awesome translations youre known for. But, it[CR]was done as more of a favor[CR]to me, and I appreciate it, my friend. I still[CR]remember that phone call back[CR]in 1999 where we talked about how annoying[CR]Precis is.[CR]Thanks to Bongo`, who made the absolutely excellent and[CR]completely useful[CR]WindHex hex editor program. Its like Thingy, only better[CR]in every way, which[CR]makes it pretty much perfect.[CR]Thanks to oddigy for[CR]the webspace, and for many other things. I still intend[CR]to come visit you[CR]someday.[CR]Thanks to Sardius, for support and testing. You actually found a[CR]bug! Awesome![CR]Thanks to Beckey, for not being totally disgusted with my[CR]love of emulation[CR]and ROM translations.[CR]------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Legal Made-up Stuff[CR]Even considering the fact that this is a patch for an[CR]game that was never[CR]licensed to run on the system it runs on, the legal[CR]status of ROM patches is[CR]still somewhat up in the air. These translations[CR]are only made out of the love[CR]for the games, and it is hoped that the[CR]copyright holders bear this is mind.[CR]Please feel free to redistribute this[CR]patch, so long as the readme (and only[CR]the readme) is distributed with it.</plot>

    <plot>In this game, the player takes the role of Adol Christin, a red-haired adventurer and expert swordsman. One day he encounter a fortune teller who sends him on a quest to find information about the six books of Ys. It appears that there was once an ancient land called Ys, whose secret was sealed in those six books. Before long Adol learns that the six books were all stolen by the evil wizard Dark Fact (Dulk Dekt in the Sega Master System version, Malificus in the English-language computer versions). It is Adol's task to defeat the villain and discover the secret of Ys![CR]Ys is an action role-playing game with its own trademark combat system: instead of pressing the "attack" button, the protagonist simply runs into the enemies he encounters. More damage is inflicted upon the enemies if Adol charges at them from the back or from the sides - a head-to-head collision might result in the hero's death if the monster is stronger than him. The player gains gold and experience points for defeating foes; once enough experience has been accumulated, Adol levels up and becomes stronger. The hero can buy and equip swords, armor, shields, and other accessories.</plot>

He did a fine job of blazing[CR]through the game and[CR] spotting quite a few bugs that have been ironed out.[CR]Also runs a[CR] darn good translation site along with Spinner 8.[CR]TheFreak -[CR]http://sgst.romhacking.com/[CR] Beta tester.

I[CR]thought itd be nice to do the sequel,[CR]since the first two games[CR]storylines tie very closely together. I knew of[CR]another group doing it,[CR]at http://members.xoom.com/ys_project/ but they[CR]hadnt updated in two[CR]years. I read about their problem, and thought I could[CR]help out. But[CR]a day or so after emailing them, it bounced back. So I just[CR]decided to[CR]take it on myself. I was fortunate that the text was encoded in[CR]the[CR]same style as Ys 1. It did take a little longer to finish than[CR]I[CR]expected, but that was no problem.[CR]I dont plan on doing any more Ys[CR]games, since the third part is[CR]already available on the SNES and Genesis[CR]consoles (I recommend the[CR]Genesis one, myself). And parts four and five are[CR]being taken care of.[CR]If you ever get the chance, be sure to play the Turbo[CR]Duo version of[CR]Ys Book I-II. Although its quite old, its still an excellent[CR]classic.[CR]============[CR]Instructions[CR]============[CR]The file[CR]"ys2e.ips" must be patched to the original ROM image to play[CR]this[CR]translation. Any IPS patching utility should work. Two commonly[CR]used[CR]utilities are IPS.exe and Snestool. You can find these two[CR]programs at most[CR]emulation websites.[CR]*** Always keep a backup of the original ROM image.[CR]***[CR]To use IPS.exe, run this at a command prompt:[CR]IPS  [CR]Snestool has[CR]a graphic interface that makes it easier. After starting[CR]it, select "Use[CR]IPS", then select the IPS file, then the ROM image[CR]that it should be used[CR]on.[CR]This game has been tested with the NESten and Nesticle emulators.[CR]If[CR]the game shows jerkiness or flashing, try tweaking the[CR]timing[CR]settings.[CR]==========[CR]DISCLAIMER[CR]==========[CR]Ys 2 is[CR](c)1988 Nihon Falcom. This work is unofficial and is not[CR]supported by[CR]them.[CR]This patch may be freely distributed, as long as:[CR] - The patch[CR]remains unmodified[CR] - This readme file accompanies the patch[CR] - The ROM[CR]image is not distributed with this patch already applied[CR]This patch is not[CR]for sale, and is not to be exchanged for money,[CR]goods, or services of any[CR]kind.[CR]I wont be held accountable for any damage or undesirable side-[CR]effects[CR]this patch may create.
