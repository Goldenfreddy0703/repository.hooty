		<emu_comment>NGPC list.  Filtered to remove duplicates, betas, etc.[CR]The Neo Geo Pocket Color (shortened NGPC), is a 16-bit colour handheld video game console manufactured by SNK. It is a successor to SNK's monochrome Neo Geo Pocket handheld which debuted in 1998 in Japan. The Neo Geo Pocket Color was released on March 16, 1999 in Japan, August 6, 1999 in North America, and some time in 1999 in Europe. The Neo Geo Pocket Color was SNK's last video game console, and is backwards compatible with the Neo Geo Pocket. In 2000, following SNK's purchase by American pachinko manufacturer Aruze, the Neo Geo Pocket Color was dropped from both the North American and European markets. It did, however, last until 2001 in Japan, with a total of 2 million units sold.[CR]Developer:  SNK[CR]CPU:  Toshiba TLCS900H core (16-bit), 6.144 MHz, Z80 at 3.072 MHz for sound[CR]Memory:  12 k for 900H, 4k for Z80 (shared with the 900H)[CR]Graphics:  160x152 (256x256 virtual screen)[CR]Sound:  SN76489 variant, T6W28 (3 square wave tone generators with limited stereo capability plus 1 monaural noise generator plus direct access to the two 6 bits DAC)[CR]Display:  16 palettes per plane, 48 palettes. 146 colors on screen out of 4096 (or 20 colors out of 4096 in monochrome mode)[CR]Media:  Cartridge[CR]Max Controllers:  1</emu_comment>

		<plot>Crush Roller is a game for the Neo Geo Pocket Color based on the 1981 arcade game Make Trax, which was released as Crush Roller in Europe and Asia.[CR]The object of the game is to color the entire maze-like playing field with a paint brush. While you paint, two enemies walk around in the maze, when they hit you, you lose a life.[CR]A level has rollers which you can push forward with your paint brush. If you capture an enemy in the path of the roller he dies and is temporarily taken out of the game. This scores you extra points. Each subsequent enemy rolled over is worth more points.[CR]Every once in a while another creature will pop up, it will run around leaving behind track marks in your paint. Painting over this creature removes it from the game and scores you additional points. His tracks have to be repainted.[CR]When the entire maze is painted you win the level. Unlike the original arcade version the Neo Geo Pocket Color version has multiple levels.</plot>

		<plot>Dive Alert: Becky's Version is an RPG for the Neo Geo Pocket Color. There is another version of Dive Alert called Dive Alert: Matt's Version. The two games are rather like joint Pokemon releases (Red/Blue, etc) wherein they are overall the same game with a variety of smaller differences.[CR]The player takes control of a character named Becky. The game takes place in the future and the world is primarily surrounded by water. The only land is a small patch called Terra. The player must prove their worth to be accepted on to Terra by proving their skill as a submarine commander and destroying enemy vessels.[CR]Becky's version features different characters, items and boats from Matt's Version. These are logged in a device similar to a Pokdex (from Pokemon). Battles take place against enemy ships and a radar view is used to help the player guide torpedoes towards the enemy vessels. Much of the game is text-based with animated cutscenes. [CR]The game features the ability for two players to link up Neo Geo Pocket Color units to exchanges ships and data, and to battle one on one.  The game also features battery back-up and a training mode.</plot>

		<title_clean>Evolution - Eternal Dungeons</title_clean>
		<plot>A portable version of Evolution: The World of Sacred Device. Eternal Dungeon tells the story of the young explorer Mag Launcher and his quest for the fabled Evolutia, an item of immense power.[CR]The basic premise of the game is to take quests in the town and then assemble your party and attempt to clear out the many dungeons in the game, grinding your characters and getting the loot and experience needed to advance the plot and buy items, equipment, and upgrades for your Cy-frame, a robotic attachment that enables Mag to enhance his combat abilities.[CR]As expected for a portable version, the gameplay has been significantly downgraded from its original Dreamcast version. Town navigation is menu-driven and all graphics are now top-down 2D sprites, with all dungeons being pre-designed instead of randomly generated. Combat is turn-based using a menu system from which you select your actions for each party member (up to 3) and execute them, but otherwise remains unchanged.[CR]https://www.mobygames.com/game/neo-geo-pocket-color/evolution-eternal-dungeon[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] New enemy formation in battle.[CR]After going into a battle, if you turn off your system, turn it back on, and then restart from previous game; the enemies you fight, in what position they appear, and how many there are changes.  This helps when you'd like an easier battle, just continue to restart the battle until you're satisfied.</plot>

		<title_clean>Fantastic Night Dreams Cotton</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Fantastic Night Dreams: Cotton is a shoot 'em up and is the first in a series of games starring the titular character, Cotton. Featuring entertaining cutscenes (in some versions these are voiced, as well!) it had a relatively well developed story in terms of shoot 'em ups for the era.[CR]Developed by Success Corp., Cotton was originally released in the Arcades by Sega in 1991. It was ported to the PC Engine CD-ROM2 in 1993 where it was given a whole new redbook audio soundtrack. This version was ported to the US later the same year. It was also ported to the Sharp X68000 Japanese home computer that year as well. Later versions would hit the Neo Geo Pocket Color and the PS1: Cotton Original, the PS1 version, uses the soundtrack of the TurboGrafx-CD version and the graphics of the original Arcade game, making it a "best of both worlds" edition of the game.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Silk the fairy acts as an "option" for Cotton and follows and attacks with her; Cotton can get additional fairies. Cotton also has two types of shots, a basic forward magical attack and magical "bombs", resembling bubbles she drops at an angle in front of her. Various types of magic serve as Cotton's powerful special attacks; these are limited by the number you have in stock.Items[CR]Most power ups take the form of gems (houseki) dropped by enemies; these can be shot by Cotton to change their color and consequently the effect they have when picked up. Larger gems are (of course) worth more of whatever the particular color grants. Most special items (like the fairy stones and bomb power ups) are carried by strange statues seen throughout the game. Don't destroy their heads when they leave the screen; they'll come back holding a power up!GemsA medium yellow gem. Yellow: Yellow gems are worth bonus points.Orange: Orange gems grant Cotton experience, powering up her weapons.Red: Gives Cotton one or more red magic stocks.Blue: Gives Cotton a blue magic stock.Other ItemsA bomb level up. Bomb level up 1: Levels up Cotton's bombs by one.Bomb level up 2: Levels up Cotton's bombs by two.Fairy Stone: Gives Cotton an extra fairy familiar in addition to Silk!White Tea: Only found at the bonus segment after a boss is defeated. Worth 100 points.Red Tea: Also only found at the bonus segment after a boss is defeated. Worth 500 points.Magic SpellsFire Dragon: Cotton fires a dragon made of fire straight forward. This costs a stock of red magic.Thunder: Cotton fires a powerful lightning bolt straight forward which remains active for some time. This costs a stock of blue magic.Fire Silk: Silk and any other fairies you have are engulfed in fire and charge at the enemies. This costs a stock of red magic.Barrier: Temporarily protects Cotton from enemy projectiles. This costs a stock of blue magic.Special Attack: All of Cotton's fairies attack the enemies. This is performed only when you have no magic stocks.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]A wave of darkness from the world of monsters has tainted the light prism which brings light and happiness to the land of fairies; on top of that, the only thing that can restore the prism are seven magical candies called willows... which happen to have been stolen by the strongest of the monsters! Silk is sent by the fairy queen to find help, but all she manages to find is a strange, air-headed and mildly insane witch named Cotton. Silk uses Cotton's obsession with candy to trick her in to retrieving all the willows and restoring light to the fairy kingdom; throughout the game she frequently has to prevent Cotton from eating the willows.[CR][B]Stages:[/B][CR]Stage 1.Stage 1: A ruined town. Cotton travels over a lake at night, a baleful moon glowering down upon the land. The stage mini-boss is a giant stone head; the boss is ALSO a stone head with multiple faces, called a "face idol".Stage 2: A forest. Cotton encounters a tree mini-boss in this stage; the stage boss is called "Death".Stage 3: A dark and scary mountain. There is a flaming hound as a mini-boss; the stage boss is a giant snake woman called Medusa.Stage 4: A dark temple. The mini-boss is a monstrous plant; the boss is a giant, multi-stage statue called Sphinx.Stage 5: A castle of monsters! A pair of giant crabs are a mini-boss here. The boss is a terrifying plant-man growing in to the castle itself.Stage 6: A subterranean volcano. The mini-boss is a pair of demons; the boss is a terrible dragon.Stage 7: A battle with the final boss, a demon lady who is the leader of the monsters. She wants to eat all the willows herself! Will Cotton finally get to eat the willows? Or will Silk successfully deliver them to the queen and have light restored to the land of fairies? Find out![CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Unlocking the Cutscenes[CR]Everytime you start a new level and beat the game, there are cutscenes explaining more of the story.  Everytime you see a new cutscene they become unlocked in the option menu (under Visual) so you can view them anytime you want.</plot>

		<title_clean>Faselei!</title_clean>
		<plot>Faselei! is one of the last titles to be released for the Neo Geo Pocket Color and even features digitised lyrics to the game's main theme. Heavily story driven, this strategy RPG takes place in a time when mechs known as TS are the weapon of choice for combat. Gameplay revolves around the battles and customising your TS between those battles.[CR]Battles are part turn based and part realtime. The player inputs their actions at the beginning of the turn. The amount of actions they can input is dependant on their type of TS. Once they have finished their selection everything is played out in realtime for the duration of the turn. This makes thinking about what your opponents and allies will do in advance essential before taking your turn.</plot>

		<plot>In this unique game you keep watch on the wacky Neo Poke-kun, a cartoony programmer...thing that lives locked in his small Tokyo apartment. You don't have direct control of his actions but instead interact with him indirectly by switching stuff in his apartment on and off, which triggers different reactions from him. More importantly you can invite different characters to visit Neo Poke-kun, which will also trigger different reactions from him. Depending on the time of day and the visitor you may get different reactions from Poke-kun, and if you make him happy enough he'll get to work and code a mini-game for you.[CR]These collection of 30 games form the bulk of the gameplay, and include different clones of other games, shooters, short platformers, and compact puzzle challenges similar to Wario Ware[CR]The game has a distinctly bizarre sense of humor with tons of wacky animations played whenever something happens to your Poke-kun, and while some games use basic vector graphics, most use 2D sprites.</plot>

		<plot>A port of the successful 2D fighter Last Blade for the NeoGeo Pocket Color. The port features nearly all the characters featured in the original game clashing against each other using a limited color palette and a new super-deformed character design, but otherwise identically as in their arcade counterpart. You select your character from a selection of swordsmen and then proceed to fight and defeat all your opponents in a one-on-one fighting tournament involving weapon fighting a la Samurai Shodown.[CR]Unique to the port is the fact that it allows you to unlock and play as characters from Last Blade 2 and in fact eventually unlock the full storyline for the sequel, making the game sort of a compilation of both released games in the series.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Play in Last Blade 1 mode[CR]When you first play through the game, you play through the game in the Last Blade 1 Story and character order.  Once you complete everything, everything turns into Last Blade 2 Story and character order. [CR]To go back to Last Blade 1 Mode, select one of the original 9 characters with the option button (instead of the A button)</plot>

		<title_clean>Metal Slug - 1st Mission</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B]Metal Slug 1st Mission was the first handheld iteration in the Metal Slug franchise.[CR]Metal Slug 1st Mission was released for the Neo Geo Pocket Color by SNK (it was developed by Ukiyotei Company). It was released on May 27, 1999 in Japan and in 2000 in North America. Naturally, the game has graphics altered for the handheld. There are only a few differences in gameplay from previous iterations in the Metal Slug franchise, such as the option button that switches between the grenade and fire buttons (as opposed to different buttons for each). There is only one playable character at the beginning (Marco Rossi), but after beating it once, another character is unlocked.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]The game takes place in 2027 A.D. There is rising trouble in relation to illegal arms dealing. After investigation, it is found that such weapons are being dealt by the Government Forces. This brings the threat into a more realistic perspective, as the location where weapons are being distributed is much larger and more advanced (with weaponry such as the SV-000 METAL SLUG prototype). The commander of this operation is none other than Colonel Hilde Garn and Lieutenant Colonel Macba. To deal with the situation, the Special Forces Squad Peregrine Falcons are sent in. The point of the game is to destroy the center and capture the men behind it.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Access Mission 13 &amp; Mission 14[CR]Crash your Slug Flyer in Mission 10 - ''Night Flight''. You need to finish the Parachute Mini-game after the crash to go to Mission 13 - ''Invasion in the Sea of Trees''. Complete Mission 13 to play Mission 14 - ''Weapons Port''.</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B]Metal Slug 2nd Mission improves on 1st Mission in a variety of ways.[CR]Metal Slug 2nd Mission was released for the Neo Geo Pocket Color on March 9, 2000. The game was published by SNK Playmore and published by Ukiyotei Company. Metal Slug 2nd Mission was very similar in gameplay to Metal Slug 1st Mission, but had various refinements. Graphics and controls were among some of the improvements. If the player beats the game once, then the playable character Tequilla is unlocked.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]The first mission of the Special Forces Squad Peregrine Falcons (which took place in Metal Slug 1st Mission) was a success, but it has faded into history. However, new information comes to the Government Forces relating to a rebel army led by Lieutenant Colonel Macba. The army, Special Strike Force Phantom, has began war against the Government Forces, even going so far as to take some of their own soldiers hostage. The threat becomes even more real when it is revealed that the enemy forces are working in collaboration with aliens, vastly increasing the technology and weapons of their forces. It is up to the Special Forces Squad Peregrine Falcons to put an end to the threat.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Unlimited Grenades[CR]To have unlimited grenades, rescue all of the hostages. Then hold down while selecting a character to have unlimited grenades.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Unlock Tequila[CR]Complete the game on any difficulty setting and Tequila will be unlocked to play as.</plot>

		<title_clean>Neo Geo Cup '98 Plus</title_clean>
		<plot>The Game Boy may have Fifa 2000, but the Neo Geo Pocket has Neo Geo Cup 98. It is basically a football game with the ultimate objective of winning the so-called Neo Geo Cup. Neo Geo Cup includes several modes. These are:[CR]Single match: Play a single match against the computer with any two teams.[CR]2 Player: A standard two-player game, using another NGP and link cable. Again use any two teams.[CR]Story: The main part of the game. Choose a team and play through the cup with them, earning money by winning, which can be used to buy equipment. The equipment improves your player's skills to help in your quest for the cup.[CR]Story mode is the best part of the game. It is hard to win at first but you earn some money for every match you play, whether you win or not, so after a few seasons your team is capable of winning. I managed to win the cup after five seasons, which may sound a lot, but its not that much as there are no more than six matches per "season". Also, if you don't have much time the game can be saved between matches, which lets you build up a great team. After building up your team you can challenge a friend against the team they have built up, on their Neo Geo. It is also possible to trade items with a friend via the link cable.[CR]Story mode is improved by random events like a trader that turns up to sell rare items or a scientist that improves your items. Bad things can also happen, like a thief that steals your hard-earned items or your star player falling ill. You do have a chance of fixing your bad luck, by choosing where to look for the thief or which medicine to give your player, one will make him better, though one makes him worse.[CR]You may think the actual football may struggle with just two buttons but it is done very well. With the ball one button shoots and the other passes, how long you hold the button affects the strength of the kick. When the opposition has the ball A is light tackle and B a hard, sliding tackle, which risks a booking. If the ball is in the air the buttons attempt to trap or header the ball. It may seem hard at first, but after a few games you will become better at it, and eventually capable of perfectly timing a volley into the goal after a cross in.[CR]One of the weaknesses of Neo Geo Cup 98 is the teams. It only has sixteen international teams from all over the world, though unfortunately it doesn't include Scotland :(. Because this game lacks an official licence, the players don't have real names. The England squad includes Shiringham, Hince and Patty and the worlds best footballer is called Ranamdo. This doesn't detract too much from the game, though and you accept it after a while, also if you're playing the more obscure teams you've probably never heard of the real players anyway.[CR]Anther weakness is the limited options. All matches are six minutes long (plus extra time and penalties) in perfect weather. The inability to adjust the match length is annoying as you need nearly ten minutes (allowing for stoppage time, extra time etc.) to finish a match.[CR]Two great strengths of this game are the graphics and sound. The game is played from a close up, top down view which lets you see the players running, kicking and passing beautifully. You can even see the players faces as they are tripped up, which is very funny. Whenever a goal is scored or a player is booked a screen is shown to represent the event, and a sound is played like "Nice shot" or "Oh no". The rest of the sound is good like the referee's whistle and the kicking noises. The music is also good and gets you playing faster. As well as in music during the match, music accompanies the other events during the game, like when the trader arrives oriental music is played.[CR]Overall - 84%[CR]Recommended if you like football. The graphics and sound are impressive, but the lack of options is restricting. This means that it can get repetitive, once you have built up a good team and mastered the game, as you can win just about every game easily.[CR]Reviewer: Craig[CR]http://www.neogeo.org.uk/reviews/neogeocup98.htm[CR]</plot>

		<title_clean>Neo Turf Masters</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Neo Turf Masters is a golf simulation game released in 1996 for the Neo Geo. Known as Big Tournament Golf in Japan, the game was developed by Nazca and published by SNK Playmore. This was the first of two titles that Nazca developed before being acquired by SNK Playmore in 1996 (discounting titles developed while they were still a part of Irem).[CR]The game was released on a variety of other systems after its initial release on the Neo Geo, including arcade, Neo Geo Pocket Color (in 1999), and the Virtual Console (in 2008). Neo Turf Masters was released for both MVS and AES Neo Geo systems, as well as the Neo Geo CD. Neo Turf Masters was also included in SNK Arcade Classics Vol. 1.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game's six available golfers.[CR]As far as golf simulation games go, Neo Turf Masters is fairly similar to the traditional offering. The player has four different courses to play on, located in a few international locations: Germany, Japan, USA, and Australia. Each course has 18 holes, naturally, totaling 72 holes of golf. In the arcade version of the game, one coin yields three holes, but successful play is rewarded with more holes, while poor performance results in a reduction of the holes left.[CR]The player has control over aiming the golfer, adjusting for wind, and then teeing off. Each swing also has a power meter, traditionally found in golfing games, which controls the arc of the swing and the power behind it.Golfers[CR]Each of the game's six playable golfers are given a title and a nationality.George Spinner (American, "Young Hero")Thomas Stewart (British, "Technician")Frank Adams (Australian, "Veteran")Robert Landolt (German, "Shot Maker")Fernand Almeida (Brazilian, "Power Golfer")Toyoshiege Takeno (Japanese, "Putt Master")[CR]</plot>

		<title_clean>Pac-Man</title_clean>
		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]An important icon of arcade gaming[CR]Originally titled Puck Man, Pac-Man hit the arcade scene first in Japan when Namco released it on May 22, 1980. Shortly after receiving a lukewarm response, the game was released in the U.S. by Midway. Compared to other arcade hits in the early '80s, such as Space Invaders, Galaxian, Defender, and Asteroids, Pac-Man put a friendlier face on its bizarre action and thus had the ability to appeal to a much broader audience. Toru Iwatani has said that he was looking for a way to attract women into arcades, which at the time were almost exclusively male locations. Having discarded ideas for a fashion based game and a love simulator, he had a eureka moment after a meal with his girlfriend. He noticed she ate a lot of dessert. Iwatani realized then that eating was a universal concept which he could exploit in a game.[CR]The game was considered a smash hit in the U.S. and spawned many sequels and spin-offs, including an animated television show (known as Pac-Man: The Animated Series), a breakfast cereal, and the song Pac-Man Fever by Buckner &amp; Garcia. Not to mention NFL star, Adam "Pac-Man" Jones, and eight-weight boxing champion, Manny "Pac-Man" Pacquaio.[CR]The original Pac-Man game was ported to various systems, including the Atari 2600, Atari 5200, NES, PC, Apple II, Game Boy, Game Boy Color, Game Boy Advance, Game Gear, Commodore 64, Atari 8-bit, Intellivision, MSX, NEC PC-6001, NEC PC-8801, FM-7, Sharp X1, Commodore VIC-20, ZX Spectrum, Neo Geo Pocket Color, mobile phones, iPhone, and iPod. The game was also released as an Xbox Live Arcade game under the Xbox Live Marketplace. That version was also included in the compilation disc Namco Museum: Virtual Arcade. The NES version was also re-released for the Game Boy Advance under its Classic NES Series program and for the Nintendo Wii in its Wii Virtual Console platform. The arcade version was re-released as a secret game under the Ms. Pac-Man and Galaga 20 Year Reunion cabinet (in the game selection screen, move the joystick up, up, up, down, down, down, left, right, left, right, left, and press both start buttons before inserting tokens). In celebration of the 25th anniversary of Pac-Man the cabinet was re-released with Pac-Man freely playable. The arcade version was also bundled with compilation discs such as Microsoft Return of Arcade, Microsoft Return of Arcade Anniversary Edition, Namco Museum Vol. 1 for the PlayStation, Namco Museum 64 for the Nintendo 64, Namco Museum for the Dreamcast, PlayStation 2, Xbox, and GameCube, Namco Museum: 50th Anniversary for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, and GameCube, Namco Museum DS for the Nintendo DS, Namco Museum Battle Collection for the PSP, and Namco Museum Essentials for the PlayStation Network (PS3).The infamous 2600 port of Pac-Man[CR]The Atari 2600 port is infamous for being considered one of the worst video games ever created. Having a very short development time frame and a very small staff, Pac-Man for 2600 wound up being a failed attempt at bringing an arcade classic home. Alongside E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial, it can be considered a major factor in the collapse of Atari, Inc. as well as the Video Game Crash of 1983.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Toru Iwatani, creator of Pac-Man[CR]The basic premise of the game involves the character, Pac-Man, a yellow circle with a slice cut out for a mouth. It's said by developer Toru Iwatani to represent a pizza with one missing slice as well as the general idea of a mouth eating. The player controls Pac-Man through a seemingly-endless amount of mazes, collecting pellets (or "dots") for points while avoiding the four ghosts (Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Clyde, each with their own unique movement patterns). If the player runs into any of the ghosts, the player loses a life. However, the player can run into a power pellet, which make the ghosts temporarily edible for points. This ability, which most players would consider fundamental to Pac-Man, was absent from the game until mid-way through development as Toru Iwatani and his team were fed up being constantly chased and decided to turn the tables on the ghosts.[CR]Players can also get bonus fruit pieces which show up at random intervals in each level. The primary goal is to maneuver around the level and eat up all the pellets without losing lives.[CR]Veterans of this game noticed patterns about the four ghosts and have developed movement patterns for each level that guarantee success. While hypothetically there is no ending to this game, level 256 is considered a kill screen. A bug in the routine on level 256 eliminates most of the pellets on the right side of the screen, replacing them and the maze with garbled text and graphics. It is impossible to clear that level legitimately. Because this level marks an end-point, the game can have a "perfect play" where the player achieves the maximum possible score on the first 255 levels without losing a single life and then scoring as many points as possible on the kill screen before losing all his lives. The maximum score possible in this game is 3,333,360 points. The first person to achieve this score was Billy Mitchell on July 3, 1999.[CR]Development[CR]The game was developed primarily by a young Namco employee named T&#333;ru Iwatani over the course of a year, beginning in April 1979, employing a nine-man team. It was based on the concept of eating, and the original Japanese title was Pakkuman (&#12497;&#12483;&#12463;&#12510;&#12531;), inspired by the Japanese onomatopoeic slang phrase paku-paku taberu (&#12497;&#12463;&#12497;&#12463;&#39135;&#12409;&#12427;), where paku-paku describes (the sound of) the mouth movement when widely opened and then closed in succession.[CR]Although Iwatani has repeatedly stated that the character's shape was inspired by a pizza missing a slice, he admitted in a 1986 interview that this was a half-truth and the character design also came from simplifying and rounding out the Japanese character for mouth, kuchi (&#21475;). Iwatani attempted to appeal to a wider audience&#8212;beyond the typical demographics of young boys and teenagers. His intention was to attract girls to arcades because he found there were very few games that were played by women at the time. This led him to add elements of a maze, as well as cute monster enemy characters. Eating to gain power, Iwatani has said, was a concept he borrowed from Popeye. The result was a game he named Puck Man as a reference to the main character's hockey puck shape.[CR]Later in 1980, the game was picked up for manufacture in the United States by Bally division Midway, which changed the game's name from Puck Man to Pac-Man in an effort to avoid vandalism. The cabinet artwork was also changed and the pace and level of difficulty increased to appeal to Western audiences.[CR]Impact and Legacy[CR]Immensely popular from its original release to the present day, Pac-Man is considered one of the classics of the medium, virtually synonymous with video games, and an icon of 1980s popular culture. Upon its release, the game &#8211; and subsequent Pac-Man derivatives &#8211; became a social phenomenon that sold a large amount of merchandise and also inspired, among other things, an animated television series and a top-ten hit single.[CR]When Pac-Man was released, the most popular arcade video games were space shooters, Space Invaders being the most popular. The most visible minority were sports games that were mostly derivatives of Pong. Pac-Man succeeded by creating a new genre and appealing to both genders. Pac-Man is often credited with being a landmark in video game history, and is among the most famous arcade games of all time. It is also one of the highest-grossing video games of all time, having generated more than $2.5 billion in quarters by the 1990s.[CR]When first launched in Japan by Namco in 1980, the game received a lukewarm response, as Space Invaders and other similar games were more popular at the time. However, the game found far more success in North America. Pac-Man&#8202;'&#8203;s success in North America took competitors and distributors completely by surprise in 1980. Marketing executives who saw Pac-Man at a trade show prior to release completely overlooked the game (along with the now classic Defender), while they looked to a racing car game called Rally-X as the game to outdo that year. The appeal of Pac-Man was such that the game caught on immediately with the public; it quickly became far more popular than anything seen in the game industry up to that point. Pac-Man outstripped Asteroids as the best-selling arcade game in North America, grossing over $1 billion in quarters in its first year, surpassing the revenues grossed by the highest-grossing filmStar Wars.[CR]It sold more than 350,000 arcade cabinets (retailing at around $2400 each) for $1 billion within 18 months (inflation adjusted: $2.86 billion in 2014). By 1982, the game had sold 400,000 arcade machines worldwide and an estimated 7 billion coins had been inserted into Pac-Man machines. In addition, United States revenues from Pac-Man licensed products (games, T-shirts, pop songs, wastepaper baskets, etc.) exceeded $1 billion (inflation adjusted: $2.86 billion in 2014). The game was also estimated to have had 30 million active players across the United States in 1982.[CR]Towards the end of the 20th century, the game's total gross in quarters had been estimated by Twin Galaxies at more than 10 billion quarters ($2.5 billion), making it the highest-grossing video game of all time (inflation adjusted: $7.16 billion in 2014). In January 1982, the game won the overall Best Commercial Arcade Game award at the 1981 Arcade Awards. In 2001, it was voted the greatest video game of all time by a Dixons poll in the UK.[CR]The game is regarded as one of the most influential video games of all time, for a number of reasons: its titular character was the first original gaming mascot, the game established the maze chase game genre, it demonstrated the potential of characters in video games, it opened gaming to female audiences, and it was gaming's first licensing success. In addition, it was the first video game to feature power-ups, and it is frequently credited as the first game to feature cut scenes, in the form of brief comical interludes about Pac-Man and the monsters chasing each other around during those interludes, though Space Invaders Part II employed a similar technique slightly earlier. Pac-Man is also credited for laying the foundations for the stealth game genre, as it emphasized avoiding enemies rather than fighting them, and had an influence on the early stealth game Metal Gear, where guards chase Solid Snake in a similar manner to Pac-Man when he is spotted.[CR]Pac-Man has also influenced many other games, ranging from the open-world sandbox game Grand Theft Auto (where the player runs over pedestrians and gets chased by police in a similar manner) to early first-person shooters such as MIDI Maze (which had similar maze-based gameplay and character designs). Game designer John Romero credited Pac-Man as the game that had the biggest influence on his career; Wolfenstein 3D was similar in level design and featured a Pac-Man level from a first-person perspective, while Doom had a similar emphasis on mazes, power-ups, killing monsters, and reaching the next level.[CR]</plot>

		<plot>Puzzle Bobble is a game that has appeared on just about every format ever and it's now available on the Neo Geo Pocket Color. The objective of this game is simple  fire bubbles up, match three together and they will disappear.[CR]The game includes several different modes. These are:[CR]Puzzle: Work through one hundred increasingly harder levels, clear the screen to move onto the next.[CR]Survivor: Keep going for as long as you can until the screen fills up, trying to get a high a score as possible. Points are given for every bubble popped, there are bonuses for clearing many at once or completely clearing the screen. Bubbles keep on appearing until you lose the game, speeding up steadily.[CR]Vs-CPU: Play against the computer to in a split screen, bubbles popped on one side move to the other. Both players keep going until either screen fills up. This mode features different characters to play against. The differences are not just graphical as each character plays on a different screen and at different speeds and "intelligence".[CR]Vs-Player: Like VS-CPU except you play against another human, instead of the CPU using another Neo Geo and a link cable.[CR]This game is great fun and it is perfect to big up for a quick go whenever you have a few minutes spare, on the bus, train or wherever. I play most of the modes quite often (except for Vs-Player as I have no friends with NGPs yet  they will be persuaded in due time). VS-CPU is best for quick blasts especially on the easier difficult levels  at the easiest you can win in less than a minute. Puzzle mode is also quick on the earlier levels, though the later levels can last quite a while. Survivor games can last a long time  I've played for over half an hour  so you need a fair bit of spare time if you want to do well without having to quit the game.[CR]Puzzle Bobble's graphics aren't brilliant though it is usually easy to see what's going on. The only problem I've had is the colours can look similar in dim light, which can be very annoying if it causes you to lose the game. The sound in this game is not great, though it is reasonable. It has nice happy music that isn't annoying, like in other games. The sound effects are fairly basic, with just sounds for the bubbles firing, popping and bouncing.[CR]Overall - 88%[CR]Though the graphics are simplistic, Puzzle Bobble Mini is a great puzzle game. It's perfect for whenever you have a few minutes spare, though it can get a bit repetitive. An essential purchase for puzzle fans and recommended for anyone else.[CR]Reviewer: Craig[CR]http://www.neogeo.org.uk/reviews/puzzlebobble.htm[CR]</plot>

		<plot>Puzzle Link is a game where blocks of matching color have to be dissolved. New blocks constantly scroll into the screen from the top. The game is over when the first blocks reach the bottom of the screen. You can dissolve blocks by shooting at them. The shots form a line where they impact. If that line connects otherwise unconnected blocks of the same color they will dissolve.[CR]There are three different modes: In "Normal" you have to link two special blocks that appear after some time. If you manage to finish the level within the time limit you will unlock one of 50 collectible cards. In "Clear Mode" you have to clear a given constellation of blocks. "Battle Mode" is a two player link-cable mode.</plot>

		<plot>The gameplay of Puzzle Link 2 is generally identical to the first game: Puzzle Link is a game where blocks of matching color have to be dissolved. New blocks constantly scroll into the screen from the top. The game is over when the first blocks reach the bottom of the screen. You can dissolve blocks by shooting at them. The shots form a line where they impact. If that line connects otherwise unconnected blocks of the same color they will dissolve.[CR]There are new modes in Puzzle Link 2. Like the original, there are the standard challenge and puzzle rounds. But new to the series is the marathon-style game where you continue eliminating pieces as the game gradually increases speed. In this mode, more power-ups appear as the player performs faster. Here, you get three shots that will eliminate the same color tile from the board. The game also has link cable support for two players.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Unlock "S" Course[CR]After completing all five courses (10, J, Q, K, A), a sixth course will become unlocked (S), containing rare cards.</plot>

It features ten of SNK's most popular heroines battling it out to become the first ever Queen of Fighters and win the K Talisman that can make any dream come true. This game is based on the same engine that powered other Neo Geo Pocket color fighters such as King of Fighters R-2 and SNK vs. Capcom: Match of the Millennium and as such bears a striking resemblence to them in terms of presentation and basic mechanics. The overall tone of the game is very light hearted and many aspects seem to have been specifically designed to appeal to females in an attempt to broaden the market of the struggling Neo Geo Pocket Color.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]It's the year 2000 A.D., the last year of the millenium, and female fighters the world over begin receiving invitations to the first ever Queen of Fighters (Q.O.F.) Tournament. The invitations are signed by a mysterious "Miss X" who promises the K Talisman, a priceless treasure with the ability to grant any single wish, as the grand prize for the competition's victor. And so, the world's greatest heroines come together to do battle in the hopes of making their dreams come true.[CR]Character Roster[CR]Starting Fighters[CR]Mai Shiranui - Fatal Fury 2[CR]Wish: "You know!

		<plot>Having been an avid Magic: the Gathering freak in my middle school years, I can safely say that Card Fighters 2 plays VERY closely to that most hallowed of collectible card games. If youve played the first Card Fighters game, its pretty much like that game, only with better animations, and interesting facts about the characters, and I can only assume more cards. People seem to like the card games, dont they?[CR]Translation Description:[CR]Card Fighters Clash 2 is a cool NeoGeo Pocket game, which has sadly only been released in Japanese. Since we like this game so much and since there is no chance of SNK releasing an English version of CFC2, we decided to start the translation ourselves.[CR]As of 5-03-08, all in-game text? (except the on-card flavor? text) is translated. There are some graphics that are still in Japanese. The card flavor text has not been translated yet.[CR]The flavor? text shown on each card is completely missing. This is because it has not been translated. If you would like to translate it, please contact us.[CR]The name entry screen (where you enter your name or your deck name) is imperfect.[CR]The status screens (when you save your game or when your get battle status) have graphical glitches.[CR]Reviewer: Spinner 8[CR]https://www.romhacking.net/trans/82/[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Hidden Characters in Free Battle Mode[CR]Once you've beaten the game and unlocked all the characters in Free Battle Mode, hold the "Option" button over the following to face 3 hidden boss characters.</plot>

		<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Sonic the Hedgehog: Pocket Adventure[CR]Sonic the Hedgehog: Pocket Adventure is the only Sonic the Hedgehog game released for the Neo Geo Pocket Color. It was released on December 3, 1999 in North America, and on January 11, 2000 in Japan. It was the second Sonic game to be released on a console not developed by Sega (the first being Sonic Jam for the Game.com). Sonic the Hedgehog: Pocket Adventure was developed by Dimps and Sonic Team, and published by SNK and Sega. Despite having very similar levels and gameplay as Sonic the Hedgehog 2, it contains arrangements of music from Sonic the Hedgehog 3 &amp; Knuckles.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Sonic the Hedgehog: Pocket Adventure has the same traditional gameplay that most other Sonic games have. The gameplay is similar to that of the original three Sonic games, but the art style is more representative of the Sonic Advance games. During the game, there are several zones that the player must navigate (each with a boss).[CR]Sonic the Hedgehog: Pocket Adventure also has a multiplayer mode for up to two players. Each player must have a Neo Geo Pocket Color, a copy of the game, as well as a link cable. The multiplayer game is known as Duel Mode, with two different modes: Sonic Rush and Get the Rings. Sonic Rush has the two players racing to the end of a level, while Get the Rings has the players trying to get an amount of rings. The second player gets to play as Tails, which is unique, as Sonic is the only playable character in the single-player game.[CR]Zones[CR]Neo South IslandNeo South Island - Neo South Island is a zone which is largely inspired by Green Hill Zone from the original Sonic the Hedgehog. Despite being based on the Green HIll Zone level, it does contain things from the Emerald Hill level in Sonic the Hedgehog 2 and from the Palmtree Panic level in Sonic CD.Secret Plant - Secret Plant is based on Chemical Plant Zone, from Sonic the Hedgehog 2. The level has enemies and such from Sonic the Hedgehog 2.Cosmic Casino - Cosmic Casino is a zone that is based on Sonic the Hedgehog 2's Casino Night Zone, in which the player navigates a large, casino filled with bumpers, enemies, and more.Aquatic Relix - Another zone that is based off of a Sonic the Hedgehog 2 zone. This time, it is based on Aquatic Ruin Zone. It is of note that this and Secret Plant are the only levels in the game to contain underwater portions.Sky Chase - Sky Chase is a zone that is inspired by Sky Chase Zone in Sonic the Hedgehog 2. In this zone, Sonic rides on the wings of the Tornado (Tails' airplane).Aerobase - Aerobase is a zone that is also based on a level from Sonic the Hedgehog 2 titled Wing Fortress Zone. It takes place on a huge, flying warship.Gigantic Angel - Gigantic Angel has a background design that is taken from the original Sonic the Hedgehog's Scrap Brain Zone. It also is filled with obstacles and traps that are taken from Metropolis Zone in Sonic the Hedgehog 2.Last Utopia - Last Utopia is a battle between Sonic and Dr. Robotnik. Dr. Robotnik flies around in a large vehicle, while Sonic fights him.Chaotic Space - Chaotic Space is a bonus zone that isn't technically based off of any other zone, but rather plays similarly to Doomsday Zone from Sonic &amp; Knuckles.[CR]</plot>
