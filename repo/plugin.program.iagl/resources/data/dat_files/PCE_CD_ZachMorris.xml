		<emu_comment>The PC Engine CD-ROM add-on was released in Japan for the PC Engine console in December of 1988. The North American version, known as the TurboGrafx-CD, went on sale in 1989 for the TurboGrafx-16 (the North American version of the PC Engine). While it had little success in North America, the device boosted sales for the PC Engine in Japan. It helped the PC Engine outsell the NES for a while (up until the release of the SNES) and become the second best-selling console of the 16-bit era, behind the Super Famicom (which later planned its own PlayStation CD add-on) and ahead of the Sega Mega Drive (which later had its own CD-ROM add-on, the Sega CD).[CR]Developer:  Hudson Soft[CR]Manufacturer:  NEC[CR]CPU:  Hudson Soft HuC6280[CR]Memory:  64 kB[CR]Graphics:  HuC6260[CR]Sound:  6 Mini-Wavetable stereo audio channels[CR]Display:  565x242[CR]Media:  CD[CR]Max Controllers:  5 (Via Turbotap)</emu_comment>

        <plot>1552 Tenka Tairan is a war strategy game (with MOUSE support!) set during the Sengoku period of the Japanese history. The three campaign scenarios are set, respectively, in the years 1552, 1582, and 1600. The player is put in the midst of the so-called gekokujou situation, when ambitious daimyo (feudal lords) began to overthrow their superiors, resulting in a global war for dominance in Japan. The player controls such a warlord, choosing one of the available historical figures, or creating his/her own character. Character creation is Ultima-style; the player is asked a series of questions, and depending on the answer, the player-controlled general will have different statistics.[CR]The gameplay involves managing the army, advancing the troops, conquering neighboring provinces, defending own castle, etc. Though the game pauses when the player makes a decision, the time advances regardless of the player's actions, effectively making Tenka Tairan a real-time strategy game. Battles take place on separate screens, with a wealth of tactical possibilities for positioning and maneuvering the troops.</plot>

        <plot>Sanjiyan Henjō is based on the manga and anime series 3x3 Eyes. Pai, a young girl from the immortal tribe of sanzhiyan, three-eyed demons of Chinese origin, wants to become a human again. She meets a Japanese teenager named Yakumo Fujii, whom she accidentally turns into a "wu", an immortal obedient servant of a three-eyed demon. Together, Pai and Yakumo try to regain their lost humanity.[CR]This game can be considered a side-story to the series. The player does not control Yakumo, but an ordinary high-school student named Kenichi Yamamoto. Accidentally, Kenichi comes into contact with the world of demons, and now he needs the help of Pai and Yakumo to be freed. [CR]The gameplay is standard Japanese-style adventure. The player interacts with the game world by selecting menu commands "Look", "Talk", and "Move". The game features animated cutscenes and (in its console incarnation) voice-overs.</plot>

        <plot>Based on the Addams Family movie, this game is quite different from the other Addams Family variants. The player is cast in the role of Tully Alford, the crooked lawyer of the Addams family. He finds out that somewhere in the family mansion, a great treasure is stored in a vault. He decides to venture into the mansion and retrieve the treasure. Naturally, this is going to be anything but easy, as the insane Addams family members and a legion of ghosts and monsters are there to make sure the lawyer fails...[CR]Like most other Addams Family incarnations, this is a side-scrolling action game. Tully Alford's only weapon is an umbrella that fires energy shots at enemies. Tully can also jump and duck to avoid enemy blows. The game world consists of a "hub" area, the hall of Addams Family mansion, and many rooms, most of which are locked in the beginning of the game. The gameplay consists mainly of exploring the accessible rooms and collecting keys that are needed to open other doors in the process. Some of the rooms contain treasure and power-ups, while others are infested by monsters or require the player to defeat a boss enemy in order to advance.</plot>

        <plot>Adventure Quiz is a compilation of two games previously released on the arcades, Capcom World and Hatena? no Daiboken.[CR]Both games play very similarly: the player has to roll dice in order to navigate his/her alter ego on a board with medieval/fantasy backgrounds. Depending on the result, the character advances a certain amount of squares, which lead to various quiz challenges. The player has to answer a series of questions within a time limit, choosing the right answer among the several (usually four) available ones. Two-player gameplay is also possible.[CR]Upon reaching the final square of a "world", the player has to face a "boss enemy" (usually a character from popular games by Capcom, such as Side Arms, Forgotten Worlds, etc.). The boss offers the player a choice of several available topics for the decisive quiz. "Defeating" the boss leads the player into a new worlds with its own structure, etc.[CR]The themes of the questions are varied, ranging from history and geography to Japanese popular culture and very specific themes (such as bicycles).[CR]Hatena? no Daiboken is a follow-up to Capcom World, offering a few enhancements: multiple paths through some worlds, special squares that lead to new challenges (such as a quiz with only three possible answers), etc.</plot>

        <plot>The Cho Aniki series returns with their first sequel, the one that would cement the series humorous fetish with bodybuilders and other assorted stuff. As in the original Cho Aniki: Super Big Brothers, Ai Cho Aniki is a side-scrolling shooter in which you have to clear several stages of enemies with your flying avatar. Said avatar this time can be either of the two "option" bodybuilders that were supporting characters in the original while the original's main cast plays only small cameo roles as they appear every now and then to drop power-ups.[CR]Our two beloved speedo-wearing beefcakes also incorporate different play mechanics, as their attacks are often determined by button combinations (as in fighting games) which put a spin on the gameplay. Otherwise, the game's graphics and design are practically identical to the first game.</plot>

        <plot>Castlevania: Rondo of Blood (Akumajou Dracula X: Chi no Rondo) is a 2-D side-scrolling platformer with a gothic horror theme. Released in 1993, this game features the ability to save a player's progress, advances the plot via full-screen cutscenes, and utilizes CD audio tracks instead of the PC Engine's HUCard, producing a higher quality of musical audio.[CR]Set in the year 1792, you play as Richter Belmont, a vampire hunter. The dark priest Shaft has kidnapped Annette Renard, Richter's main love interest, and taken her to Castlevania along with a handful of other female victims. Wielding an ancestral whip imbued with holy powers to crush darkness, Richter heads out into the night alone to rescue the victims and deal out some justice, Belmont style.[CR]The game is divided up into multiple stages, some hidden, where the goal is to reach the end of each and (usually) face a boss monster. Along the way you may collect hearts from candles to power one of 6 different subweapons; the dagger, holy water, axe, cross, grimoire, and stopwatch. Each subweapon has a specific style of use and special "Item Crash" attack, which allows for an expensive but devastating super attack.[CR]Numerous hidden secrets may be found during the adventure, opening up pathways to new stages or leading to one of the four victims to rescue; one of which becomes a playable character after being freed. The victims Richter is able to rescue will affect which of the multiple endings you will see. Even if a maiden is missed, however, the player can return to any unlocked level later and take another shot at discovering any secrets they may have missed via the main menu's stage select.[CR]Rondo of Blood has great looking graphics, serves up multiple endings, plenty of secrets to discover, offers a decent difficulty level, and a delivers a quality soundtrack.</plot>

        <plot>Wisperad is a small universe that consists of only a few star systems. Hundreds of years ago, light-speed travel was invented, allowing the inhabitants of different star systems to navigate spaceships and establish contact with each other. Three hundred years ago, a great leader named Dumna founded a centralized kingdom where the different races populating the universe could leave in peace. However, after his death political tensions have increased, eventually resulting in the dissolution of the kingdom and the partition of Wisperad into three spheres of influence: the Mars Confederation, the Kingdom of Willia, and the Empire of Zolius.[CR]A young man named Sion Asmarn lives in the town of Cosma on the planet Homu together with his father, a famous explorer. One day, a huge meteorite falls on the planet. Sion's father goes to investigate it together with the physicist Mamon Penrose. Sion and his girlfriend Shoko, Mamon's daughter, venture into the canyon where the meteorite has fallen, only to witness Mamon, apparently possessed by a mysterious force, killing Sion's father and escaping. Determined to get to the bottom of this terrible affair, the two embark on a journey that takes them to different corners of the universe.[CR]Alshark is a Japanese-style sci-fi role-playing game with several distinguishing features. The player controls a party of up to five characters, exploring a vast world consisting of several solar systems, each with its own planets and space stations, many of which can be accessed in any order. Navigation in space is done with the help of the space ship Atlia, which can be equipped with various weapons, engines and frames. From time to time the player will engage in random space combat against enemy ships, earning scrap that can be converted into money. These dogfights are automatic by default, but the player can choose to control the ship and fire its weapons manually, in an arcade shooter style.[CR]The bulk of the exploration, however, takes place on planet surfaces, which the party can explore on foot or in vehicles such as buggies, tanks or hovercraft. Enemies appear randomly; combat is turn-based and is viewed from the same overhead perspective as the exploration. Only Sion is directly controlled by the player, while other characters follow AI routines, using normal attacks as well as offensive and healing techniques. Characters can equip head and body armor, futuristic melee weapons, as well as a variety of firearms. A "party talk" feature is available, with the characters being able to consult each other at any time. The game is also notable for allowing the characters to level up beyond the customary cap of 100.[CR]The Sega CD version has new anime-style cutscenes and audio music tracks, whereas the TurboGrafx CD version has a re-worked interface with full-screen navigation, as well as additional cutscenes and voice-overs. It also greatly reduces the amount of random enemy encounters during on-foot exploration, and generally lowers the difficulty level of the game.</plot>

        <plot>The two sisters, Ai and Yuuko, have taken different paths in life. Yuuko has been taken away by a mysterious gang. Ai is determined to save her from the clutches of crime. In a seemingly all-female city overrun by insane workers, biker gangs, and assorted criminals, Ai and her friends Chika and Makoto decide to work together in order to restore the world to normality again.[CR]Ane-san is what is commonly called beat-'em-up, i.e. a fighting game that allows limited movement through side-scrolling environment. The player can choose to control a variety of female fighters. In the beginning, only Ai, Chika, and Makoto are selectable. Ai is the all-around balanced character, Chika is fast and fragile, while Makoto is very strong, but slow. Later in the game, other playable characters become available. Each fighter has a health points bar, which can be restored by healing items scattered through the levels. Once a character is dead, the player can continue playing with another one.</plot>

        <plot>Genghis Khan II: Clan of the Gray Wolf is a 2D turn-based grand strategy game, based on the life of the historical Mongol leader Temujin, better known as Genghis Khan. The gameplay is similar to other grand strategy games from Koei, like Romance of the Three Kingdoms or Nobunaga's Ambition. The game has various scenarios from the Conquest of Mongolia (the unification of Mongol tribes) to World Conquest (with up to six playable factions). On the world/country map (divided into smaller provinces) the player develops his own provinces, gives orders to his subordinates, establishes alliances and recruits armies. The battles are presented in a separate mode, where the player directs troops using commands.</plot>

        <plot>Ryoran Girls' Private Academy is a high-quality school, which specializes in arts and sciences, but also in martial arts. Each year the most successful students hold a fighting tournament. Each girl represents her specific area of interest (science, sports, music, etc.), and each wants to be the great winner, for her club's and her own glory.[CR]Asuka 120% Maxima is not particularly story-driven; the story mode allows the player to choose any of the ten available girls, each featuring a short introduction, followed by a linear progression of battles against computer-controlled rivals, with a few bits of dialogue before each battle. The versus mode allows the player to compete against any opponent controlled by computer, as well as two-player battles and a "watch mode", in which the player assigns fighters to computer AI and watches how they unfold.[CR]The combat system follows a rather standard fighting game scheme; the girls execute a variety of kicks, punches, and attacks with special weapons, by pressing combinations of buttons. Girls might have unique weapons and techniques which are associated with the club/subject they represent; for example, a "tomboy" athletic girl will attack with baseballs and other sports accessories, etc.</plot>

        <plot>The Atlas (ジ・アトラス The Atlas) is a multiplatform strategy/simulation video game developed by Artdink Development. The game is set during the Age of Discovery in the 15th century.[CR]There is a strict time limit of five years to discover mysterious lands that are 1,000 miles or 1,600 kilometres south of Portugal.[1] Players can work for an admiral and can either change employment or even retire. Specialized names for the adventures, along with their characteristics and every kind of information possible is synthesized by the combination of certain attributes. The topographic features are created completely by random by a method of biosynthesis.[CR]Elements of war and plague affect the political stability in each of the game's regions. As the years progress in the game, trade and exploration play a role in impacting the in-game economy. Procurement, pestilence and contagious diseases are created through trade; decreasing the number of residents that reside in that particular town or city. These factors may also lead to the loss of vital trade ships. A contingent of information is used in order to enhance the illusion of being taken home. The map in the game is basically close to that of the parts of the Earth that were known in the 15th century. Encyclopedias can be found in the cities in addition to world maps and local specialties. Even animals can be found in the in-game towns. Strange life forms and primitive civilizations are randomly distributed on the map, they are described in the encyclopedia that covers the entire in-game universe. The truths that are accidentally synthesized will also players to get a mysterious world consisting of fictional things. The grotesqueness and strange phenomena can actually been seen and experienced.</plot>

        <plot>Foregoing the generic fantasy setting of most RPGs, Aurora Quest casts you as Otaku-chan, a man in a land controlled by a group of five women called Aurora (who would pass quite easily for a Japanese girlie band). Together with your fellow travellers, Jonjon and Nekketsu, you work your way through a humorous sci-fi story. The gameplay is very standard RPG stuff with towns containing shops, hotels and so on, and the world map throwing up random encounters every few steps. These battles are turn based with the usual mechanics of selecting your attacks and watching them play out - although you have to choose carefully, as you don't default to the next available target when one is destroyed, which will often have you shooting into thin air.</plot>

        <plot>A devastating atomic war wiped out the biggest cities on the Earth and most of its population. Anarchy reigned, different military organizations fighting each other in a new war for dominance. One of such organizations eventually seized control of the planet, establishing itself as a tyrannic government and using advanced technology for military purposes. Only a lone pilot can save humanity from their clutches...[CR]Avenger is a vertically-scrolling shooter, in which the player navigates a plane through levels populated by hostile planes, tanks, cannons, ships, stationary devices, and massive boss enemies. Before each mission, the player can choose among different weapons in three categories: main, sub, and special. Main and sub weapons are fired simultaneously and have unlimited ammunition, while the powerful special attacks are accessed by pressing a different button and are limited. The player can try any combination of the three categories, for example enhancing the main rocket launcher with a pod that fires laser to the sides as a sub weapon, and a protective shield as a special one. Power-ups change properties rapidly, so the player has to catch them at a specific time to enhance either main, sub, or special weapon. Those power-ups do not change the properties of a weapon, but rather give it additional fire power.</plot>

But an accident happened, and the humans were thrown into a parallel universe. Years have passed until they have adapted themselves to the different civilization. This parallel world, composed of three huge continents, is called Babel. Zell is a teenage boy, an orphan who lives in a post-apocalyptic world riding his bike, together with his friend Alice, who is like a big sister to him. One day they meet a mysterious girl named Sefia who seems to be on an important mission. Their struggle against evil begins at that moment...[CR]Babel is a Japanese-style RPG set in a futuristic world. Zell and his party travel around the world, visiting large cities and encountering many randomly appearing enemies. During the turn-based battles, each character can use a variety of attacks with different weapons, as well as special techniques. The combat window shows animated moves of the party members. Unlike in most role-playing games, characters do not receive experience points from defeating enemies; only money is gained. The characters level up according to the player's progress in the narrative.</plot>

        <plot>Baby Jo: "The Superhero" is a side-scrolling platform game. Jo can pick up rattles which can be tossed at enemies (such as bees, lawnmowers or spiders). Apart from watching out for the baby's dropping health (represented as an increasingly tearful face), the baby's diaper gets wetter over time and the thirst increases, too. If the diaper becomes too wet or the baby becomes too thirsty, the player immediately loses a life, so collecting fresh bottles and diapers is important.</plot>

        <plot>[I]Bakuden: Unbalance Zone[/I] is a humorous game in which the player controls a nerdy, video game-playing boy who is one day visited by four strange men who tell him he must venture into a different reality. The unlikely hero is transported to the prehistoric era, where he must set things right with the local tribe and dangerous wildlife.[CR]The game consists of non-interactive comic book-style scenes with voice-overs, as well as short, very simple adventure-like segments. During these segments the player has five icons at his disposal, each corresponding to a context-specific action. Only one of these actions can solve the problem at hand, but others trigger humorous animations and allow the player to proceed even if the result was fatal.</plot>

        <plot>The game is based on the comedy TV show Yoshimoto no Shinkigeki, which in its turn is based on a theatrical comedy show popular in Osaka and its surroundings. The game stars characters that either look like the actors from the TV show and/or resemble characters played by them. [CR]The show consists of short episodes which are depictions of comical situations, and are not related to each other story-wise. Same can be applied to the game: there is no real story, just a stretch of hilarious and intentionally impossible situations the protagonists find themselves in.[CR]The setting is deliberately nonsensical, with the locations ranging from typical Japanese suburbs to ancient Japan, town in the American Old West, North Pole, etc. Scenarios are full of anachronisms: for example, one of the protagonists is sent in a space rocket to outer space from a desert near an Old West town, bumps into a planet, and falls back without taking any damage.</plot>

        <plot>Two young and lovely bounty huntresses, Ryeza and Anita, live in a village that is continuously attacked by monsters. One day, solving a little monster problem in the nearby forest, they encounter a mysterious masked man, who tells Ryeza she wields the power of the sacred jewel Basted. Soon the two girls join forces with a princess in exile, and work together to restore the throne to its rightful owners, persecuted by the ruthless Empire and its allies.[CR]Though [I]Basted[/I] may look like an RPG at first sight (medieval setting, top-down world, game progression that alternates between towns and dungeons, etc.), it is in fact primarily an action game. Controlling Ryeza and Anita, the player explores the surroundings, talks to people and participates in battles to advance the story. There are no levels, items, equipment, money system, or other required RPG elements.[CR]Most battles occur as dictated by the plot, though some are optional. The battles take place on a separate screen. For most battles, the player is able to choose either Ryeza or Anita. Ryeza can jump, and Anita has a long-ranged fire attack. Regular attacks can be powered-up if executed when the attack power meter is at maximum. Both girls can also charge power to execute devastating special attacks (two unique attacks per girl). They are also able to dash and attack while dashing, inflicting more damage.[CR]The game features a large amount of fully voiced anime-style cutscenes to advance the story.</plot>

        <plot>Bazaru de Gozaru no Game de Gozaru is a puzzle game starring a monkey protagonist named Bazaru. The concept of the game is remotely similar to that of Lemmings: the player's task is to "program" the actions of the hero in order to safely traverse a stage full of traps and hazards. Unlike Lemmings, there is only one primate to control in this game; also, the player's "programming" must be performed before letting the monkey loose, unlike the real-time player input in Lemmings.[CR]The player basically orders the monkey what to do at specific spots (which are highlighted by exclamation marks on the level map). In the beginning the levels are short and simple, and the monkey can perform only one action. As the game advances, the puzzles become more and more complex, and so is the amount of actions the monkey must perform to reach safety.</plot>

        <plot>Based on a manga/anime character, Bikkuri Man Daijikai is less a game, more an encyclopedia of information. You start off with a map screen, and upon selecting the first location, you are presented with the standard information screen which consists of an image, character information (all in Japanese of course), a book to flick to the next image and a couple of other options. Clicking on the image or on its icon beneath it can bring up more characters to look at, and sometimes clicking on a part of the image brings up a description of that part. At various times a quiz screen will appear and you'll have to answer a question to proceed. As you progress, the amulet on the right will gradually build up and selecting this takes you to another screen with bonus pictures.</plot>

The player controls young women clad in robotic suits, who compete against similarly equipped female opponents in the game of mahjong. There is only one mode in the game, and the player has no ability of selecting the controllable character or the antagonist. Each round won by the player depletes a portion of the opponent's "health", which results in gradual undressing culminating in full nudity.</plot>

        <plot>According to [I]Blackhole Assault[/I], the 22nd century sees earth technology advance to the point where exploration of the immediate solar system is not only possible, but necessary due to resource constraints. Humans are attempting to harvest the resources of the entire solar system but have met with trouble from alien invaders. It is up to a small force of humans who recognize and understand the threat to confront the aliens head on.[CR]The weapon of choice in this game is the Cybernetic Anthropomorphized Machine, or C.A.M. The C.A.M. is a large robot that fights 1-on-1 against alien robots. All of the gameplay in Blackhole Assault revolves around single-round, 1-on-1 robot fighting action. There are 10 backdrops against which to beat up robots, including various planets and moons around the solar system.[CR]The game has 4 different modes. The main story mode is Operation BHA. The exhibition mode allows players to customize matches down to the robots each player will use and the backdrop to play on. The exhibition mode can be configured to allow one or even both fighters to be controlled by the computer. Further, the game has tournament and league modes.</plot>

        <plot>The Deguna Empire is terrorizing the planets and their inhabitants, using their unbeaten military force consisting of "Powered Gears", giant combat robots piloted by human fighters from the inside. One day, a squad of Empire robots assaulted a laboratory, in which two scientists were working on their own Powered Gear project. One of the scientists, heavily wounded, still managed to deliver a Powered Gear control device to his young apprentice Aref, before he died from his wounds. Enraged, Aref swears revenge to the Empire and everything it represents. With his own new Powered Gear, and perhaps a few allies who think alike, the idea might not be as suicidal as it sounded first...[CR]Blood Gear is a role-playing game with action-based combat. The general gameplay system is somewhat similar to that of the Exile series: town exploration is performed from the standard "RPG-like" top-down view, while all hostile areas are presented as side-scrolling levels, sometimes with elaborate platform structures. [CR]The player fights enemy robots in real-time combat, similarly to a regular side-scrolling action game. Player-controlled Powered Gear can be equipped with a variety of weapons. Both melee and ranged weapons (pistols, assault rifles, laser guns, etc.) can be purchased in stores and/or found while exploring hostile areas. Health is restored with repair kits of various efficiency, which can also be purchased, found, or randomly dropped by enemies.[CR]Each time an enemy is defeated, the player is rewarded points. There is no separation between money and experience points in this game; the same kind of points is used to buy items, repair and upgrade the Powered Gear. In factories, the player can choose to upgrade the Powered Gear in one of the three categories: body, arms, and legs. Each of these categories has three sub-categories of its own, influencing speed, strength, and other parameters of the body part. Each upgrade cost a certain amount of points; it can also be reversed, and the points invested in another upgrade.[CR]To make "power leveling" possible, enemies re-spawn whenever the player-controlled Powered Gear enters an area, and sometimes even if he walks off the screen and comes back.</plot>

        <plot>Bonk's Big Adventure is the third instalment in the side-scrolling platformer series. As in previous games, the player assumes the role of a caveman named Bonk who headbutts his way through various enemies in order to defeat King Drool. Familiar moves include swinging on trees, bouncing off walls, breaking blocks and climbing walls with his teeth. Compared to the previous games, he walks and moves a little faster.[CR]Bonk has the new ability to pick up red and blue candy power-ups that make him grow or shrink and grab a flower copter. As always, there is plenty of platforming and enemies to discover. The game consists of seven rounds, set in the Dinosaur Kingdom, finished off with a boss. At the end of each stage, 16 smileys can be exchanged to play up to eight different bonus stages (2 smileys per stage needed). New level elements include ziplines and sewer pipes. The game also features a cooperative multiplayer mode.</plot>

        <plot>SEA SQUARE", a gigantic man-made island on the Atlantic Ocean, an armed fortress controlled by a mysterious army. It is evident that they are developing the most evil weapon for slaughter to maintain and grasp its superiority of military power in the world. Joint forces have taken the motion for a special a action (irregular combat) and have prepared a mobile weapon "BROWNING", to destroy the ultimate weapon....according to the official blurb that is.[CR]Browning is a side scrolling action game that puts the player in a power suit and pits them against hordes of miscellaneous mecha with some very big guns. You walk and shoot, run and shoot and also fly and shoot, although flight time is limited due to the useless engineers failing to fit a large enough fan in your jetpack. After ploughing through a few screens of nasties, you are presented with a particularly unfriendly boss mecha who seems intent on aggressive negotiations. After quickly dispatching said boss, you are free to move on to the next level and do it all over again![CR]You say... [CR]Browning isn’t apparently well liked in the gaming community. I have no idea about the background of this game but what I do imagine is that a lot of people might feel ripped off.[CR]The game sports maybe five generic enemies, and is only five levels long. Worse yet, most of them have the boss waiting just a few steps away from the starting point![CR]As far as difficulty goes, the game is hard, but for the wrong reasons. Just the simple act of turning around requires a double tap of the directional button, and if you wanna run in that direction, well...let’s just say you are going to take a hit most likely. Worse, your “shield” can be fully depleted in two hits, it recharges slowly and once you lose it it’s gone and one single hit will make you explode, and force you to restart the stage with a “continue” (I don’t know if there is a limit to the continues in the game). And the rockets/jets that can make you fly real fast, even backwards, overheat constantly, so they’re not gonna be much help either. The game also does not feature any speedups or power ups/different weapon types that I know of.[CR]Overall, your worst enemy in the game will be the time limit. The first level boss can be completely destroyed by just ducking and shooting at it, but the last two levels have the tendency to have more then one boss. It’s especially heinous in Stage 4, where I pretty much had to resort to using a cheap trick and being lucky enough to fly over all the enemies in the level up to the boss without shooting them or getting hit once, and even then I had just 12 seconds to spare when I beat the two boss robots that come out once you beat the first one. Level 5 is a little less aggravating, but still, on my first try I blew the boss up 2 seconds before the end of the time limit, and before the game took note of the fact, I blew up (for some reason your employers blow you up if you don’t finish your task exactly as planned...sheesh, talk about punctuality). This is due to the fact that the final boss’s first weak points (the hands) only take damage when they feel like it. Most of the time you will just shoot at them and nothing will happen and then randomly they will start blinking when hit by your bullets for some reason. I still have no idea what that was about.[CR]And then...the game ends. And if you’re like me and you just skip all the cutscenes...you’ll end up on the startup screen, wondering what happened. Overall, Browning isn’t horrible, but it’s not really even mediocre.[CR]apachacha[CR]Cheats/Tips[CR]ARCADE MODE: Pause the game and push SELECT to toggle between arcade and normal modes.</plot>

The aim is to escort your little buddy across the vast playing area without him getting stuck, burned up, eaten by sheep etc. To do this, you can pick up and move various items that are scattered around the landscape, such as blocks to fill in gaps or create handy slopes, bombs to destroy areas of the map and so on. All this time your red headed friend is moving forward with alarming rapidity towards his doom. Thankfully, you can freeze the action to give yourself some breathing space to juggle things around, but this is limited to a timer which counts down slowly at the top of the screen.</plot>

        <plot>Your goal is to destroy the balloons which bounce around the playfield. To accomplish this, you can shoot hooks which travel upwards, and blow up any balloon they touch. Depending on their size, they either split on two smaller ones, or evaporate if they're at their minimum size. Apart from balloons, some levels also have barriers that have to be destroyed with your hooks, since they often block your access to balloons. There are also some barriers which cannot ever be destroyed. Your character has the ability to climb ladders, but cannot jump.</plot>

The characters belong to different classes (warrior, mage, ninja, etc.) and have different parameters and special attacks. Despite the game's visual similarity to contemporary Final Fantasy games, it has no true role-playing elements and consists entirely of battles.</plot>

The player controls a nameless protagonist who finds himself in a casino and has to win enough money to view animations of young warrior women removing their clothes in style. There are several types of pachinko machines, though they all follow the same basic formula: the player has to adjust the strength of the shot in order to send the ball through, accumulating jewels which are then automatically exchanged for money. When the player has gathered a sufficient amount of money he is allowed to watch the girl's undressing stage.</plot>

        <plot>After the success of PC Denjin, our hero leaps onto CD with a whole new game and a whole new soundtrack. Flying over the various landscapes (you get to choose which order to play the first four levels in), you come up against tidal waves, giant robots and a general array of nasty but cute bad guys as you would expect. The plants from the original PC Kid games are still here to provide such joys as extra firepower, fountains of smiley faces or the tiny-denjin which makes dodging bullets that little bit easier. Another handy little trick is that your boots also pack a punch, so backing into an enemy is more likely to dispose of them than do you any permanent damage. Part way along each of the levels you get the chance to rescue a friend who then joins with you, giving you a specific extra ability. These friends are pre-set one per level and cannot be chosen, and they allow things like rapid-sushi-fire and handy rear shots.</plot>

        <plot>The Asano family possessed a heirloom known as the Sorcerer's Trump. In the year 1984, however, it was stolen under mysterious circumstances. Seventeen years later, Sayaka, the young heiress of the Asano family, forms a group together with her friends Miki and Kyoko, and the three begin looking for the lost treasure. Heist after heist goes by unsuccessfully. Eventually, the girls organize a TV show, challenging dubious personalities to card games, hoping to find the Sorcerer's Trump in process.[CR]Cardangels is a card game in which the player takes the roles of the three friends, playing cards against young, attractive female opponents. Four types of card games are available: poker, blackjack, speed, and babanuki (a variant of old maid). A slot machine-like introduction determines which games are played against which opponents. The player can select the amount of rounds (minimum ten) needed to win a game and advance to the next opponent. The "free play" mode allows the player to choose the type of game actively, but the amount of available opponents is lower. There is no gambling in any of the games; points are awarded for combinations in poker and blackjack. The opponents undress after losing a game; however, they retain their underwear - there is no explicit nudity in the game.</plot>

        <plot>Castlevania: Rondo of Blood is the first CD game in the series, which allowed for more features to be included, such as CD quality soundtrack and visual cut-scenes. The opening, ending, and various cutscenes done in a hand-drawn visual style are included in the game. However, at the time this wasn't considered to be a very popular decision. Various details in the terrain are more polished than previous entries, and the behavior of the enemies is more elaborate. For example, the boss characters in the game will perform an unique final attack when their health meter is depleted. If the player didn't sustain any damage during the fight and manages to avoid this attack, a "Perfect Bonus" (1UP) is obtained.[CR]The mechanic of picking upgrades in order to power up the whip, which until that time was a staple of the series, has been removed. A new feature is the Item Crash, a special sub-weapon attack during which the player becomes momentarily invincible and a powerful attack is performed, at the expense of a large amount of hearts. Similar to Castlevania III: Dracula's Curse, a branching path system has been implemented, but with some differences. Unlike the former, it's not possible to choose between two paths in between stages. Rather, there are two ways to proceed through a stage, one of the paths being hidden. Finding this path requires several tricks such as destroying a wall, deliberately falling down a pit, and so on. In addition, there are four characters who have been kidnapped by Dracula and require to be rescued. One of these characters, Maria, becomes playable after being rescued. She attacks with magical, whimsical skills, such as throwing doves at enemies, hiding in a turtle shell, and other animal based attacks. When playing as Maria, the cutscenes when rescuing the other characters, the conversation with Dracula, the ending, the player's defeat sequence, as well as the Game Over screen become more light-hearted in tone.[CR]Once a stage is cleared, it can be selected from the "STAGE SELECT" in the file screen at the start of the game. Choosing "PLAYER SELECT" allows switching to Maria. Other things which are displayed are the completion percentage, the amount of continues left, "SOUND TEST", and "TECHNIQUE". The latter are videos which show the correct strategy to use against bosses. These videos can be unlocked by collecting certain amounts of money.</plot>

        <plot>This platform-based action game is set in the land of Alurea. The idyllic life of the Alurean people was shattered when the King is killed by a dragon, and a range of nasties inhabit the lands. Fortunately his twin sons have come to the rescue, and you must take control of one or the other to put the world right.[CR]The boys have differing skills - one is more skilled in sword-fighting (which you are always armed with), the other in magic (available in limited amounts on each level). You collect coins as the game goes on, and spend these in the shop on extra magic, extra lives and enhanced swords.[CR]There are 3 levels on offer - Earth, The Heavens and The Sea, and these can be tackled in any order. The first is straight platform action, the second involves jumping across clouds, and the third sees your characters swim. After those are completed, you must venture into the Monster Castle and finally slay the dragon.</plot>

        <plot>The odd world in this shooter made for quite the conversation piece in its day. Players control either Idaten or Benten, celestial warriors out to bring an end to the tyrannical rule of the emperor of Planet Builder, who holds muscular prowess to be the supreme virtue of the universe. Aided by able-bodied muscle-head options Adon and Samson, they must battle to defeat the emperors army across five stages. Use the buttons to fire away and lay into the Builder forces! Power up your character and options with protein from defeated enemies to have them "bulk up" with a yell, and take their macho battle to the next level!</plot>

        <plot>A fairly straightforward strategy game that was similar to the Nectaris games on the platform. The story was based after the events in "Macross: Do You Remember Love", featuring original characters. The appeal of the game was largely the cinematics and the Macross license, since there were no shortage of generic turn based strategy games at the time.</plot>

        <plot>Choosing to move on with a new story rather than that of the Macross anime, the creators of Macross 2036 brought in the original character designer, Haruhiko Mikimoto, for this horizontal shoot 'em up. The game features extensive anime sequences between levels to recreate the feeling of the show, and these are well drawn although quite heavy in dialogue. The gameplay itself is nothing new - you have a primary weapon and optional secondary weapon that is extra powerful, and you have to mow down the Zentradi forces in your Valkyrie (which only gets to transform at specific points). Power-up pods increase your firepower a little each time, while hidden Minmay heads give extra lives.</plot>

        <plot>Color Wars is a puzzle game in which up to four players try to win by putting colored balls on poles, converting adjacent balls to their color. Each stage consists of a rotatable 3D screen containing a number of poles of the same height. Players take turns in placing balls onto these poles. Adjacent balls (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) can be "captured" and hence change their color. Points are awarded per ball of each color. The round ends when there is no more place on the poles to put balls onto, and the player with the most points wins.[CR]The story mode begins with an introduction depicting a powerful demon that can only be vanquished by traveling to the Color World; a young pilot ventures there and must defeat opponents in the Color Wars game at each stage. This mode puts one player against three AI-controlled opponents; the free mode also allows four human players to compete against each other. Two-player mode can be played by either two human players or one player against computer AI.</plot>

        <plot>Van is a young boy who lives on the planet Idea, a place where technology has not yet reached a high level. One day his sweetheart Laura gets kidnapped by an unknown villain. Van soon discovers that Laura possesses mysterious powers that may grant immortality to the one who marries her. That is exactly what the evil wizard Galam has in mind. Van sets off to rescue Laura, on a quest that involves intergalactic journeys and travel through time.[CR]Cosmic Fantasy 2 is a sequel to Cosmic Fantasy: Bōken Shōnen Yuu, and the only installment in the series to have been released in the West. Though initially not directly related to its predecessor story-wise, the game features several common characters and themes.[CR]Like the previous game, it is a Japanese-style RPG set in a mixed sci-fi and medieval world. The game has random enemy encounters and simple turn-based combat mechanics. Player-controlled characters can learn and use various offensive and healing spells; however, enemies are restricted to physical attacks. Characters join and leave the party frequently, as dictated by the plot; the party may contain up to four active combatants. Story progression and overworld exploration is linear; dungeons are usually fairly complex and maze-like. Full-screen anime-style cutscenes with voice-overs advance the story of the game.</plot>

        <plot>Somewhere on the beautiful planet Aira, in a small village Toto lives a young boy named Rei. Rei possesses unique spiritual powers, using which he can heal diseases. One day, Rei is ordered to go to Tristan, the Royal Capital, where he is needed. This seems like a simple journey; but shortly afterwards Rei meets the cat Nyan, who got stranded on Aira following a hostile encounter with Burakki, Gorokki, and Chorokki, intergalactic feline travelers with unknown agenda. The boy realizes that his powers might be needed to aid the heroes of the previous [I]Cosmic Fantasy[/I] installments, and deal with the mysterious Garudo, who recently came to Aira, plotting an evil scheme. [CR][I]Cosmic Fantasy 3: Bōken Shōnen Rei[/I] is the third installment of the [I]Cosmic Fantasy[/I] sci-fi anime role-playing series. It is a traditional Japanese-style RPG with turn-based, first-person perspective combat. Enemies appear randomly. Rei and other party members can execute various types of physical attacks and techniques in battles, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. The game features anime-style cutscenes with voice-overs. Instead of separate locations tied by a traditional "world map", the game has a continuous world, in which locations are seamlessly connected to each other.</plot>

        <plot>After the first chapter of [I]Cosmic Fantasy 4[/I] described the brave deeds of Yū and his team on the planet Kazarin, it is now the turn of Van, the other great [I]Cosmic Fantasy[/I] hero and the protagonist of Cosmic Fantasy 2, to fight the evil forces who threaten the peace of the galaxy. Van awakens after having a nightmare that has been pursuing him after he has left his home planet Idea and joined Cadette Babette (Rim in the Japanese version) as an intergalactic cosmic hunter. However, a meeting with a friend in trouble from convinces him that his quest is just about to begin. Van and his Little Fox Team must return to Idea, and face the shadows of Van's tragic past.[CR]The gameplay is virtually identical to that of the first chapter, and has little deviation from the traditional Japanese RPG formula: the player navigates a party of heroes over the top-down world, visiting towns, descending into dungeons, and fighting randomly appearing enemies in turn-based fashion. Like in the previous game, the Final Fantasy-like ATB bar indicates the speed of the characters' turns during the battles. The second chapter also opens with a "digital comic" (basically a typical Japanese-style adventure), but after this introduction the RPG gameplay takes over for the rest of the game.</plot>

        <plot>The fourth installment of the sci-fi RPG series comes in two parts, this game being the first. In it, the player once again takes control of the original hero of the series, the cosmic hunter Yū, his lovely female comrade Saya, and their friends. Something is wrong on the planet Kazarin: the princess Saria was kidnapped, and Yū arrives on the planet to look closer into that matter, while Saya agrees to impersonate the princess for a while to ensure a calm investigation. However, their quest goes far beyond the kidnapping investigation: soon they will have to face the four heavenly kings, demons who control the elements from which the universe is built.[CR]The game features a role-playing system similar to the first three installments of the series and other Japanese RPGs: the player navigates a party of characters (up to four active combatants) around the top-down overworld, visiting towns, buying equipment, descending into dungeons, and fighting random enemies in turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective. A new introduction to the series is an ATB (active-time battle) bar (which came to prominence after having been first implemented by Final Fantasy IV): the player can only execute an action when the bar of the character in question is filled; therefore, switching between characters and reacting quickly becomes a necessity. The game begins with a "digital comic" introduction typical for most Japanese adventures (with menu commands to interact with still anime-style pictures); however, this gameplay mode disappears shortly afterwards and plays no further role.[CR]The mild erotic elements characteristic of the previous episodes have been somewhat intensified in this installment; a few scenes feature nudity in context of a sexual situation.</plot>

        <plot>[I]Kemono no Zokusei[/I] is an adventure game based on the anime series [I]Cyber City Oedo 808[/I] by Yoshiaki Kawajiri. The events of the anime and the game are set in 2808. Computerized crime has become rampant, and police has restored an ancient Japanese feudal habit of hiring particularly dangerous convicts to hunt down criminals. The player takes control of one of such convicts, Shunsuke Sengoku, the main protagonist of the anime. He must find his companions, the blind ex-boxer and hacker Gogol, and the effeminate Benten, in order to complete an assignment given to him by the police and eventually lower his sentence in prison.[CR]The game contains first-person screens with typical Japanese-style menu-based verb-object interaction during dialogues; however, most of the exploration in the game is done in third person, as Sengoku explores top-down areas, talking to people and gathering information and clues. There are no real puzzles in the game, but in some situations inventory items can be used or shown to characters.</plot>

        <plot>Daisenpuu Custom can be described as a remixed version of the HuCard game released in 1989. The game is based on the arcade shooter of the same name released by Taito/Toaplan in 1987 (also known as Twin Hawk). The players takes control of a World War II plane and fights his way through a vast array of enemy air defenses such as tanks, submarines and battle ships (curiously, there aren't any enemy planes in the game). Our fighter plane can use a classic Vulcan gun and a special, but limited, bomb attack. The latter calls a formation of friendly planes that will shoot at will until they eventually get hit. Pressing the bomb button twice triggers a powerful smart-bomb and wipes out most of the enemies on screen. A standard power-up system upgrades the plane throughout the game - destroying tiny truck usually frees up power-icons. Some, stamped with a large character P on them, upgrade the plane's main gun up to four times. Others give away extra bombs or rare extra lives.</plot>

For exhibition matches, the opponent can be built the same way.[CR]The game includes various hit types, depending on the player's position and timing. The direction of the ball can also be influenced when performing a shot. There are four different surfaces, influencing the gameplay, and three difficulty levels.</plot>

        <plot>Dekoboko Densetsu is a humorous game that combines elements of arcade action and racing. Up to five players can compete in the races. All the stages are vertically-scrolling (top-down), with the cars represented as small sprites of different colors. The player's goal is not only to beat the other cars, but also reach the finish line safely: each car has limited hit points, and continuously receives damage during the race.[CR]Damage can be sustained by driving over environmental hazards (pits, traps, bombs, etc.), failing to move the car forward in time (if the screen scrolls while the player-controlled car is at the bottom, it takes damage), being hit by the many enemies encountered in the game (which include a wide variety of wild animals, humans, fantasy creatures, monsters, etc.), or being hit by a competing car. Cars have the ability to jump over obstacles or enemy fire, avoiding damage.[CR]Over the course of the races, cars accumulate points depending on their results. These points can be invested in purchasing a limited amount of destructive weaponry (missiles, bombs, "boxing glove" that hits enemies from the side, oil to drop behind the car, etc.) or protective measures.</plot>

        <plot>Four beautiful sisters - Foltjunia, Eindebelle, Leamuroda, and Crealidelle - fight an evil alien race known as Bestia in deep space, transforming into powerful robotic machines. One day, Foltjunia is attacked and ends up unconscious on the pavement in one of the cities in Japan, planet Earth. There, she is found by a regular high-school student named Takaya. It appears that Foltjunia has lost her transformation abilities. Her sisters decide to stay with Takaya for a while, masquerading as high-school girls, which greatly complicates the young man's social and romantic life.[CR]Having the same characters and initial plot as Hatsukoi Monogatari, [I]Dennō Tenshi: Digital Ange[/I] is a Japanese-style adventure game with very limited interaction and strictly linear progression. Most screens allow the player to choose verb commands such as "Look", "Talk", "Watch", "Go", etc. from a menu, usually combining them with character and object names in a sub-menu. Typically, going through most or all options triggers the next event.</plot>

        <plot>Based on the popular Doraemon franchise, Nobita no Dorabian Night follows the adventures of the titular robotic cat, as he tries to rescue his friends from different time periods. How did this happen? Naturally, because of Nobita, Doraemon's best friend and geek extraordinaire. Something went wrong when Nobita was showing his friends a time machine, so they ended up stranded in hostile worlds, and now it's Doraemon's job to save them![CR]The game is a traditional platformer; Doraemon's main activities are jumping his way through the levels and eliminating enemies who try to stop him. Doraemon starts with an ordinary gun, but later is able to find other weapons, including a homing bowling ball launcher and a stun gun. He can also collect various power-ups, such as limited invincibility, high speed, an item that freezes all the enemies on the level for a short time, etc. It is possible to switch weapons and power-ups at any time.</plot>

        <plot>In this sequel to Down Load, the player once again takes control of Syd, a young "cyber diver" - a highly trained agent who is able to infiltrate the "cyber world", a virtual reality network that has replaced real life for so many humans in this grim futuristic scenario of the end of the 21st century. This time, Syd is up against an even bigger menace: a terrorist organization that has taken possession of Adolf Hitler's brain, in order to re-create it in a digital form, thus reviving one of the most vile and insane dictators in human history! [CR]Like its predecessor, [I]Down Load 2[/I] is a side-scrolling shooter; it shares many elements with the original game, such as the overall setting, "virtual reality" levels with abstract design (along with real-world locations), etc. However, the control scheme is a bit different. Instead of choosing a main weapon and a sub-weapon in the beginning of a mission, the player has four types of weapons and is able to switch between them at any time. In addition to the vulcan cannon and the laser beam from the first game, the player can also use homing missiles and a powerful short-range lightning gun as main weapons here.[CR]All the weapons can be upgraded with power ups, up to three times each. Another type of a power up increases the speed of the ship (yes, Syd pilots a spaceship-like aircraft this time, not his trademark flying bike). Secondary weapons must be picked up, and include additional missiles, bombs, and protective shields. As before, powerful boss enemies must be defeated before proceeding to the next stage. Anime-style cut scenes with voice-overs advance the story.</plot>

        <plot>Based on the crazy manga/anime, Dragon Half is a board game style of affair, similar to 21 Emon or some of the Peachboy titles. You progress around a board by rolling a dice, competing against other human or computer controlled players. Landing on different coloured squares has different effects. Some of these cause special events, others trigger animated battle sequences that require precisely timed button pushes for maximum impact.</plot>

        <plot>Dragon Knight and Graffiti is the remake of the first game in the Dragon Knight series.[CR]The remake has the same story (the wandering knight Takeru has to defeat a demon who threatens a town populated only by women) and core gameplay (explore a huge dungeon full of monsters, return to the only town to buy better weapons and equipment), but features better graphics, more convenient battle interface, and voice acting.[CR]Despite the abundance of pretty girls, there are no explicit sex scenes in this game.[CR]As the name implies, the remake also has a "graffiti mode" (accessible from the main menu), which lets the player view all the hand-drawn pictures of the game - those of pretty girls or any other kind.</plot>

        <plot>Strawberry Fields - a magic country populated almost exclusively by beautiful young girls (that is, if we don't count the Wise Old Man and a couple of other male exceptions). All went well in this peaceful place, until the evil witch Mesaana abducted some of the country's lovely inhabitants and placed a curse upon them, turning them into hideous monsters. Enter Takeru Yamato (whom you might know as Desmond, the hero of Knights of Xentar), a young adventurer who happens to be in Strawberry Fields at that time. Takeru is told that in order to remove the curse one has to find three sacred writings, buried deep within three dangerous dungeons. Looks like a job for our adventurer - especially because the rescued girls will probably be [I]very[/I] grateful![CR][I]Dragon Knight II[/I] is the predecessor to [I]Knights of Xentar[/I], the only [I]Dragon Knight[/I] game that was ever translated into English. This is a first-person game that is mainly dedicated to dungeon exploring. Takeru has to explore the three dungeons, fighting enemies and sometimes talking to dungeon inhabitants. The enemies are the girls who were turned into monsters by Mesaana. In town, Takeru can also buy weapons, armor, and items, and talk to various people.</plot>

        <plot>This version of Dragon Knight III is based on the earlier computer release, known in the West as Knights of Xentar. While retaining the story, the graphical style, and the basic location layout of the computer version, this release has substantial gameplay differences.[CR]Unlike in the computer version, the battles are not real-time, but turn-based, and utilize a different perspective; randomly encountered enemies are fought in a first-person, Dragon Quest-like traditional Japanese RPG style. Enemy design is also quite different; many of the monsters from the original version have been replaced with female characters. The graphics in the top-down areas have been slightly enhanced.[CR]This version also censors the adult content. The scenes are still suggestive, but there is no explicit nudity in them any more. Some of the cutscenes have been completely re-drawn, eliminating even implicit sexual activity.</plot>

        <plot>The Dynastic Hero is a slightly re-branded version of Wonder Boy in Monster World for the Turbo Duo.The game features palette-swapped visuals, new insect-themed graphics for main characters (and insects' natural predators as bosses), a Red Book audio soundtrack which is completely different from the Wonder Boy original, and anime-style cutscenes at the intro and ending. Shion was renamed Dyna and was modeled after a Hercules Beetle, and the final boss was changed to a giant lizard king. An English-language version was also produced, but both were built off of the Japanese version of Wonder Boy in Monster World. They feature the same difficulty and mechanics as the Japanese original.</plot>

        <plot>[I]Efera and Jiliora: The Emblem From Darkness[/I] is based on the anime [I]Gude Crest[/I]. The story stars two female mercenaries, Efera and Jiliora. After having escaped from a slave ship, through a series of events they come into possession of a powerful crest. This crest was taken away from the benevolent prince and princess, who were abducted by an evil cults that worships an ancient powerful deity. The two young women must find a way to save the royal offsprings, and defeat the evil worshippers.[CR]The game is an RPG with action-based combat. The player can choose to play as either Efera or Jiliora; there is also a two-player mode in which it is possible to control both. Efera is the weaker fighter, but she can use healing and offensive magic spells, which she learns as she levels up. Jiliora is stronger, but unable to cast magic; as she advances in levels, she obtains rings that can enhance her sword power, heal an amount of her HP, and even make her invincible for a while.[CR]As in most RPGs, player-controlled characters traverse hostile areas and fight enemies for experience and money, which can later be spent in towns to acquire better equipment and items.</plot>

        <plot>[I]Eiyū Sangokushi[/I] is a somewhat light-hearted depiction of the famous Three Kingdoms historical period in China. In its core, it is a turn-based strategy game, similar to the more popular Romance of the Three Kingdoms series. The player has the choice of playing through 8 different scenarios, starting with Dong Zhuo's rise to power in the late 2nd century, and ending with the last struggle of Cao Cao's sons and the destruction of the three kingdoms. The player can also construct his/her own map, and play it controlling any of the available [I]Three Kingdoms[/I] characters from any scenario.[CR]The player selects a warlord and his capital city, from which he manages his wars. Compared to [I]Romance of the Three Kingdoms[/I], the game is quite simple, with the battles being automatic and the player having by far less strategic options, focusing mostly on comparing statistics and building a line of generals powerful enough to attack the nearest city. Unlike most other historical games, the game has a comical, "super-deformed" graphical style, with famous Chinese warlords presented as typically Japanese big-eyed anime portraits.</plot>

        <plot>In Emerald Dragon the player takes control of Atrushan, a blue dragon who lives in the Dragon World. One day, he and his friends discover a ship wreck near a mountain. After examining the wreck, the dragons find a human child - a little girl. The wise White Dragon, the leader of the dragons, tells them that her name is Tamryn and that she will play an important role in their lives. The girl doesn't remember anything, and grows up together with the dragons. But when she turns fifteen, she decides to go back to her homeland - the Human World. Soon after Tamryn has left, Atrushan realizes he can't bear the separation, and asks the White Dragon to allow him to go and find Tamryn in the Human World. But a mysterious evil curse has been placed on the dragons - they can't appear among the humans in their true form. Atrushan agrees to become a human and goes to the Human World - to find Tamryn, and also a way to remove the curse... The game has many traditional Japanese-style RPG gameplay elements: Atrushan and his party travel around the game world, visit towns, descend into dungeons, and level up in an automatic fashion. One of the game's distinguishing features is its battle system. Characters are able to freely move over the battle field; the range of their movement depends on their agility rating. Only Atrushan can be given precise instruction during each turn. The player is able to position the characters strategically near or far away from the enemy, attack from different sides, and assign general strategies to the party members. Another notable feature of the game is the absence of a "world map": the game's locations are seamlessly connected with each other.</plot>

        <plot>Exile: Wicked Phenomenon is a sequel to Exile. The Japanese titled release is Exile II: Janen no Jishou (エグザイルII ～邪念の事象～). The game follows the adventures of the series' protagonist, the Middle Eastern assassin. Separated from his companions in the end of the previous game, Sadler encounters a mysterious prophet who tells him a curse has fallen upon Baghdad, and the destiny of the world lies in his hands. Sadler travels to Baghdad, where he encounters old friends and old enemies, and learns about a great threat that stirs hatred and turns people into monsters.[CR]Like its predecessors, Exile: Wicked Phenomenon is an action RPG. The game is viewed from top-down perspective when exploring towns and other peaceful locations, but switches to side-scrolling view for hostile areas. The player controls one character at a time, but is able to switch between Sadler and his friends (Rumi, Kindi, and Fakhyle), whenever they travel together. Each of the characters has advantages and disadvantages (strength, ranged weapons, spells, limited mobility, etc.). Characters gain experience points and money upon defeating enemies. Leveling up is automatic, increases the characters' parameters and hit points. In towns, characters can buy and equip weapons, armor, as well as healing and supportive items.</plot>

        <plot>F1 Circus Special is a Formula 1 racing game. Players can choose between a world championship mode, which follows the path of one driver through the game's available courses in a linear fashion; a test drive mode, which allows players to choose any course as well as change rules and conditions (e.g. the amount of damage inflicted); and a time attack mode for competing against each other. [CR]There are twenty courses altogether in the game. The cars are modeled after real ones, their brand names slightly changed for copyright reasons. It is possible to customize brakes, tires, gears, wings, and other attributes of the car, or choose the "easy setting", which selects these parameters according to optimal speed or handling of the car. Digitized photos are used for driver portraits.</plot>

        <plot>Project F is a managerial simulation that puts the player in the role of the owner of a Formula 1 company. The player is responsible for paying salary to managers, mechanics, and other members of the staff; it is possible to raise or lower the salary, which may lead to various consequences depending on the employee's personality. Then the player makes contract with one or more drivers, selecting them from a list. Car customization plays an important role. Gasoline, engines, chassis, wheels, tires, brakes, and other components must be purchased from manufacturers of the player's choice.[CR]The racing competition itself is non-interactive. Tournament events follow depending on its schedule, and the player simply watches how the race unfolds and ends according to the participants' parameters. Brand and player names in the game resemble real ones, but have been slightly altered for copyright reasons.</plot>

        <plot>In [I]Meikyū no Elfeane[/I], the player takes the role of a real person - the Japanese singer and actress Tomomi Nishimura - in her hand-drawn, "super-deformed", anime-style, top-down-viewed incarnation (digitized photos of the real Ms. Nishimura can be seen during some of the game's cut scenes). In the game, Tomomi is just a simple girl who works in a restaurant, but gets magically transported to a fairy land. There, she must first protect the inhabitants of a peaceful town from goblin onslaught, and ultimately find a way to return to the real world. [CR]Despite the top-down view and the fact it was developed y the same company who have brought us distinguished Turbo CD RPGs such as Cosmic Fantasy series and Babel, [I]Meikyū no Elfeane[/I] is not a RPG, but an adventure - Japanese-style, with minimum puzzles. Most of the gameplay involves running around and talking to various inhabitants of the fairy world. There are also mini-games: a Pac-Man-like game with cars, a vertically scrolling shoot-em-up, a Breakout clone, and a quiz show.</plot>

        <plot>Tengai Makyou: Fuun Kabuki Den is a turn-based RPG developed by RED Company that stars Kabuki Danjirou, one of the four heroes from Tengai Makyou II. Unlike the previous entries in the series, the battle system does not have a first-person viewpoint, but rather a side view similar to that of the 2D Final Fantasy titles. The game is also a bit more lighthearted and humorous than it's predecessors, featuring elements such as villains who sing a song before doing battle with the party. Fuun Kabuki Den was first released by Hudson for the PC-Engine CD in 1993 and later saw a re-release in the Tengai Makyou Collection compilation for the PlayStation Portable in 2008.</plot>

        <plot>Formation Soccer 95 della Serie A is a soccer (football) game that re-creates a season in the top football league of Italy, including licensed players and teams. There is no management element in the game; players simply have to choose one or more (for tournament mode) teams and participate in either exhibition or Serie A (Italian Championship) games. Teams can be controlled by human players or computer AI; it is also possible to select the "watch" mode and view the game unfolding with both teams being controlled by the computer. Practice mode for corner, free, and penalty kicks is included as well. Rules and conditions can be changed (e.g. it is possible to play without injuries).</plot>

        <plot>Overdevelopment and crowding in Japan have forced many of its indigenous spirits and ghosts to lose their homes. Due to problems caused by the homeless spirits, a new profession was created, the Ghost Sweepers (GS). Private exorcists for hire, they serve only the highest bidder to survive in the cutthroat corporate world. Among this, the Mikami GS Company, led by 20-year-old Reiko Mikami and her two assistants, the 17-year-old boy Tadao Yokoshima and the ghost girl Okinu, is said to be the best.[CR]The scenario mode seems to consist of three parts[CR]Report 1 ("Into the Dreams") is based on the Nightmare event. The story then begins with Meiko asking Mikami to help her defeat a Nightmare that entered in her friend.[CR]Report 2 ("Mikami and Mikami") is based on the Mannequin event. People are being turned into mannequins, and Mikami is charged with committing crimes.[CR]Report 3 ("The Greatest Showdown in History") starts with Dr. Chaos and Maria going to Mikami's office to tell her that they spotted Teresa, and they ask for her help.</plot>

        <plot>Earth is the most beautiful planet in the galaxy, and its peaceful existence is threatened by the criminal mastermind Ballas. The galaxy police sends two agents to deal with the threat: Hiro Aoyama and Michiko Akasaka, who can transform into the powerful super-fighters Gayvan and Mittchi, respectively, and are alone able to stop Ballas.[CR]Galaxy Deka Gayvan is a brawler. Players can choose to control either of the two heroes, or both of them in a co-op mode. Like in other beat-em-up games, the player must defeat all the enemies on screen in hand-to-hand combat before being able to proceed. Both Hiro and Michiko can accumulate special energy (dropped by the enemies along with health power-ups and money) that allows them to transfer into the superheroes Gayvan and Mittchi and stay in that form until they run out of energy. The superhero forms are stronger and are able to execute special attacks.[CR]In addition, a two-player versus fighting mode is included. Players can choose either the protagonists or three enemy characters to compete against each other in one-on-one fighting.</plot>

        <plot>Again, the Lone Wolves return! [CR]Geese Howard may have been defeated, but that doesn't mean all is peaceful. A new opponent, Wolfgang Krauser, has come forth to begin a new Fatal Fury tournament. The Lone Wolves return, with new faces amongst them. Only one can be declared the winner though. [CR]The player can choose one from eight playable characters: Terry Bogard, Andy Bogard, Joe Higashi, Big Bear, Jubei Yamada, Cheng Sinzan, Kim Kaphwan, and Mai Shiranui. The game has four bosses. The combat system is more complex than in the first game, supporting four keys to attack. The two-plane (foreground and background) battle system has been retained, but now, the player can move freely to the adjacent plane - just by pressing the Light Punch and Light Kick buttons simultaneously. The main principle remains the same - beat your opponent in a duel with fists and kicks.</plot>

The two-plane (foreground and background) battle system has been retained, but now, the player can move freely to the adjacent plane - just by pressing the Light Punch and Light Kick buttons simultaneously. The main principle remains the same - beat your opponent in a duel with fists and kicks.</plot>

        <plot>You start the game as a nameless warrior (you can name the hero as you like). He returns to his home village, only to find it burnt down, and his beloved woman dead. Kneeling at her grave, the warrior swears revenge, but this quest soon turns out to go far beyond it, as demonic forces are threatening the land![CR][I]Gensō Tairiku Aurelia[/I] is a side-scrolling action RPG. You control the warrior (and other characters whom you can control later in the game) by moving him through platform locations - towns, forests, dungeons, etc. In towns you can talk to people to advance the plot. In wilderness areas, you fight enemies by attacking physically or using magic spells in real time. You can also jump in this game. You get experience points for defeating enemies, gain levels and stronger magic.</plot>

        <plot>This is the second game in the series about the school girl Yuna Kagurazaka, who fights crime in cosmic battles. [I]Eien no Princess[/I] continues the story of the first game. Yuna has defeated the 13 Servants of Darkness, and their leader Lia has become a friend, fighting crime on her own in a superhero TV show. Life seems to continue normally, the only trouble being Erika, a snotty high school girl who sees herself as Yuna's biggest rival. She challenges Yuna to a fight, but both are spotted by the titular starship "Eternal Princess", commanded by the pretty Princess Mirage, whose task is to stop violence in the whole galaxy. What begins as a misunderstanding ends as a serious threat to the Earth...[CR][I]Eien no Princess[/I] is what is usually called a "visual novel". Most of the game consists of the player being taken to different locations automatically, where he watches the story unfold, accompanied by text and voice acting. Sometimes there is a menu verb to click on (such as "Look at..."), which doesn't mean much since the menu offers no choices. There are, however, a few turn-based battles in the game, with different attacks to choose, such as attack, defense, special, etc.</plot>

        <plot>This is the second game in the series about the school girl Yuna Kagurazaka, who fights crime in cosmic battles. [I]Eien no Princess[/I] continues the story of the first game. Yuna has defeated the 13 Servants of Darkness, and their leader Lia has become a friend, fighting crime on her own in a superhero TV show. Life seems to continue normally, the only trouble being Erika, a snotty high school girl who sees herself as Yuna's biggest rival. She challenges Yuna to a fight, but both are spotted by the titular starship "Eternal Princess", commanded by the pretty Princess Mirage, whose task is to stop violence in the whole galaxy. What begins as a misunderstanding ends as a serious threat to the Earth...[CR][I]Eien no Princess[/I] is what is usually called a "visual novel". Most of the game consists of the player being taken to different locations automatically, where he watches the story unfold, accompanied by text and voice acting. Sometimes there is a menu verb to click on (such as "Look at..."), which doesn't mean much since the menu offers no choices. There are, however, a few turn-based battles in the game, with different attacks to choose, such as attack, defense, special, etc.</plot>

        <plot>Go! Go! Birdie Chance is an anime-style golf game. The player controls female high school students who assemble a golf team and wish to remain undefeated. The story mode contains extensive text-based cutscenes, depicting the girls' struggle against an arrogant male golfer, with golf matches proceeding as dictated by the plot. The free mode allows one or two players to select any of the three available female characters and compete against each other or computer AI. It is possible to select golf club types, course terrain, strike types, and the player's strong hand. Strength and direction of the shot is determined by stopping a moving bar at the right moment.</plot>

        <plot>God Panic is a vertically-scrolling shoot-em-up set in a cartoony, anachronistic version of feudal Japan with supernatural elements. There is no in-game background story or plot-advancing cutscenes, with the exception of a wise old man who would sometimes offer the cat-suit-clad hero some help. Creatures from Japanese mythology have gone wild, and it is up to the flying protagonist to defeat them, all the while defending himself against enraged villagers, mechanical cats, homoerotic wrestlers and other grotesque beings.[CR]The player character is armed with a standard gun in the beginning, which shoots in two lines straight in front of him. Power-ups are obtained by flying over treasure chests, usually placed on top of the screen. These grant the hero wingmen, additional shots, a new ray attack, extra lives, etc. Like in most scrolling shooters, a button is assigned to a powerful all-screen attack (in this case throwing coins) with limited charges. Stages culminate in boss battles, and some of them are built as a series of mini-boss encounters.</plot>

        <rom name="chd_pcecd/CHD-PCECD/Godzilla Bakutou Retsuden (Japan).chd" size="224794215"/>
        <plot>This interpretation of the famous giant monster from the Japanese cinematic industry takes form of a fighting game, only instead of the usual brave martial artists the players control horrifying monsters from the traditional Toho lineage: the titular beast itself, Rodan, Anguirus, Ghidorah, and others. The game has two modes: Normal and Vs. The latter is essentially a two-player mode, which allows the players to engage in giant monster battles in a variety of scenarios. Most of the monsters, however, are locked in the Vs. mode before the player has completed the Normal mode.[CR]The Normal mode puts the player in control of Godzilla, who has to go through five stages before reaching the final boss. Each stage has two battles against two different creatures in two different locations, from which the player has to complete only one in order to proceed to the next stage. Depending on the player's performance, points are awarded; in order to be able to compete against different final bosses, the player has to accumulate more points. If the player only has the minimum required points, only one final boss will be available.[CR]The combat system is similar to other fighting games, with various combinations of buttons executing different moves. Naturally, the normal "punch-kick" scheme is modified to suit the monsters' shapes and biological peculiarities. For example, monsters with tails can use tail spin attacks; fire-breathing monsters have a range fire attack, etc. Most of the monsters (including Godzilla) have a move when they hold the opponent and suck its blood.</plot>

        <plot>One of Sega's classic arcade titles, Golden Axe features three fantasy characters on their quest to destroy the evil Death Adder. At the beginning of the game you get to choose from the dwarf Gilius Thunderhead, the woman Tyris Flare and the man Ax Battler. The game itself is a scrolling beat 'em up with the player having to defeat waves of enemies as you progress. There are also a few creatures you can mount, such as dragons and the chicken-leg from Altered Beast which has a nice tail-whip attack to keep the bad guys at bay. At various points (and between each level) you will encounter tiny little humanoids dressed in blue or green - the green ones drop food to increase your health bars, the blue ones drop magic potions (although you have to put the boot in to get anything from them). Each character is able to cast magic spells, and the more potions you have, the more impressive and powerful the spells are. Gilius casts lightning spells, which are the weakest, Ax casts earthquake spells and Tyris casts powerful fire spells which can be powered up to give you a giant dragon that breathes flames all over the landscape.</plot>

Two years after its last epic battle, the GRADIUS army recommissions the VIC VIPER superdimensional warplane to combat the invasion of a new nemesis known as GOFER. Piloting the latest model of the VIC VIPER, players can select between multiple WEAPON MODULES and SHIELDS to tackle the varying stages and enemy attack patterns they come up against. With a total of nine stages, this perfect port of the original boasts one of the longest adventures in the series and features more of its trademark fast-paced background music to accompany the intense action!</plot>

        <plot>Tekipaki: Working Love is a simulation game somewhat similar to Graduation series, but with a much less complex system and "working girls" instead of students. The game's graphics were drawn by the manga artist Izumi Takemoto. The setting is 23rd century, and the player has to take care of three girls from different planets: Naomi, Hikaru, and Edalt. The goal is to make the girls successfully perform their working duties (mostly secretary-like assignments), at the same time having free time to rest. With each activity, certain parameters (stamina, intelligence, etc.) of the girl will increase and decrease. Since the three girls have different parameters from the beginning, it is important to understand their personalities and to find the right balance between work and leisure. The girls also have a "loyalty" parameter, that usually increases when the player lets them have a day off.</plot>

        <plot>Hawk F-123 is a side-scrolling shoot-em-up. There is no background story in the game and no cutscenes; the player pilots a fighter plane, flying over various areas such as a desert, a sea, a city at night, etc. Most of the enemies are different types of aircraft, though a few stationary turrets appear as well. [CR]The player-controlled fighter can pick up power-ups that change his primary weapon: red for a vulcan gun, yellow for energy bolts, and blue for laser. Each of these will increase in power (e.g. three lasers instead of one for the blue weapon) when the player repeatedly collects power-ups of the same color. Other power-ups add a secondary weapon or enhancement to any of the described above, such as homing missiles, fireballs, a wingman, etc. Secondary weapons are fired simultaneously with the main ones. In addition, special weapons can be collected and accumulated. These weapons are triggered by pressing a separate button, and include delayed bombs, exploding bullets, protective shields, and others.</plot>

        <plot>High Grenadier is a turn-based strategy game with role-playing elements. The game has a rather abstract plot that depicts a battle between two human organizations, each piloting and commanding giant mechs; no further details are revealed in the game. The gameplay takes place on a battlefield composed out of dots connected by lines; both player-controlled and opponent's army can move only between adjacent dots.[CR]The player has six commanders at his disposal; each of them can lead a several various mechas into the battle. Three commanders are available initially, while others can be called into battle later. Once a player-controlled and an enemy unit meet on the same dot, the player can order the commander to attack, defend, or retreat. The battle then proceeds automatically, its result calculated by the statistics of both units. The role-playing element involves leveling up mecha parts; a number of experience points is awarded after a battle, and the player can freely distribute them to raise the mecha's parameters.</plot>

        <plot>A high-school student named Kōsuke had a dream, in which he saw a beautiful woman talking to him. The next morning he found out that the new teacher looked very similar to the woman he saw. After overhearing a conversation, Kōsuke realizes that the new teacher is in fact a detective sent to investigate the murder of a female student that occurred in the gym. The young man has to play his cards right in order to become part of the investigation, solve the mystery, and perhaps impress the attractive teacher in other ways.[CR]Himitsu no Hanazono is essentially a visual novel. There are no verb commands and no real interaction with the environment. The choices are rather frequent and fairly numerous (usually four or five choices at most screens). Most of these choices, however, do not affect the plot, though they may alter subsequent dialogue. The player is also able to navigate the protagonist on school grounds and inside the main building in a top-down fashion, visiting locations in any order.</plot>

        <rom name="chd_pcecd/CHD-PCECD/Horror Story (Japan).chd" size="348737875"/>
        <plot>Originating on the arcades (where it was known as Demon's World to the Western audience), Horror Story is an "old-style" side-scrolling platformer/shooter. The basic gameplay premise is very simple: shoot and jump your way through large amounts of monsters, defeat the boss, proceed to the next level. There is no narrative of any kind in the game, and no cut scenes; the hero is a tough-looking Duke Nukem-look-alike equipped with guns. [CR]The screen is scrolling at all times, even if the player character doesn't move. The levels are almost entirely linear, the only choice sometimes being to stay on the ground or jump to the higher platforms. Cooperative two-player mode is available.[CR]Though shooting is decidedly the main gameplay element here, jumping (particularly double-jumping) must be used liberally to navigate the hero through platform-based stages, and avoid and kill enemies (since jumping on their heads eliminates them as well). Weapons can be switched by catching power-ups, which appear as floating, constantly changing letters. Depending on the letter the player decides to take, the hero will get different weapons. These weapons include: a steady energy beam of moderate power; flamethrower; bombs; a short-distance grenade launcher of sorts; and a gun that spits fireballs in three different directions.[CR]As the name implies, the game has a horror theme. The game begins in what looks like old Japan, complete with traditional Japanese demons, but later switches to more "mainstream" horror, complete with haunted towns, ghosts, zombies, skeletons, etc.</plot>

        <plot>Power Golf 2: Golfer is a follow-up to Power Golf. The game attempts to realistically simulate golf and contains many features and variables that influence gameplay. There are two modes in the game: Normal and Tournament. In the normal mode up to four players can compete against each other or computer opponent in stroke play, match play, driving range, and putting green. Real Japanese golf courses are available for selection, complete with digitized photos and introductions. The player can select to control Japanese golfers and choose between a variety of clubs, as well as manually influence the shot, controlling force, angle, and the exact part of the ball the player wishes to strike.[CR]The Tournament mode is essentially a managerial simulation game. The player takes control of a golfer in an unnamed city. The goal is to accumulate enough currency and fame, as well as increase personal attributes of the golfer in order to participate in tournaments. Currency is obtained by doing part-time jobs, e.g. as a caddie in golf matches, or by gambling at slot machines. The player can also visits shops to purchase clubs and other golfing equipment. There is an in-game schedule that keeps track of tournaments and also incorporates random events (such as accidents). It is also possible to send the golfer on a vacation when he is too tired from working or practicing golf.</plot>

It is possible to choose club types and (in the practice mode) golf course. The game is played from a first-person perspective, and requires the player to stop a moving bar at the correct moment to regulate the strength of the short.[CR]Formation Soccer: Human Cup '92 is a top-down soccer (football) game that allows the player to choose an international team out of several available European and American ones. Formation and goaltender behavior can be customized; however, no detailed player management is present. The championship mode allows one or two players to compete against the computer.[CR]Final Match Tennis Ladies is similar in style to Final Match Tennis, but with notable female tennis players (their names are slightly altered). It is possible to choose one of the three available tennis court types, as well as go through the Australian Open tournament controlling one competitor in a cup system.</plot>

        <plot>Its sub-title translated as True Scary Stories, Hyaku Monogatari is a video game homage to the parlour game Hyaku Monogatari Kaidankai, which was popular during the Edo period (17th - middle of 19th century) in Japan. The game involved gathering at night, lighting a hundred candles and telling horror stories, extinguishing the candles one by one until the room became completely dark.[CR]The game contains a hundred horror stories told in a linear fashion through text, digitized photos and sound effects. Most of the stories are very short and non-interactive. The exceptions usually involve visual novel-like choices of locations or responses to situations, which sometimes affect the story's conclusion. A recurrent episode involves visiting various locations in Tokyo area and reviewing criminal cases and ghost stories.</plot>

        <plot>Side Arms Special is, in essence, the same game as the regular edition of the arcade side-scrolling shooter Side Arms (with audio CD tracks instead of MIDI music) - plus a new gameplay mode called Before Christ.[CR]This mode can be considered a "hardcore mode", since the player has to return to the beginning of the level after the player character has died, as opposed to losing a "life" and continuing from the same spot in the regular mode. Also, while in the regular mode the player can change the type and direction of weapon (laser, spreading, etc.) at any time, in Before Christ mode, it is possible only upon picking up a corresponding power-up.[CR]Another change includes the ability to charge the weapon, similarly to the feature in R-Type. The charged beam is more powerful, but obviously requires more time to execute.</plot>

        <plot>IQ Panic is a quiz game with a background story. A demon has kidnapped a girl from a peaceful village, and the elders send a boy named Gengorō to bring her back, defeating the demon's minions using his intelligence and knowledge. The game has a pseudo-RPG structure, with top-down navigation, overworld, towns, dungeons, treasure chests, random and boss "battles", etc. However, real RPG elements are very light in the game: there is no leveling up, and the protagonist's health increases automatically following a plot-dictated boss encounter.[CR]The core of the gameplay are the trivia "battles" against randomly appearing characters. Each "enemy" will ask the hero one question in a variety of topics (English language, geography, popular culture, etc.). Answering the question correctly within the time limit will "kill" the enemy, while giving a wrong answer will reduce the hero's HP by one point. Boss enemies offer a choice of topics and take several correct answers to defeat. A few items can be used to restore HP, reduce the time limit, return to a town, etc.</plot>

        <plot>Iga Ninden Gaiou is an action game by Nichibutsu where the player takes control of a Samurai/Ninja who must rescue his lovely girlfriend. The game takes place in Ancient Japan where sword fights meet mystical magic and demons... but not only as later stages even transport the player to futuristic worlds and cities. The main character uses his sword most of the time to defeat his enemies. But he can also charge up and throw knives. RUN can also launch a mystical attack. But use those wisely as they are only available in a limited quantities. As expected in this sort of game, a boss awaits for you at the end of each stage and unlocks new powers and weapons when defeated.</plot>

        <plot>Image Fight II Operation Deepstriker is a vertical shooter by Irem and sequel of the arcade game Image Fight originally released in 1988 (and ported to the PC Engine in 1990). Humanity tries to rebuild itself from the aftermath of the first Image Fight - the computer on the moon was destroyed and peace had finally returned. But three years after the attack, a space probe detects unknown objects hurtling towards planet Earth. The signs are clear - a massive alien invasion is underway. After a first encounter around Saturn, Image Fight requires the player to progress through four "simulation stages" - the last six "real stages" can only be accessed if the "simulation" achievement rating is greater enough. Failing this requirements leads to a short but intense Penalty Area. All the primary weapons from the original game are also here for the taking. Up to three colored orbs can be attached to the ship and either fire forwards (blue) or in the opposite way the ship is moving (Red). Secondary devices are also available and can be equipped at the front of the ship - they include all kind of lasers and missiles. However the only way to switch to a different device is to receive a direct hit.</plot>

        <plot>Implode is a homebrew puzzle game. It plays like a falling block puzzle in all respects, with the exception of the fact that the blocks appear from below instead of falling. All the blocks have the same shape and are only distinguished by their color. The player must selects groups of three or more identically colored blocks in order to make them disappear. The goal is to not let the blocks stack up and pass the upper border of the screen. Bombs would sometimes appear and clear out adjacent blocks if the player selects them. The game gradually advances to higher difficulty levels, with more colors and faster speed.</plot>

        <plot>This version of Fray in Magical Adventure differs from the original MSX and subsequent computer releases in several ways. It retains the major events of the story and gameplay mechanics; even though it has more detailed graphics, it still looks too similarly to the original release to be qualified as a remake. The major difference is in the layout of locations and enemies. Some levels are entirely different, even when they are composed of the same elements. For example, the introductory level of the original version is skipped; the subsequent level has a different layout and new enemies. There are more treasure chests in this version's levels, more items, and more areas that require jumping. [CR]This version also has different cut-scenes (for example, the introduction describes some of the events during Fray's study years, which were absent in the original version). The conversations with other characters are longer; certain events are triggered in a different way (such as the necessity to first talk to the guard to trigger the conversation with the mayor in the first town). There is voice acting during important cut-scenes.</plot>

        <plot>Basically, Mami Inoue is a graphic adventure like Shadowgate, except that this one is fucking terrible and focuses primarily on ridiculous poses by then-idol Mami, whose popularity has long since faded. Like many horrible adventures, the game starts with our male hero waking up in bed, because a lot of Japanese designers have this crazy notion that exciting stories should start in the most boring way possible. On the plus side, you get to name your character! You're supposed to give him your own name, because this story is all about you living out some sick twisted fantasy where Mami Inoue is your platonic best friend. That's supposed to be a good thing, but Mami is one really boring girl. But she is a pop idol, so personality doesn't matter. Like it or not, you'll go to school and meet up with some schoolmates, one of whom is the moderately attractive Mami.</plot>

        <plot>Imprisoned by an army of robots on a giant space station, you know there's only one thing you can do - blast your way out. That pretty much sums up the plot of Insanity, the first PC Engine game from homebrew developers Aetherbyte Studios. Insanity is essentially a clone of the classic arcade game Berzerk and retains the straightforward gameplay of the original. You run around the flip-screen play area (whose map layout is randomly generated from a selection of master templates) shooting the robots that are out to get you. The robots are pretty dumb to begin with and often blow themselves up by wandering into the electrified walls, but as you progress they get a little faster and a lot more aggressive, making anticipation and dodging of lasers key skills. The action is accompanied by a selection of retro styled music tracks, giving you the option of CD music or chip generated versions of the same tunes.</plot>

        <plot>It Came from the Desert is a remake of the the original 1989 Amiga game of the same name, but with a vast amount of changes and improvements. The basic setting was kept identical. It is a mix of action and adventure elements, largely inspired from cult-horror B-Movies of the 50's and 60's, and the 1954 film Them in particular. The player plays the part of Dr. Greg Bradley, a geologist and the newest resident in town. Eager to satisfy his scientific mind, Bradley sets out to examine the crash-site of a mysterious meteor, but what he finds is not at all what he had been looking for.</plot>

        <plot>A daughter of the chair of a local high school, Yū Honjō, has been kidnapped by someone unknown. Unable to go to the police, the girl's sister, Mai, hires a private investigator to find out what happened to her. The only piece of evidence is a photograph from the night of Yū's disappearance, where the missing girl and three other students from the same school are playing a game of mahjong.[CR]Jantei Monogatari is a hybrid of a traditional-style Japanese adventure game and a regular mahjong game. The player takes the role of the unnamed private investigator, and moves from place to place via menus, talking to different characters. The investigation happens through playing mahjong with each suspect: win and they'll tell you a bit more of what they know. At first, the investigator can only speak with the three girls in the photo, but as he wins games of mahjong against them, he gains information and experience that allow him to find new clues and talk to more suspects. The investigator will need to play against a dozen different opponents in his attempt to find out what happened to the kidnapped girl.</plot>

        <plot>A direct sequel to Jantei Monogatari 2: Uchū Tantei Divan - Shutsudō-hen, the game continues the overarching plot, following the events of the previous game. The evil alien Dora and his sexy female demonic minions are descending on Earth, sending their subordinates to stop Divan and Marie. Divan must use his robot transformation abilities to defeat them, which can only be done when playing mahjong.[CR]The mahjong gameplay in this installment of the series is identical to that of its predecessor, including points distribution and execution of powerful transformation moves to gain the upper hand in the round. Unlike the previous games in the series, this chapter eschews the rudimentary adventure gameplay, featuring long non-interactive cutscenes between mahjong matches. Another change is the addition of a new mode that allows the player to compete against opponents from the story mode at any time, without going through the story.</plot>

        <plot>Uchū Tantei Divan is a follow-up to Jantei Monogatari, though it can be hardly considered a true sequel because of its entirely new setting and themes. Set in a sci-fi environment, the game casts the player in the role of Divan, a young man who possesses the ability to transform into a powerful supernatural being, and is entrusted by military authorities to protect Earth against an alien demonic attack. This can be done only by defeating the evil minions in mahjong games.[CR]Though featuring elements of a Japanese-style adventure game (verb commands that must be selected from a menu to trigger the next scene), the game focuses on mahjong matches against opponents, which occur as dictated by the plot. The game uses standard mahjong rules, with the exception of bonus powers that can be acquired for points distributed after each round and used in subsequent matches.</plot>

        <plot>The events of Saver Angels take place after those described in the previous installment of the series, when peace on Earth has already been restored thanks to the efforts of Divan and Marie. Three cosmic spirits have lost their way in space and have to descend onto Earth, taking corporeal form. They enter the bodies of three young women who died recently: one in a traffic accident, another from disease, and the third one - a ten-year-old girl - after committing suicide. All three were avid mahjong players, and all three are now revived and endowed with mysterious mahjong powers. A special Mahjong Academy opens, and the Saver Angels (as the group begins calling itself) is ready to defeat any aliens and demons in that ancient Chinese game.[CR]Saver Angels restores adventure elements that were absent from the previous game, and even enhances them. The player is now able to move in first-person perspective by pointing and clicking on a spot on the screen. Exploring locations, the player triggers scenes, which in turn lead to mahjong games. A special "mahjong mode" allows the player to choose an opponent from the story mode and challenge her (or him) to a mahjong match right away.</plot>

        <plot>The first and only Madden game to appear on the TurboGrafx, it features the standard game modes such as exhibition and season and features full-motion video of plays, fans and many other important events happening on and off the field. It also features digitized voices of the quarterbacks, referees and fans, but the most important being the games namesake, John Madden, who lends his voice talent to the game.</plot>

        <plot>This release walks a fine line between an updated version and a full remake of KO Seiki Beast Sanjūshi: Gaia no Fukkatsu. The game follows the same story for the most part, and contains the cut scenes from the original version. Like most PC Engine (TurboGrafx) CD games, it features voice acting during cut scenes and CD audio tracks.[CR]Several cut scenes were added, and some dialogues expanded. Though the story progression and the areas the characters have to traverse in order to advance it remain intact most of the time, the gameplay system has received an overhaul, being essentially developed from scratch. The "RPG-lite" feel of the original version is now somewhat compensated by the ability to equip weapons and armor, as in most RPGs. Combat engine has also been modified; instead of the isometric battle screens of the original, the battles are now viewed from "over-the-shoulder" third-person perspective, with player-controlled characters visibly attacking the foes, similarly to Phantasy Star IV.</plot>

        <plot>[I]Kabuki Ittōryōdan[/I] is set in the Tengai Makyō universe, and is a spin-off of Fūun Kabuki Den. There is no actual story in the game; various characters from [I]Fūun Kabuki Den[/I], headed by the charismatic actor/world-savior Kabuki Danjuro himself, fight each other for no apparent reason - even the "scenario mode" allows the player to choose any of the eight available characters, putting him/her against friends and foes alike, one by one.[CR]The characters are a mixture of protagonists, villains, and support characters from [I]Fūun Kabuki Den's[/I], including the heroes Kabuki, Okuni, and Zeami, as well as the villains Kikugorou and Garp, and - naturally! - the recurrent stupid ape Mantou. [CR]Beside the scenario mode, there is also a Vs. mode, which is basically a two-player mode, allowing two players to fight against each other as any of the eight characters; and a so-called "Life Attack" mode, which randomly chooses AI-controlled opponents for a player-selected character.[CR][I]Kabuki Ittōryōdan[/I] plays like a typical fighting game, the two basic moves being a kick and a punch; other moves are unique for each character and involve strong melee moves or magic-like ranged attacks. For example, Kabuki is able to attack with a sword, while Okuni can set her opponents on fire.</plot>

        <plot>The protagonist of the game was watching a performance by the Japanese singer Noriko Sakai (NORI-P) on TV. Suddenly, the singer was caught in a whirlwind and disappeared. The hero bravely followed her into a magical alternate dimension, but ended up in a forest, unable to find her. He must now find NORI-P and defeat an evil magician in the process.[CR]Kagami no Kuni no Legend is a Japanese-style first-person adventure game. The player interacts with the game world by selecting verb commands from a menu and combining them with objects or characters. Commands such as "Examine" or "Talk" appear at most screens; if an object can be taken, an appropriate command is displayed after the player has thoroughly examined a location. There is also an inventory with items that must be used at specific moments; however, there are no real puzzles in the game. Navigation is done by selecting the "Move" command; in a few locations the player navigates the hero with directional buttons in a pseudo-3D environment. Wrong choices may sometimes lead to a Game Over.[CR]Most of the background and character graphics is done in anime style, with the exception of Noriko herself, who appears in digital photos, sometimes accompanied by song performances.</plot>

The second game was also localized to the US TurboGrafx-CD as Shockman.[CR]Tasuke and Kyapiko are spending a nice relaxing day at the beach, when suddenly a huge spaceship appears overhead! This can only mean one thing... another invasion! Tasuke and Kyapiko suit up and set out to stop it... or is it all just a gross misunderstanding?[CR]Princess Cleha, Bacchi and Choppin: The goofy "antagonists" of the piece.

        <plot>Algunos is a traditional fighting game by Fill-In-Cafe. As expected, the player can either enjoy the game in a solo story mode where the game's plot unfolds as he fights his way through numerous one-on-one encounters, or in Battle mode where he can play against a computer (or friend) controlled enemy. The game counts ten different fighters : Jenius, Asasin, Arcer, Samohan, Greeze, Orga, Lobo, Blocken, Jyobei and Daibuster. Every single one of them has different attacks and set of techniques the player has to learn and master. Controls are fairly simple and straight forward - one button executes a short attack and the other a long attack. If both bottons are pressed, the fighter grabs and throws his enemy in the air. Most of the fighters in Algunos use their bare hands but some also use weapons like swords (which was quite an unusual feature back when the game was published).</plot>

        <plot>This installment in the fishing simulation series, of which the few localized games are known under the River King brand, is a hybrid between two different genres: the trademark fishing and traditional Japanese-style RPG.[CR]The simple story involves, as in many other River King games, a hero and his sister; this time, the sister was about to catch a fish that was essential for their village's prosperity, but hasn't returned. The quest for bigger fish is therefore combined with the quest for the lost sister, and the hero equips weapons and rods to aid him in both tasks...[CR]The RPG part of the game is old-fashioned for the most part, with "world map" navigation, dungeons, towns represented as icons, simple leveling up, etc. Random enemies (mostly animals) pop out on the world map and in dungeons; the battles are presented as simple enemy portraits, without a separate battle screen.[CR]A stand-out feature of the battles is the ability to move around a small dot and aim at the enemies' body parts; depending on where it is aimed, different amounts of damage will be inflicted. It is also possible to miss completely, with the dot wandering outside of the enemy picture.[CR]The fishing simulation part is integrated into the RPG gameplay: in towns, the player can buy fishing accessories (rods, nets, bait, etc.); on the world map, the player can navigate the character onto a river bank and start fishing using available accessories. Fish can be collected, sold, and used for a variety of purposes. A list of available fish with pictures can be viewed directly from the main menu.</plot>

        <plot>Princess Shizuhime has been kidnapped by a group of ninja under the command of Genbu, and brought to the castle of the malevolent Lord Hiei. The brave young ninja Kaze is summoned by Lord Yoshikage and sent on a dangerous mission: infiltrate Hiei's castle, defeat his minions, and rescue Shizuhime.[CR]Kaze Kiri is essentially a beat-em-up with a few distinguishing characteristics. The game consists of traversing fully linear side-scrolling areas, defeating regular enemies and bosses on the way. Before being able to fight the stage boss, Kaze has to vanquish a pre-determined number of enemies, which is displayed as a shared enemy HP on top of the screen.[CR]Kaze attacks with his sword when he is near the enemy, or throws shurikens at them from afar. Enemy projectiles can also be blocked by countering them with shurikens. Kaze can also disappear for a moment and re-appear at another location. He can jump, duck, perform somersaults, and grab and throw enemies. Kaze's health regenerates over time if he is not hit repeatedly. Completing the game unlocks another playable character, the female ninja Suzu.</plot>

        <plot>In Legend of Xanadu, the player controls a young adventurer named Areios. Monsters attack his homeland, and he is forced to flee. After traveling by ship and arriving at the town Bolda, Areios finds out that strange things have been happening in the North Cave near the town. His first mission will be to venture to the North Cave and investigate the matter. Of course, soon Areios finds himself involved in a battle against sinister forces, and commences the longest and most dangerous adventure of his life![CR]The game is an action RPG set in the Dragon Slayer universe, with a gameplay style similar to Falcom's other popular series, Ys. Controlling Areios, the player explores the top-down world, visiting towns and fighting monsters in vast outdoor areas and dungeons. Like in Ys series, it is sufficient to "bump" into a monster in order to inflict damage. Areios gains hit points and becomes stronger by sustaining damage from enemies and resting. His weapons and armor can gain experience and level up. In many areas, companions will join Areios and help him in combat, controlled by the computer AI.[CR]The game is divided into chapters; the final stage of each chapter is a side-scrolling/platform level, which Areios has to navigate in order to reach the boss enemy, defeat him, and end the chapter. In such stages, the combat turns into a more familiar action-oriented style, with the player being required to press buttons in time in order to execute attacks and jump.[CR]There is a day/night cycle in the game, manifested not only in graphical changes, but also in the schedules of townspeople: when it's dark, people will return to their homes and go to sleep, etc.</plot>

        <plot>You take control of a flying robot through seven massive stages. Fight against armies of flying insectoid enemies and other space ships and humanoid robots. The game designs are really similar to early Sunrise animations or Toei classic japanese series like Mazinga Z and Grandizer. Your robot can use different sort of weaponery, from standard blue spreading bullets, to green laser waves and even a sort of 'yoyo' attack. Stages have a standard structure with quite big end of level bosses. Your main weapon can also be charged and trigger a powerful and destructive attack. Use it to finish a boss and unfold a different inbetween level animation sequence !</plot>

        <plot>An evil demon has emerged from the ruins of a sacred temple. A young woman named Erena is persecuted by the militant Hielun Empire, who pursues its own agenda and is convinced that Erena has a mysterious connection to the demon's powers. However, a knight named Vaice and his friends rescue Erena and prepare to defend her, gradually becoming involved in a large-scale armed conflict. [CR][I]Kisō Louga[/I] is a turn-based strategy game. The gameplay consists entirely of battles, with anime-style cutscenes advancing the story between missions. The player navigates individual characters in an overhead locations. A contact with an enemy unit initiates a separate battle, where the player selects commands (Attack, Item, Special, etc.) from a menu. [CR]Castles play an important role during battles: characters can retreat and heal in a player-controlled castle, and conquering an enemy castle is often required as well as part of the mission's objective. Castles may be defended by arches, catapults, etc., and their gates must be destroyed by attacking them. Missions often involve battles between multiple sides. Despite the RPG-like menus, individual statistics, and equipment management, there are no real role-playing elements in the game, since characters do not level up or become stronger in another fashion.</plot>

        <plot>[I]The Ends of Shangrila[/I] is a direct sequel to Kisō Louga. Vaice is on the way to his home country Distoria when he witnesses a group of bandits desecrating a temple. Shortly thereafter he encounters a young woman named Tifire, who describes herself as a fellow Guardian. Vaice and his friends soon draw the ire of a might empire and have to fight for their lives and the destiny of what they hold dear.[CR]The gameplay is similar to that of the previous game, consisting of turn-based battles between Vaice's party and various enemy organizations. Role-playing elements have been enhanced, featuring an experience points system that makes character growth available. Like in the first game, contact with an enemy initiates a separate battle. These battles are more tactical in this installment, taking place on an isometric screen and allowing character movement.</plot>

However, it was a preparatory period for each side to rebuild their exhausted forces and to take new actions. Within the clone camp, a new weapon development project, "Project Siren", has been activated. The system scientifically collects and fixes souls from the human body. The Phantom Medi, a tough machine body, was fixed by the "body separation system" to enable operational actions in the harsh battlefield and environments. Project Siren has been dispatched to Gardova space. This airspace has become a neutral zone due to distrust of both Solone and Vado camps, and it can not be maintained.[CR]What is waiting for Lady Phantom!?</plot>

        <plot>Langrisser (ラングリッサー), known as Warsong in North America, is a tactical role-playing game developed by Nippon Computer Systems (NCS). The first in the Langrisser series, it blended tactical warfare with RPG elements, similar to the Fire Emblem series. It was initially released for the Mega Drive/Genesis console and the PC Engine (in Super CD-ROM² format), the former version being published by Treco in America. The PC-Engine version was released under the title, Langrisser: The Descendants of Light. It was later re-released along Der Langrisser (a remake of Langrisser II) in a compilation for the Sega Saturn and PlayStation. That compilation was released for the PlayStation Network in 2009.</plot>

        <plot>The town Newcam, Massachusetts, 1924. On the outskirts of the town stands the Weathertop mansion. It was just an ordinary place until the last owner, Benedict Weathertop, started practicing black magic. He killed his parents and populated the mansion with all kinds of undead. Since then, nobody dared to approach the mansion. But a short while ago, two boys were found dead near this horrible place. Apparently, the boys had tried to enter the mansion. Another evidence pointed out that a girl followed them - but her body hasn't been found yet, and there is a slight hope she might be alive. This is where you, the hero of the game, decide to investigate the mystery, and to venture into the mansion...[CR]Laplace no Ma (Devil of Laplace) is a Japanese-style RPG with horror elements, somewhat similar to Sweet Home for NES. Unlike Sweet Home, this game is more oriented towards RPG gameplay. You are not stuck in the mansion, but can leave it, visit the town, and buy supplies. Later you also visit other locations such as a castle, etc. The battles are random, turn-based, and are viewed from first-person perspective. The hero of the game can recruit three other characters to the party of five available. Each character (including the hero, to whom you assign gender and class) belongs to one of the five character classes: Dilettante, Medium, Detective, Scientist, or Journalist. Dilettante is an all-around character with defensive magic, Medium is a kind of a black mage, Detective is a melee fighter, Scientist can construct powerful machines to perform various techniques, and the Journalist can take pictures of the monsters, which is the only way to gain money in the game.</plot>

        <plot>In Legend of Xanadu, the player controls a young adventurer named Areios. Monsters attack his homeland, and he is forced to flee. After traveling by ship and arriving at the town Bolda, Areios finds out that strange things have been happening in the North Cave near the town. His first mission will be to venture to the North Cave and investigate the matter. Of course, soon Areios finds himself involved in a battle against sinister forces, and commences the longest and most dangerous adventure of his life![CR]The game is an action RPG set in the Dragon Slayer universe, with a gameplay style similar to Falcom's other popular series, Ys. Controlling Areios, the player explores the top-down world, visiting towns and fighting monsters in vast outdoor areas and dungeons. Like in Ys series, it is sufficient to "bump" into a monster in order to inflict damage. Areios gains hit points and becomes stronger by sustaining damage from enemies and resting. His weapons and armor can gain experience and level up. In many areas, companions will join Areios and help him in combat, controlled by the computer AI.[CR]The game is divided into chapters; the final stage of each chapter is a side-scrolling/platform level, which Areios has to navigate in order to reach the boss enemy, defeat him, and end the chapter. In such stages, the combat turns into a more familiar action-oriented style, with the player being required to press buttons in time in order to execute attacks and jump.[CR]There is a day/night cycle in the game, manifested not only in graphical changes, but also in the schedules of townspeople: when it's dark, people will return to their homes and go to sleep, etc.</plot>

        <plot>Legion is a horizontally scrolling shoot-em-up. The player controls a fighter pilot who defends an unnamed futuristic Empire from an assault of mechanical creatures. In spite of the game's exclusively Japanese release, the protagonist delivers voiced monologues in English, musing over his mission, at the beginning of each stage.[CR]The game has a traditional power-up system with a basic weapon power-up that changes its color rapidly when revealed (red for vulcan gun, green for lasers, blue for missiles), as well as assorted collectible letters that either enhance the strength of the gun with additional shots, add a secondary weapon (such as bombs), or provide the ship with a protective shield. In addition, a powerful all-screen attack can be executed by pressing the second action button. At several points during the game the player is able to choose the next stage among two available ones.</plot>

        <plot>Lemmings is a puzzle-platformer video game originally developed by DMA Design and first published by Psygnosis for the Amiga, Atari ST and PC in 1991. The game was programmed by Mike Dailly and David Jones, and was inspired by a simple animation that Dailly created while experimenting with Deluxe Paint.[CR]The objective of the game is to guide a group of anthropomorphised lemmings through a number of obstacles to a designated exit. To save the required number of lemmings to win, one must determine how to assign a limited number of eight different skills to specific lemmings that allow the selected lemming to alter the landscape, to affect the behaviour of other lemmings, or to clear obstacles to create a safe passage for the rest of the lemmings.[CR]Lemmings was one of the best-received video games of the early 1990s. It was the second highest rated game in the history of Amstrad Action, and was considered the eighth greatest game of all time by Next Generation in 1996. Lemmings is also one of the most widely ported video games, and is estimated to have sold over 15 million copies between its various ports. The popularity of the game also led to the creation of several sequels, remakes and spin-offs, and has also inspired similar games.</plot>

        <plot>Linda³ Again is an esoteric JRPG that combines elements of psychological horror with monster collection. Neo Kenya is the name of a world that is in danger of being completely annihilated by an asteroid. The armies of Neo Kenya have searched for every conceivably way to prevent the coming catastrophe. When the inhabitants of the world turn to a dark god, their prayers and nightmares come true. The game was originally released for the PC-Engine in 1995 under the title of Linda³. Players start the game off with two characters, Linda and Ken.[CR]The story in the game is portrayed through a series of cutscenes, which for the most part are voiced. Action in the game is split up by events that show the deplorable nature of the characters in the face of impending doom.[CR]Three gameplay modes are offered at the beginning, and differ in difficulty and focus.[CR]Capturing monsters is the device used to advanced the plot. The combat in the game plays out similar to Dragon Quest. The combat is represented via text with sprites on the screen representing the enemies. As players capture different monsters, they can use them to give Linda and Ken new abilities and advance the plot. As players wander around the world collecting creatures the time in the game advances in real time. Players only have a set number of gameplay hours to bring as many creatures as possible back to the ship, or Ken and Linda will be left to die on the planet as everyone else evacuates.[CR]The game's story combines psychological elements with voodoo and the occult. The two main characters in the game are Ken, an army soldier tasked with the job of catching monsters; and his girlfriend Linda, who is used by the military as a surrogate for the god's plans. The inhabitants of the Neo Kenya called upon a god by the name of Anubis (a reference to the Egyptian lord of the underworld) in order to protect them from imminent destruction. Apparently answering their calls, the dark god sent an Ark similar to Noah's Ark. He demands that a man and a woman gather two of every animal on the planet. The army nominated Ken and Linda to achieve this task.</plot>

        <plot>Loom is an adventure game that sets itself apart from other titles in the genre through its unique gameplay system: the player character does not carry items around, but rather manipulates objects through the use of spells (called "drafts" in the game). The drafts themselves are woven by playing magical notes on a special instrument called "distaff". All the puzzles in the game are solved by learning and correctly applying these drafts.[CR]Each draft is a sequence of four notes within one octave. The player learns new drafts by exploring the environment and interacting with it through a simple point-and-click interface. Once a draft has been learned, it may be applied in a different situation in order to solve a problem. Drafts range from simple general actions (such as opening) to more specific and complex commands, e.g. turning straw into gold. Drafts can also be "reversed", i.e. played backwards, in order to execute the opposite action (for example, closing something instead of opening). As the game progresses Bobbin learns to play higher notes on the distaff, allowing him to access more drafts.</plot>

        <plot>The boy Rhun and the girl Melvy live in a quiet forest village, both studying the art of magic. They enjoy a peaceful life, learning the secrets of the spirits and magical creatures populating the area. But on one fateful night, everything changes. A horde of goblins invades the village, burning it down. And it looks like the local church is in cohorts with a powerful demon bent on destruction! Before the heroes can realize what is happening, they are forced to escape into the forest, with only their magical powers at their side...[CR][I]Magicoal[/I] is a "pseudo-RPG", i.e. an action-adventure with some minor RPG elements (money, items, etc.), but without an experience system of any kind. It can be played in two-player cooperative mode, controlling Rhun and Melvy, or as a single-player game, choosing one of them and letting the computer AI control the other. The player(s) can switch between the two at any time.[CR]Most of the game is dedicated to exploring top-down areas populated by enemies, and dealing with them in action-based combat, primarily relying on magical spells. While some of the spells have unlimited use, others must be "refilled" with special items found or dropped by the enemies. Rhun and Melvy learn spells unique to each character, of various elemental affinities and general usage (offensive, support, etc.). Money can be collected from enemies as well and then used in shops to buy items.</plot>

The player controls a school principal who brings female students to the hospital to do some tests. The player can then select various hospital rooms on a map; traveling to these locations triggers short conversations, which invariably lead to mahjong games against nurses, schoolgirls, patients, etc. A separate game mode is available, allowing the player to directly compete in mahjong against opponents from the story mode.</plot>

        <plot>In Mahjong on the Beach the player controls a young man in a large coastal city, who meets various scantily clad young women and plays mahjong with them. The player character can be navigated on a top-down map, accessing locations that lead to semi-random encounters with girls and subsequent mahjong games. Winning these games unlocks new locations and allows purchase of items that can be used during the encounters to the player's advantage. In the versus mode the player can directly compete against any of the girls; however, this mode contains only mahjong matches themselves, without any graphical indication as to which opponent the player character is facing.</plot>

        <plot>Makai kara no Tenkōsei is based on the anime series Devil Hunter Yohko. The anime focuses on Yohko Mano, a Japanese high school student who discovers that she is the 108th Devil Hunter, destined to fight supernatural evil beings in accordance with her legacy. The game puts the player in the role of Shoma, a new exchange student who meets Yohko and her best friend Chikako at his new school. Miraculously, the three are teleported into a parallel dimension, and the reluctant hero discovers, to his amazement, that its inhabitants seem to be familiar with him.[CR]The game plays like a typical Japanese-style adventure, with a menu of verb commands (Look, Talk, Think, and Move) at nearly every screen, some leading to object lists. It is often necessary to go through the commands several times to unlock a new one or trigger events. Limited menu-based navigation is also present.</plot>

        <plot>Tooki Yobigoe is a direct sequel to Mamono Hunter Yōko: Makai kara no Tenkōsei, continuing where the story of the previous game left off. Yohko, Shoma and Setsuna are attacked by demons on the flying ship, and have to use their recently found powers to fend them off. As opposed to the previous game, where Shoma was the protagonist, Yohko is the player character in the sequel.[CR]Gameplay-wise, the puzzle-less Japanese adventure format is further utilized. Verb commands must be selected from a menu and sometimes combined with objects or character names for interaction. It is often necessary to repeat commands several times to trigger the next event.</plot>

The entire world is accessible from the start.[CR]The original Macintosh version consists of six black-and-white stacks for the Macintosh's HyperCard software.

        <plot>Martial Champion is a versus fighting game similar in concept to Street Fighter II. There are ten characters to choose from, each representing his or her own country. The main protagonist is a Japanese martial artist named Jin; others include his countryman Zen, a kabuki fighter; a Chinese kung-fu expert and a vampire from Hong-Kong; an Egyptian princess; a scimitar fighter from Saudi Arabia; a spear-wielding Kenyan warrior; a French weapons specialist; and two North Americans - an eyepatched soldier and a blonde female ninja-like fighter. [CR]There are three modes in the game: a tournament mode, in which these characters compete against each other before facing the final boss; a versus mode; and a group fighting mode, in which each player selects several fighters to represent in a series of one-on-one battles. The fighting scheme resembles that of Yie Ar Kung Fu, though with a simplified handling of high, medium, and low attacks. Some of the characters use weapons in battles; it is possible to knock these weapons out of their hands and use them against their owners.</plot>

        <plot>In this game, the player controls a swordsman named Alan. One day he arrives at the village of Flodi, and finds out that his help is needed: the daughter of the village elder, Sophia, has been kidnapped by monsters and taken into the nearby cave. Naturally, rescuing Sophia is just the first quest among the many perils that await the hero on his journey...[CR]La Valeur is a RPG that mostly follows the Japanese format: the hero wanders through the top-down locations, fighting randomly appearing enemies in turn-based combat, gaining money and experience, leveling up automatically, and advancing the story in a linear fashion.[CR]However, there are also some less traditional features in the game. There are three classes of weapons, distinguished by the type of damage they inflict: slashing, piercing, and bludgeoning. Different types of enemies are strong/weak against different classes of weapons. Magic is learned by obtaining keys from wizards in various towns, searching the surrounding areas for treasure chests, retrieving magic rings of different kinds from them, and then bringing them back to the wizard to learn new spells.[CR]The entire quest is played solo, without party members. There is no "world map", which is characteristic for other games of this kind. The gameplay is heavy on "level-grinding"; typically, a certain level must be reach in a given area before the hero is able to defeat the boss enemy. After having reached this level, regular enemies of that area stop giving experience points.</plot>

        <plot>Master of Monsters is a turn-based strategy game in which you choose one of five different wizards and fight the other wizards for domination of the land that stands without a ruler after the master wizard's death. You can play in two campaigns against the computer which requires you to defeat the enemy wizards on all maps and allows you to take all units that have survived a battle into the next one. You can also play all maps individually with up two four human players. In battles, you can summon different monsters and cast spells. Which monsters you can summon and which spells you can use depends on which wizard you have chosen.[CR]Your aim in every battle is to defeat all other wizards and thus conquering the land (In the campaigns you only have a limited number of turns to do so). Your wizard and monsters gain experience from fighting and your monsters' abilities differ largely from one-another. For example some monsters can execute long-range attacks, some have strong magic attacks but are physically weak. Furthermore, their movement is affected by different terrain types. While flying monsters can move freely, most of the other monster have a preferred terrain type (lizards move best in water etc.). You can summon up two 30 monsters per battle, but how many monsters you can summon each turn is not only determined by the amount of MP, but also by the number of towers that you control, which makes conquering and defending towers a key-element in battles.</plot>

        <plot>It was just an ordinary cruise ship gig for the four musicians. The band leader, known only as the Flute (the player names him and the other heroes before the game begins), never thought that it will end in such a way... Suddenly, a tornado engulfed the ship, and the poor musician found himself in the magical world populated by angelic creatures and monsters! Naturally, this world, called Astralius by its inhabitants, needs salvation. Only the Magic Flute can avert a demonic threat. Apparently, our hero is the only flutist in all the dimensions, since it is now his task to take the unlikely role of a noble paladin, find other musicians to help him on his quest, and show everyone that music can, indeed, save the world![CR]Despite the somewhat unusual choice of protagonists, Mateki Densetsu Astralius is quite an "old-school" Japanese-style RPG. The player controls the nameless flutist and other musicians (trumpet player, drummer, etc.), who later join the party, exploring the top-down world, visiting towns to buy weapons, armor, and items, descending into dungeons, automatically leveling up, progressing the story in a linear fashion, and fighting randomly appearing enemies in turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective. Casting magic spells is called "performing" in the game, though it requires magic points, like in other games of this kind. Those magic points must be bought in special shops.[CR]Unlike most other PC Engine (TurboGrafx) CD RPGs, there are no voice overs or animated cut scenes in this game.</plot>

It plays like a traditional top-down Japanese RPG with turn-based combat. Rin-Rin uses magical spells to fight enemies. An unusual feature of the game is the ability to change clothes, and the fact that every dress changes the graphical appearance of the character.</plot>

        <plot>Metal Angel is a managerial simulation game that takes place in the futuristic society of 2014, where battles between fighters in mechanized suits have become a major sports event. The player takes control of a coach who must train five young women of different backgrounds, all of which aspire to become a professional fighter. The coach's statistics are generated by answering a series of questions in the beginning of the game. Each of the girl also has her own statistics that must be carefully monitored. With the exception of automatized events, the game consists of creating schedules for all the girls for one week in advance, and then watching how their attributes change. Activities include battle training, gymnastics, running, resting, etc. All the activities are displayed as small animated segments on the same screen.</plot>

        <plot>The follow-up to Metal Angel is, like its predecessor, a managerial simulation in which the player character trains young girls to become champions of a fighting championship where participants don mechanized power suits. The player controls a manager rather than a coach in this installment, and must keep an eye on the finances as a result. Also, instead of training all the five girls from the first game, the player's answers to the questions posed by the assistant in the beginning of the game determine the choice of the trainee among the same five characters.[CR]The player must make schedules for the fighter, which include various training and recreational activities. The manager can hire coaches with their own programs, or input activities individually. The battles themselves allow little input, with the player being able to choose between various types of attacks by selecting them from a menu; the outcome of the battle largely depends on training and individual statistics.</plot>

        <plot>Sci-fi shoot 'em up.[CR]The following information was kindly provided by Brandon Sheffield of www.insertcredit.com: Metamor Jupiter represents the first (major, he had one previous collaboration) foray into games by musician/designer Masaya Matsuura, of Parappa the Rapper fame. Matsuura, hot off the disbanding of his pop group PSY'S, wrote a vocal song and some incidental music for the game. As for the game itself, it's a rather standard shooter, but is also notable as an early creation of Flight Plan, the developer that went on to create such notable titles as Summon Night, Black/Matrix, Poison Pink, et al. Definitely worth a go if you're a fan of either Matsuura or Flight Plan, and a decent enough, if merely workmanlike effort otherwise. Try it. [CR]I actually bought a copy of this game when last I was in Tokyo, and presented it to Matsuura at his office during an informal interview. He was incredibly surprised to see the game, as he'd lost the original copy of the track, and ripped the disc on the spot in order to get it back! Pretty nifty. Honestly though, I only played it for about 30 minutes. It's really quite ok, but is way more interesting for its history than anything else.</plot>

        <plot>Meteor Blaster DX is a homebrew Asteroids variant. The player controls a spaceship navigated by an astronaut named Stryker, who is sent on a mission to destroy dangerous asteroids in space. There are four different ships to choose from, each with different power and speed ratings. The player can move the ship and rotate its cannon to shoot asteroids. Big and medium asteroids split in two when shot, and only when they are small they can be fully destroyed. A stage is completed when all the asteroids have been eliminated. All the stages take place on the same screen, but feature different enemies and difficulty level. [CR]The DX version is a physical release of a previous download-only version, and includes hostile UFOs that shoot at the player-controlled ship, boss battles, CD audio soundtrack, and power-ups that temporarily grant shields and other bonuses.[CR]Also included on the CD is a timed mode ("Caravan Mode") of Implode, as well as the puzzle game Loop, which was previously only released in emulator-only downloadable format and requires the player to rotate and construct loops out of pipe pieces that gradually fill up the screen, making them disappear.</plot>

        <plot>Minesweeper is a minesweeping game, just like the one included in every copy of Microsoft Windows since ancient times. On a grid, the player clicks in a cell and hopes that it is not occupied with a mine. If it isn't, that cell is filled with a number, which indicates how many mines there are in adjacent cells. Using logical thinking, looking at the relations between different number cells, the player can conclude which cells contain a mine and mark them as such. Once all cells are revealed, the player progresses to the next minefield.[CR]Three main game modes are available, differentiated by the size of the minefield: 9x7, 12x12 and 18x14. Clearing a minefield takes the player to another one of the same size, but with more bombs to clear.[CR]A second mode is a mission mode ("voyage mode" in the PC Engine version), where the player is presented with 10 minefields each in 7 locations around the world. The first ones are very small, only 4x4, growing larger and larger from then on. What is different about the mission mode is that a few cells in the minefield are revealed from the start, putting the player's ability of deduction at test. The editor mode allows players to construct a minefield of their own, by inputting parameters of size and amount of bombs.[CR]The Game Boy version can also be played by two players via a link cable. The PC Engine (TurboGrafx CD) version contains an additional mode entitled "Cook's Quest", in which the player has to help a cook to escape from falling boulders in a cave, represented by mines on a familiar minesweeper field.</plot>

        <plot>Mitsubachi Gakuen is an adventure game in which the player takes the role of a teacher in the Mitsubachi Academy, entrusted with the task of helping its female students to reach stardom by monitoring their studies and activities. The game is divided into four seasons, each with a sub-plot of its own (e.g. preparing to a competition with another school and handling intrusive journalists and possible spies), and each dealing with a team of five different girls. The player can check the dossier of all the twenty students at any time and learn more about them. The game features digitized photos of real people instead of the more common anime-style character graphics.[CR]Gameplay-wise, the game features a traditional menu containing verb commands for examining the environment, talking to characters, checking the inventory, moving to another location, etc.; most of these verbs lead to a list of possible objects to interact with. There are no puzzles, but a few instances require the player to make the right choices in order to continue the game; in other cases it is possible to slightly branch the plot by making a decision.</plot>

        <plot>Wonder Boy III: Monster Lair is a quite different game to most of the games in the Wonder Boy series. You play a green-haired dude who must attack the invaders that attempt to collect weapons and use them to destroy the land. The game starts out like a simple platform game, but it's just when Wonder Boy enters the skull further on that the game is transformed into a shoot 'em up, so basically the gameplay consists of action and shooter scenes.[CR]In the action scenes, your vitality decreases as you make your way towards the skull, but this can be restored by collecting fruit. A wide variety of weapons can be picked up, and not only does these allow you to use the weapons for a limited amount of time, but they also increase your vitality. [CR]In the shooter scenes, you ride your pink friend as you make your way through the scene. Here, your vitality remains static unless you are hit by an enemy passing by. As usual, there is a boss waiting for you at the end which you must defeat. Every boss changes color to show how much damage has been done to it. You have to defeat some bosses in two stages.[CR]If your vitality gets low in each scene, you'll lose a life. You can also choose to have Wonder Girl join you, as two players can play the game.</plot>

        <plot>Hiwako, the daughter of a convenience store owner in a little Japanese town, is just an ordinary Japanese teenager - actually a bit of a spoiled brat. Or so she thought, until one day, a talking bird named Nike (like the Greek goddess of victory, not like the footwear brand) told her that she possessed unique powers that made her transform into the glorious lady warrior Artemis. No, Hiwako didn't stop being a spoiled brat; but as Artemis, it is now her duty to protect her home town from a demonic invasion, and she does not intend to give up.[CR][I]Moonlight Lady[/I] can be called a "pseudo-RPG"; its top-down view and town exploration make it look like a representative of the Japanese branch of this genre, but in reality, it is an action game with light adventure elements and no true role-playing system. [CR]Throughout most of the game, the player controls Artemis and two other heroines (Aquarius and Minerva). Attacking is performed by pressing a button for the lead character's attack, and another for a simultaneous attack by the two other girls. The player can switch the leader at any time. The girls can also charge their attacks to execute more powerful ones.[CR]Regular enemies populate the dungeons, but there is no reward (in the role-playing sense of this word) in defeating them; in fact, the player can try to avoid them altogether and head straight to the boss battle.[CR]A few items can be found and used throughout the game, but there is no real weapon and armor management, nor a financial system of any kind.</plot>

        <plot>In a world where advanced technology and magic co-exist, the Magic Empire controls the vast arid wastelands and the dwellings of mythical creatures. A group of four treasure hunters come across an announcement promising a reward of one million credits to whoever would recover a mysterious purple stone with the engraving of the Empire's crest on it. The four find the artifact relatively quickly, but it is stolen from them by another group with an agenda of their own. Now the heroes must bring the stone back while dealing with the dangerous foes on their way.[CR]Mystic Formula is a top-down shooter. The player navigates the protagonist through hostile environments, shooting at regular enemies and bosses, and avoiding their attacks. The player can choose to control any of the four treasure hunters: a balanced lead character armed with a laser pistol; an elf who shoots fireballs from her staff; an agile female thief; and a sturdy, slow, yet powerful robot. All the characters use ranged attacks that can be upgraded with power-ups. In addition, another type of a power-up brings forth one of the characters from the group to aid the player in combat, controlled by the AI. Two-player mode is available as well.</plot>

        <plot>Nexzr is a vertical shooter by Naxat Soft. In 2012, Earth is once again under attack and a large armada of enemy ships approaches our blue world. The player pilots the Slasher, a powerful space fighter, and prepares to face the oncoming threat. The introduction story is told through a series of fully animated cutscenes and reveals the intricate plot of the game. We learn that stopping the invasion is not our pilot's only goal - he is also on a quest of revenge after a fatal encounter with a large red mecha and the terrible loss, in front of his very eyes, of a close friend and fellow female pilot. He makes his way towards the enemy lines on his own, ready to launch a deadly ambush attack. The Slasher starts its mission with a standard Vulcan gun ("Rapid Shot/Wide Shot") and more weapons are available along the way such as homing flame-lasers ("Guided Fire"), side missiles ("Crawl Missile"), lasers, shields and secondary flying pods ("Funnel"). Unlike most of its peers, Nexzr is as bare as it gets on the weapon/power-up side. It features only one fire button and weapons have a single power level and can't be powered-up, without forgetting the total lack of smart bombs. Interestingly, the option menu offers a special arcade mode that shrinks the screen horizontally and offers a narrower field of view.</plot>

        <plot>In a world where baseball plays a pivotal role in people's lives, teams compete against each for supremacy, using spiritual and magical moves, as well as robots. Recently, a powerful demon took control of the land, and some humans began using the art of baseball for evil purposes. The malevolent Dark Baseballer has been terrorizing innocents, and it is up to a group of young people to restore justice.[CR]Nekketsu Legend Baseballer is a role-playing game dedicated to baseball. There is no actual baseball simulation in the game: much of it plays like a traditional Japanese RPG, with top-down overworld, town and dungeon explorations, party management, leveling up, equipment, items, etc. However, all the usual RPG paraphernalia is completely baseball-themed. Random turn-based battles occur less frequently than in other comparable games, but last a considerable amount of time due to their mechanics: each party member is in control of a group of "baseball robots", and defensive and offensive actions are named after real baseball moves.</plot>

        <plot>Hokutosei no Onna (the title refers to the express train connecting Tokyo and Hokkaido in Japan rather than the Ursa Major constellation) is based on the works of the Japanese detective story writer Kyōtarō Nishimura, starring Inspector Totsugawa and his assistant Kamei, who is the protagonist of the game. A man was found stabbed to death in his apartment in Tokyo; shortly after the investigation begins, another man is killed in a hotel room in Hokkaido. Kamei must question witnesses and suspects and examine evidence in order to solve the mystery.[CR]The gameplay format is that of a Japanese adventure: the player selects verb commands (Examine, Ask, Move, Show, etc.) and combines them with people or objects to gather information and advance the plot. At certain points the interaction switches to point-and-click interface, requiring the player to carefully examine a room or an object, searching for clues.</plot>

        <plot>Lord of Darkness, known in Japan as Bushō Fūun Roku, is the fourth game in the Nobunaga series (but only the third one to have been localized in English). The story of Nobunaga takes place during the Japanese civil war of the 16th century. In a wartime strategy game, 15 different warlords are represented across several territories.[CR]One to eight human players can play, controlling different leaders and factions. Gameplay is done in one of two scenarios; the beginning of the civil war in 1555 or Nobunaga surrounded by his enemies in 1571. Management of population, supplies and military are the gameplay and successful manipulation of these numbers in the right combination to attack and defend against hostile intentions is what will bring your forces to victory.</plot>

        <plot>Long time ago, an evil cosmic entity known as Geios was defeated and sealed for aeons. However, a malevolent alien race has found a way to harvest its power and is now preparing for its reincarnation. Pachinko Planet was attacked, and its king slain. Returning from an interstellar travel, Pachio-kun boards the spacecraft Sledgehammer and embarks on a journey to defeat evil and restore his homeland.[CR][I]Pachio-kun: Warau Uchū[/I] is a pachinko game with a storyline and limited top-down exploration. In most areas, Pachio-kun has to complete one or more pachinko games in order to be able to leave the location and advance the plot. Pachinko machines come in different flavors and difficulty levels. The controls are fairly simple, requiring the player to adjust the strength of the shot; the shots themselves can be fired automatically. The game was shipped with a special controller similar to a real pachinko device.</plot>

The game's plot is rather abstract and serves to tie together various time periods to which the hero travels after completing pachinko-playing sections. In each area there are casinos with pachinko machines. The player can talk to characters in the casino, exchange money for chips and vice versa, and play pachinko on variously themed machines. New areas become accessible after the player has won a sufficient amount of money in the previous casino.</plot>

        <plot>Yū is a young apprentice magician who lives in the Fairy World. One day, a magical error occurs, and Yū finds herself on Earth. In order to return to her world, the little fairy must find three stones that must be inserted into her magical brooch. A young girl who finds the first stone becomes Yū's companion (and the game's protagonist), and together they must find and recover the other stones.[CR]Pastel Lime is a Japanese-style adventure with simple gameplay. Only a few commands (sometimes just one) usually appear on the screen, and the player's input is mostly reduced to selecting these commands several times to trigger the next scene. Sub-menus (such as conversation topics) may appear as well. Game progression is strictly linear, and the player has no choice of selecting locations to travel to.</plot>

        <plot>[I]Digital Comic Patlabor[/I] is based on the anime series [I]Patlabor[/I]. In the near future, officers of Tokyo Metropolitan Police pilot giant robots called "Labors" to combat criminals. Like most installments of the anime and manga, the game focuses on characters from Special Vehicle Section 2, Division 2, and the playable character is Noa Izumi. More specifically, the game follows the so-called "TV timeline", involving the Labor Griffon.[CR]The gameplay is that of a traditional Japanese-style adventure. Three commands — Look, Talk, and Move — appear on every screen. The player selects these commands (there are no sub-menus with objects) to move between locations, examine rooms, talk to characters, and ultimately advance the storyline. The game also contains a variety of features (robot database, interviews with voice actors, etc.) accessible from the main menu, as well as a rock-paper-scissors mini-game starring various Labors.</plot>

        <plot>The Grand Vizier Jaffar has thrown you into a dark dungeon and plans to marry the girl of your dreams in an hour. You're not going to let that happen are you? Try to escape from the dungeon, take out Jaffar's guards, find your way through the Sultan's palace and defeat Jaffar himself. Now go, you've got 60 minutes! Prince of Persia is a 2D platformer with run and jump gameplay. Your hero must avoid deadly traps, solve some simple puzzles and engage in sword fights with the guards. The player has an infinite amount of lives, but has to restart at the beginning of a level each time he dies, and must complete the game within an hour. An especially noteworthy aspect of the game is the very fluent animation of your character.</plot>

But instead of opting for half of the kingdom or the riches of the land, you ask the king for the permission to raise a poor little orphan girl named Maria.[CR]And so the game begins. You are the one who has to build Maria's future. Of course, you can do it in many ways. You can strive to make a real princess out of her, teach her good manners, study arts, to make her a brave fighter like yourself, or just a lazy bimbo who cares for nothing. Her destiny is in your hands!</plot>

        <plot>A hero saved the human race from utter annihilation by the gods. This same hero then was charged by the heavens to take care of young seed dropped from there. This seed becomes his daughter, and her guardian will be watching her progress.[CR]In Princess Maker 2 the player assumes the role of a father to the blessed daughter of the heavens. For the next eight years, the hero will nurture and guide her in the path of the player's own choosing.[CR]It is possible to choose the path of the zodiac-influenced daughter by scheduling her to jobs and schools, which will raise her statistics (strength, combat skills, cooking, faith, etc.) Each month allows the player to designate three different tasks for her to follow. Balancing between character development, stress level, health and financial income is the focus of this game.[CR]Mini sub-quests and various plot options revolve around the young lady adventuring in the wilderness, provided that she's strong enough to tame the wilds. The player can equip her with armor and weapons to fight off wandering random monsters in turn-based combat.[CR]The game starts with the daughter at age ten, from which point the player guides her until her adult years. Choices made during the course of the game will determine her eventual marital status, accomplishments and her relationships with other people. There are 74 unique endings in the game.</plot>

        <plot>Princess Minerva is based on an anime of the same name. In the kingdom of Whistler, the best fighters are young, beautiful women, proficient in many styles of combat. Princess Minerva is one of them. She participates in a tournament, battles against the best female fighters of the country, and ultimately joins forces with them, building a super-powerful party that is bound to defeat the archenemy of the Queen of Whistler, the evil sorceress Dynastar.[CR]The game begins where the girls are already united and are getting ready for the grand quest. Your party contains nine girls, each one with various statistics and magic spells. The large party is divided into three smaller ones, and you switch between them while participating in random battles and fighting bosses. The combat is turn-based, and is viewed from a top-down perspective, like the locations you visit. You travel on the overworld map, visit towns, and descend into dungeons. The three active girls in your party can also unite to perform combo attacks.</plot>

        <plot>Some day in the near future, the crew of an "idol" (a popular culture star) takes a ride on the bus through the countryside. One of the female crew members unexpectedly faints and is taken by her friends into an abandoned mansion discovered nearby. Very soon, however, the accident begins to repeat itself, and evidence of a gruesome murder and possible ghostly presence in the mansion surfaces. Mei Star, an investigator with the team, and her computerized holographic assistant Navi must solve the mystery before it becomes too late.[CR]Private eye dol is an adventure game played for the most part from a top-down perspective. The player navigates Mei around the playable environment, examines places and items of interest, and talks to other characters. With a few exceptions, there are no puzzles in the game, and the plot is advanced by triggering events. On several occasions items must be picked up, but they are used automatically in correspondent locations.</plot>

Commands such as "Look", "Ask" and "Move" must be used on most screens in order to advance the plot. Talking to characters and contemplating about the case play an important role.</plot>

Furuyagi travels to the countryside where he begins to investigate this unusual mystery, determined to find out the truth.[CR]Orgel plays similarly to previous installment in the Psychic Detective series. The bulk of the game is occupied by conversations with characters, which often involve talking about various topics, gathering information. There are no puzzles, but pieces of evidence can be collected, stored, and viewed as inventory items. The interaction with the game world is menu-based.</plot>

        <plot>Psychic Storm is a vertically scrolling shoot-em-up in which the player takes the role of four characters who must protect Neo Hong Kong City from an assault by vicious insectoid aliens. The player can select any of the four characters before each stage. The characters are distinguished by the unique attacks of their ships: Alex uses a vulcan gun, Charr has short-ranged "psychic" beam, Joe has a slow, yet powerful Hell Flame attack, and Nastasia uses ion laser. Each character can also acquire additional weapons by picking regular power-ups.[CR]The game's stand-out feature, however, is its transformation mode. Each of the characters can transform to a larger and much more powerful biomechanical insect-like ship. The transformation can be performed at any time as long as the correspondent bar, which refills itself over the time, is not empty. The bar is reduced rapidly when the character is transformed; special power-ups can be collected from vanquished enemies to extend it temporarily, but once it is depleted the character transforms back to his or her normal form.</plot>

        <plot>Quest of Jongmaster is a mahjong game with role-playing elements. The "RPG mode" follows the story of an apprentice "mahjong warrior", a girl named Chi Fou, who is sent on a quest to defeat monsters that were unleashed on the world. This mode is structured like a traditional medieval top-down RPG, with town and dungeon exploration, NPC interaction, and other familiar elements. The protagonist can equip weapons and armor, cast magic, and purchase healing and status-recovering items. Experience points and money are awarded after each battle.[CR]Random and boss battles in this mode are standard mahjong games, with the addition of special tiles that influence the game's result, e.g. increase the damage inflicted by the equipped weapon. The final damage is calculated after the mahjong game is over, and depends on the characters' levels, equipment, and the winning combination. For example, winning the game with a full mahjong would most likely result in a "critical hit". Boss enemies typically take two or more rounds of mahjong to defeat.[CR]In addition, the game features a versus mode, which allows the player to compete in mahjong games against the opponents of the RPG mode, with weapons, equipment, and level parameters playing no role. These opponents appear as monsters at first, but are revealed to be pretty young women who remove parts of their clothes when losing a mahjong round; stripping down to underwear equals defeat. Despite this feature, there is no explicit nudity in the game.</plot>

        <plot>Quiz Avenue is a trivia game with a "quest mode" in which the player controls a warrior who must save the princess Questine from the clutches of evil Shameless, the enemies of the Erudition kingdom. The player navigates the hero on small boards with branching paths; each point of interest represents a quiz "battle" against a monster, culminating in a "boss battle" on the final stage, where the player is able to select the topic of the questions (e.g. geography, movies, English language, etc.). Quiz encounters vary in length and amount of answers to choose from, but always have a time limit for each question. In addition, a separate "party mode" allows players to compete in trivia games, each consisting of three or five rounds.</plot>

        <plot>Quiz Avenue II, like its predecessor, is a quiz game with a story-driven quest mode, which continues the plot of the first game. After the evil Shameless were vanquished, peace was restored in the kingdom of Erudition; however, soon demonic forces appeared on the horizon, and two young warriors, one boy and one girl, were sent by the queen to stop them.[CR]The quiz rules in this installment are largely the same as in the previous entry, with three or four answers to choose for each question and a time limit. The board advancement, however, is determined by choosing cards with the amount of steps written on them rather than by dot-to-dot movement of the first game. New is the two-player mode for the quest, in which the second player controls the heroine, and the two are answering questions simultaneously. A few new features, such as the possibility to acquire various bonuses before a quiz encounter, have been added. The party mode is replaced by the so-called "F1 Grand Prix", which is a series of trivia questions where each round is presented as a Formula 1 race.</plot>

        <plot>Quiz Avenue III offers, like its two predecessors, a quest mode and a versus mode - the latter consists in this installment of a series of trivia questions for up to eight players (controlling a variety of tough-looking fighters), with rounds disguised as fighting games, each wrong answer leading to a loss of hit points. The main difference between this entry and the previous ones lies in the quest mode and its RPG elements.[CR]Like a full-fledged role-playing game, the quest mode has leveling up, free top-down navigation, overworld, towns, dungeons, monetary system, weapons, armor, items, and even companions who join the main heroine, a girl named Konoha, who was raised by an old fighter and has to use her special abilities to rid the land of monsters. Battles occur randomly; the player has the choice to try to escape before the battle begins. Each enemy asks a row of trivia questions; correct answers damage the enemy and eventually defeat him, while wrong answers deplete the HP of the controllable characters. Levels, weapons, armor and items contribute to the damage equation, raising or lowering the amount of questions needed to answer correctly in order to prevail.</plot>

The main mode involves a quiz competition in which players can choose the topics of the questions, e.g. movies, video games, history, etc. Up to five players can participate in this mode or compete against the computer AI.[CR]The "adventure mode" is a board game in which the player-controlled character's movement is determined by a dice roll. Normal fields lead to short quiz encounters; other fields may enhance the protagonist's hit points, and the final field on each stage is a more challenging "boss battle".[CR]Time attack mode involves answering correctly as many questions as possible within the allotted time limit. Finally, versus mode has players competing against each other; every right answer advances the character on a board, while the opponent is pushed back. All modes feature characters from other games published by Hudson Soft, such as Bomberman or Tengai Makyō series.</plot>

        <plot>Time Machie ni Onegai differs from its predecessor by having its own unique gameplay modes rather than strictly following a TV game show format. The Time Machine mode involves traveling to different time periods and answering trivia questions in order to trigger famous events (e.g. Moses creating a path through the Red Sea for the Jews, the belligerents of the Three Kingdoms era attacking each other, apple falling on Sir Isaac Newton's head, etc.). The questions themselves, however, have usually nothing to do with the historical event in question.[CR]Another mode in the game is called "Megaten Quest"; however, it is not a Megami Tensei related quiz, but rather an imitation of a first-person dungeon crawler with randomly appearing enemies who ask the player a certain number of question on various themes. The third mode follows the same quiz format with correctly answered questions leading to puzzle solutions, and is essentially the multiplayer portion of the game. In all modes, time limit is imposed on the entire round rather than on separate questions.</plot>

The plot involves a kidnapping of a little girl by the mafia, and the attempts of a boy named Hoshimaru to rescue her, all the while escaping from an impending apocalypse. Hoshimaru can be navigated over a board (often with branching paths); each field usually leads to a conversation scene with a following quiz. Both Hoshimaru and the "enemies" have life bars; the protagonist's health increases after successfully completed quiz challenges. Correct answers damage the enemy, while wrong answers deplete the hero's life. The amount of possible answer to select from and the nature of trivia questions varies from quest to quest.[CR]Other modes include a multiplayer tournament, a time attack mode in which players have to answer as many questions as possible within a time limit, and two multiplayer modes that allows players to represent various characters and mimic a fighting game and a Formula 1 Grand Prix.</plot>

        <plot>The first Ranma 1/2 game based on Rumiko Takahashi’s popular manga. You play Ranma, a boy who after falling in a magical hot spring, changes into a girl if he gets wet. The only way to change back is to come into contact with hot water. The large cast of supporting characters includes many shape changing people, including a panda, cat and goose! The game itself is a scrolling beat ‘em up (with some one-on-one stages) with a major focus on the visual scenes between levels that tell the story from the manga.</plot>

        <plot>The title translates to "Overthrow of the Indiscriminate Fighting Style." This is a side-scrolling fighting game similar to Final Fight and is similar to the first PC Engine game. The storyline goes up to the Hiryu Shoten Ha storyline where Ranma must battle against many of his arch rivals. After each stage you can see one of two cut scenes depending on the sex Ranma is when he beats the stage.</plot>

        <rom name="chd_pcecd/CHD-PCECD/Ranma 1-2 - Toraware no Hanayome (Japan).chd" size="112430355"/>
        <plot>Based on the Ranma 1/2 manga and anime series, Toraware no Hanayome consists of several chapters, which are similar to episodes of a TV show: each one has its own story and theme, but all the chapters have recurrent characters from the Ranma 1/2 universe. As in the original manga and anime, the story focuses on the young martial artist and high school student Ranma, who was cursed after bathing in a sacred Chinese spring: contact with cold water turns him into a woman, while hot water restores him to his original masculine form. Most of the story in the game is dedicated to Ranma's relationships with his schoolmates and other characters, often involving comic and/or romantic situations, as well as Ranma's attempts to get rid of the curse: in the first chapter, he tries to win a contest that would allow him to travel to China and find a way to turn him into a man permanently.[CR]Unlike most other Ranma 1/2 iterations, this game is a so-called "digital comic", which is the same as Japanese-style adventure. Controlling Ranma, the player interacts with the environment by selecting verb commands ("Look", "Talk", etc.) and objects from sub-menus. The navigation is also menu-based. Animated cut scenes appear frequently to advance the story.</plot>

        <rom name="chd_pcecd/CHD-PCECD/Record of Lodoss War (Japan).chd" size="91180017"/>
        <plot>The game is based on the novel cycle Record of Lodoss War by Ryo Mizuno, and more closely on subsequent manga volumes and OVA series. Its story generally follows the one of the OVA, the main hero being Parn, a young man who grows up in a small village and later becomes one of the strongest warriors in the world, thanks to his father's mysterious heritage and his own courage. Like in the anime series, the game begins with a goblin attack and with Parn leaving his home village together with his best friend Etoh in search of adventure.[CR]This version of Record of Lodoss War is a traditional Japanese RPG with top-down world map navigation and random battles. There is a strategic element in the battles, allowing the characters to freely move on the battle field. However, the battles can be set on auto, making them more fast-paced and similar to traditional Japanese RPG combat. The towns have menu-based first-person view navigation.</plot>

        <plot>Road Spirits is an arcade-style racing game, similar to Rad Racer. The player controls a car from an "into the screen" 3rd person perspective, racing through the 17 pseudo-3D courses (named after various geographical locations, e.g. "West Coast" etc.). There are other cars on the road, which can slow down the player-controlled car by colliding with it, but the race is against time rather than against these cars. The player is given a time limit for each course, and an indicator shows how close the car is to the completion. Should the car run out of time, the race is lost, and the player has to replay it before tackling the next one.[CR]The car can be controlled with two buttons only; collisions do not damage the car, but merely make it stop; though the player can change a car model and gear system, no realistic gear-based driving is used in the game. All this contribute to the overall arcade feeling of the races.</plot>

        <plot>Long time ago, a thriving civilization blessed by the gods was ruined as a result of a perpetual war. Humanity has built a new civilization, which resembles a medieval world. The young swordsman Jan lives In the kingdom of Cordelia. One fine day he and Ortena, the daughter of the High Priest, go on a treasure hunt. When they return, they find the country overrun by monsters; Ortena's father is killed, and the princess of Cordelia has been kidnapped. The two team up with a legendary hero, in order to rescue those who can still be rescued, and fulfill the legacy of the gods...[CR]Ruin: Kami no Isan is an action RPG. The player navigates Jan through top-down towns and hostile areas; the "world map" is not free-roaming, allowing only linear advancement from location to location. Hostile areas are populated by enemies who are visibly walking on screen.</plot>

        <plot>Sangokushi: Eiketsu Tenka ni Nozomu is a turn-based historical strategy game set in the Three Kingdoms era of the Chinese history and similar in concept and gameplay to Romance of the Three Kingdoms series, albeit with somewhat simpler gameplay. There is no scenario selection, and the exact timeline is not specified, though the initial situation corresponds to the phase of the war when Liu Bei and Cao Cao were the principal opposing forces. Players can choose to control any of the six most renowned warlords of the time, Liu Bei being the "default" player character with his own extended introduction and personal motives reminiscent of Luo Guanzhong's novelization of the historical events.[CR]Each warlord tries to gain dominance by building up diplomatic relationships and invading other provinces. It is possible to send offerings and diplomatic missions to other rulers, as well as manage army commanders, finances, and provision. Invasions take place on a tactical hexagonal grid, on which the player positions his forces and navigates them in turn-based fashion. When opponents meet on adjacent fields an automatic battle sequence ensues.</plot>

        <plot>In a medieval land where a country's power and prosperity depended on mahjong-playing skills of its inhabitants, the Darol army began an invasion campaign, aided by demonic forces. The Kingdom of Rida was conquered. The young royal guard Biares fought valiantly, but was unable to defeat his mysterious opponent in mahjong. He was teleported far away, and found by a girl named Olivie. Biares has to find a way to return to Rida and liberate his country from invaders, finding companions and playing mahjong on the way.[CR]Seisenshi Denshō: Jantaku no Kishi is a mahjong game. The story mode features extensive cutscenes and dialogue between mahjong matches. Mahjong gameplay itself is of the one-on-one variety; a few rules regarding combinations and bonuses can be customized. The free mode allows the player to match Biares against various characters encountered in the story mode.</plot>

        <plot>A mysterious young woman with a baby was attacked during the Holy Night. She managed to escape, but collapsed and died in front of the church in the city of Yalem. But the baby survived, grew up, and eventually became a hero on a quest to avenge his mother's murderers and save the world.[CR]Seiya Monogatari: Anearth Fantasy Stories differs from most other role-playing games in several important aspects. The player creates the main character in a unique way: when the baby lies on the snow outside of the church, several people pass by. The player can choose to press the action button, making the baby cry and attracting the attention of these people.

        <plot>A mysterious young woman with a baby was attacked during the Holy Night. She managed to escape, but collapsed and died in front of the church in the city of Yalem. But the baby survived, grew up, and eventually became a hero on a quest to avenge his mother's murderers and save the world.[CR]Seiya Monogatari: Anearth Fantasy Stories differs from most other role-playing games in several important aspects. The player creates the main character in a unique way: when the baby lies on the snow outside of the church, several people pass by. The player can choose to press the action button, making the baby cry and attracting the attention of these people. Depending on the timing of this "baby action", the hero will be adopted by different people, which make him belong to a different character class (fighter, thief, mage, or monk), and also lead to four entirely different prologues (once the hero turns fifteen, the four stories eventually merge into one).[CR]Instead of random battles - or even regular battles with wandering enemies - the game has pre-set battles, which occur much less frequently than in traditional Japanese RPGs.

        <plot>Sengoku Kantō Sangokushi is a turn-based historical strategy game set during the Sengoku period of the Japanese history. The player can take control of one of the three prominent warlords of the era: Uesugi Kenshin, Hōjō Ujiyasu, or Takeda Shingen. Each warlord initially controls a province with several towns, and tries to win over territory by diplomatic or military means. Every turn the player has a limited amount of moves at his or her disposal; every general has his own options, though some (e.g. marriage) are restricted to the main warlord himself.[CR]Each town has to survive and raise reputation by maintaining an army and keeping the population happy. This is achieved by trading (buying and selling rice), giving money to civilians or soldiers, developing the town, etc. Every general can also strike alliances with rulers of other provinces, sign agreements, and send spies.[CR]When an area controlled by a general is invaded by the enemy, the game switches into a top-down turn-based tactical battle mode. The player positions and navigates soldiers, engaging in automatic battles when the opponents meet on adjacent squares. Castle invasion and defense can be carried out through various means: for example, it is possible to send an assassin to dispose of the enemy general, or assign archers to fend off the invaders from castle walls.</plot>

        <plot>Sexy Idol Mahjong is, as its title implies, a mahjong game starring popular Japanese female singers and TV personalities. In the game's background plot, they are the so-called "demonic women", ruled by a nearly immortal queen residing in a castle. The player takes the role of a medieval knight who must defeat these women by playing mahjong against them. The player character automatically moves on an overhead map and plays mahjong rounds against the women in a linear fashion. Defeating these opponents may reward the player with their digitized photos, usually featuring scanty clothes and seductive poses.</plot>

        <plot>Fashion Monogatari is, like its predecessor, a mahjong game featuring digitized photos of Japanese female "idols". Gameplay-wise, however, this installment is quite different: it is a board game in which the player navigates a character by throwing dice to determine the number of moves. Like in other games of this genre, some fields bestow benefits on the player (e.g. award him money or items, invite the player to participate in bonus games, etc.). Most fields, however, lead to mahjong rounds against digitized young women, which have to be won in order to advance. Photos of scantily clad women in seductive poses serve as a reward for victory. A four-player mahjong mode is also available.</plot>

        <plot>Yakyūken no Uta is, like other games in the series, a mahjong game featuring digitized photos of Japanese actresses. There is no story in the game; players can simply choose to compete either in four- or two-player mahjong tournaments, selecting individual participants or teams from a list. The game also contains a third mode which has nothing to do with mahjong: players select actresses who then begin to dance; players have to press buttons at the right moment to execute dancing moves. Actresses appear topless in these dances.</plot>

        <plot>The Dark Ones have captured the Ring of Five and imprisoned the wizards that guard it. A barbarian named Lykos has the power to transform into different creatures. He needs to rescue the wizards and the Ring of Five from the Dark Ones before they invade his home, Krellion.[CR]Shape Shifter is a side-scrolling action game with platforming and light role-playing elements. Much of the game consists of traversing hostile areas, fighting regular enemies on the way and defeating bosses. The game's "hub" area is a town where Lykos can replenish his health and buy any of the three available weapons (axe, mace, or bow). These weapons can be upgraded by enchanting them or picking up power-ups.[CR]After Lykos rescues a wizard he gains access to a transformation power. Transformations require special gems and cannot be performed if Lykos runs out of them. There are four transformations in the game: the panther can jump over large gaps; the shark can swim; the golem can jump higher; and the golden dragon can fly. Each of these forms can also collect power-ups that unlocks a few other attack abilities.[CR]The game's stages are interconnected, but usually a new form must be acquired before Lykos can access a new area. Lykos has eight lives consisting of smaller health units (hearts). The game can only be saved in the town.</plot>

        <plot>The game uses live actors and sets as the player controls Sherlock Holmes and his longtime partner Dr. Watson, trying to solve three separate crimes by visiting various locations, listening to the dialogue, reading the included mock London newspapers, and, when the player gets enough evidence, answering the judge's questions.[CR]At the beginning of each case a full motion video clip depicts Holmes and Watson meeting a client and learning a few background clues about the case. Then the player must visit a particular location or person, read the London newspapers for clues or ask one of the young Baker Street Irregulars to investigate. The object of each case is to gather enough clues in the shortest time possible, then go before a judge who will then ask the player to answer the important questions about the case. If the player is successful, a full motion video clip will take the player back to Holmes' and Watson's study where they will review the events that transpired, and Dr. Watson will inform the player of his or her score, based on the length of time it took to solve the case.</plot>

        <plot>The game uses live actors and sets as the player controls Sherlock Holmes and his longtime partner Dr. Watson, trying to solve three separate crimes by visiting various locations, listening to the dialogue, reading the included mock London newspapers, and, when the player gets enough evidence, answering the judge's questions.[CR]At the beginning of each case a full motion video clip depicts Holmes and Watson meeting a client and learning a few background clues about the case. Then the player must visit a particular location or person, read the London newspapers for clues or ask one of the young Baker Street Irregulars to investigate. The object of each case is to gather enough clues in the shortest time possible, then go before a judge who will then ask the player to answer the important questions about the case. If the player is successful, a full motion video clip will take the player back to Holmes' and Watson's study where they will review the events that transpired, and Dr. Watson will inform the player of his or her score, based on the length of time it took to solve the case.</plot>

        <plot>A young man lives together with his mother in Kichijoji, a district in modern Tokyo. One day, he has a strange dream: he is being sucked into another dimension, a strange maze-like structure. A spirit appears in front of him and asks him his name. As he proceeds further, he meets a man who is hanging on a cross, another one who is being tormented by a demon, and a mysterious young woman who is bathing in a pool.[CR]"Wake up!" - the voice of his mother cuts through the dream. The young man wakes up and checks his computer. Suddenly, a message arrives: the world is headed towards destruction. Only he who can summon demons through a virtual space will be able to prevent a disaster. Unable to understand what that means, the young man goes outside and finds out a murder has occurred in the nearby park. The district must be cut off from the rest of the city until the murderer is found. As the young man acquires a device that allows him to communicate with demons, he begins to realize that his role in the upcoming events may be greater than he thought.</plot>

        <plot>Shin Onryō Senki is a remake of Onryō Senki. The story and most of the dialogues remain the same as in the original release; gameplay-wise, the versions are also nearly identical, utilizing the same menu-based verb-object commands. The differences lie mostly in visual presentation and technical quality of the music. The graphics are by far more technically advanced; most locations have been re-drawn from scratch. Digitized photos are used to represent some of the characters, and anime-like style is less pronounced. Many locations and scenes have been expanded, with additional close-ups, different angles, etc. A few locations have been added or made accessible at different moments during the course of the game.</plot>

No, those are not names of months, but five beautiful ladies, who can handle some high-tech weaponry and who think only about treasure. But the five lovely pirates are not evil - whenever some tyrant threatens a planet, they are there to help.[CR]The gameplay of Sol Bianca is that of a traditional Japanese-style RPG.

The valiant swordsman Soleil lives in the capital city, and the king entrusts him with the task of protecting the two Moon goddesses, and retrieving the Sun Sword, which are necessarily to prevent a magician known as Silver to use the Gears of Fate for his evil purposes...[CR]Sol Moonarge is a traditional Japanese-style RPG. As in most games of this genre, the player navigates the main hero and his companions on the top-down "world map", entering towns to buy weapons, armor, and items, as well as hostile locations which are necessary to complete to advance the plot in a linear fashion. Enemy encounters are random; combat is turn-based and viewed from first-person perspective.[CR]As in most Japanese RPGs, the characters level up automatically, after having accumulated a set amount of experience points; specific weapon and magic proficiencies, however, grow depending on the amount of times player-controlled characters use that particular type of weapon or spell.[CR]There is a day-night cycle (on the world map only), which influences people's schedules: at night the shops are closed, but certain characters might appear only during that time.</plot>

        <plot>[I]Solid Force[/I] is a turn-based strategy game that casts the player in the role of Sho Masaki, a member of an organization known as "Mars". The group consists of highly trained agents and specializes in performing classified missions for various countries. Sho's first mission is to infiltrate a base in East Africa at the request of the African Federation.[CR]The game is composed out of large-scaled tactical battles. The player navigates the combatants over the screen and tries to accomplish missions without having the main hero killed. Most of the attacks in the game are ranged, and each weapon has unique properties. It is possible to choose full or spreading attacks with many firearms, throw bombs and use special abilities. Weapons have limited ammunition, and must be equipped manually before using. Powerful area attacks can be executed, but they damage everyone in the area, including player-controlled characters. Robot-like machines can be controlled directly by the player or set on auto mode.</plot>

The king of Pentawa hires a party of adventurers, and their first assignment is to retrieve a precious sceptre from a dungeon, where it is guarded by the evil demonic lord Ouks.[CR]The game is an RPG with an unusual side-scrolling perspective and action-based combat, somewhat of a cross between Wizardry and platform games. Despite being a Japanese game, Sorcerian resembles Western RPGs of its time, focusing more on character development than story. In the beginning, the player creates a party of four characters, choosing between fighter, wizard, elf, and dwarf (races and classes are not distinguished). Beside the usual inns and shops, there are many things that can be done in the towns of the game, including complex development of magical spells (up to 120 spells of different disciplines), training to raise personal skills (strength, intelligence, etc.), enchanting weapons with elemental magic, as well as looking for part-time jobs.[CR]The view switches to side-scrolling when the party ventures into a hostile area. Combat is performed in real time, with the player controlling the entire party at once. The lead character can be changed at any time, and battle actions will be carried out by whoever is in front. Melee attacks and magic spells are unleashed by pressing corresponding buttons. The characters can also jump and interact with objects by bumping into them. Dungeons are usually maze-like, and some contain simple puzzles such as finding and activating hidden switches to open doors.</plot>

        <plot>Sotsugyō is the first game in the series, released only in Japan. It puts the player into a position of a high school teacher, whose goal is to successfully lead five female students to graduation within the same semester. In order to do that, the player has to study the individual characteristics of the girls. Each girl has different parameters, different strengths and weaknesses. The teacher should be careful not to overload the students with work, but letting them do what they want is not the right way either. The teacher has also control on other aspects of the students' life: it is possible to have personal conversations with the girls to motivate them, and choose leisure activities for them (such as going to the cinema). The girls can become displeased with the teacher or sick, so it's important to keep the morale high in order to achieve successful graduation.</plot>

        <plot>Graduation is a Japanese anime "life-sim" game. You take the role of a homeroom teacher who is given the responsibility of teaching five girls in their last year of high school. You determine their class schedules, do guidance counseling, interfere with their weekend plans, and occasionally take to the streets to make sure they're not getting into trouble. Each of the girls have their own individual personality and problems, and the choices you make will determine whether they graduate from high school, what they do with their lives afterwards, and whether or not they wind up hating your guts. Get them all into top colleges and your boss will praise your genius. If they all flunk or wind up wanting to marry you, you'll obviously be fired.[CR]Despite what common sense and knowledge of the Japanese psyche might lead you to believe, this is not an adult (or hentai) game and there's no nudity and only an average amount of anime sexploitation.</plot>

        <plot>This enhanced version of the earlier computer release allows the player to play either of the games directly from the main menu. Both games feature some re-drawn artwork and remixed soundtrack, as well as voice-overs that were not present in the computer versions. The protagonists' names have been changed to Naoki Muraoka (Sotsugyō Shashin) and Tetsuya Watanabe (Miki).[CR]While the gameplay of Miki remains largely unchanged, this version of Sotsugyō Shashin allows the player to choose Hiromi Kamura as the protagonist, which adds a second scenario to the game where the same events are presented from her point of view. The gameplay system has underwent a few tweaks, making some of the player's choices influence the course of the story. While the original game only had one ending, this version has seven endings for Naoki's scenario and ten for Hiromi's.</plot>

What remains is the classic mode that allows the player to choose the type of arcade cabinet (upright, black and white, etc.) as background to the action as well as the versus mode for two players. The versus mode is split-screen, each player trying to survive and eliminate more invaders than the opponent.[CR]The PC Engine (TurboGrafx) CD version offers an additional "cosmic versus" mode, where the background is composed of anime-style pictures of girls. They also appear in the "omake mode", which is a single-player variant with the same backgrounds.</plot>

        <plot>In the future, mankind has learned to navigate space ships. Human beings spread out to different planets of the Milky Way. The hero of the game is a young pilot named Harry. He was testing the newest spacecraft model, but it crash-landed on Menaris, a planet at the outskirts of the Eva solar system, with a medieval-like civilization. Turns out that repairing the ship will be anything but easy, so Harry decides to stay for a while and to help the inhabitants of Menaris with their problems, which involve the over-ambitious Doran Empire. With the help of Aria, princess of Menaris, Harry must discover the truth about Doran's intentions, and when he learns it, he realizes that he won't use the repaired ship to return home, but will have to face something that threatens the entire galaxy.[CR]Star Breaker is a fairly traditional Japanese RPG, with top-down view, world map navigation, random turn-based battles, and all the other usual ingredients. Battles can be set on Auto for quicker pacing. Since the setting of the game is a mixture of sci-fi and medieval fantasy, character use a variety of weapons from swords to guns, as well as special psychic attacks. There are also some space ship combat in the game, and it is possible to upgrade the player's ship later on.</plot>

        <plot>Star Mobile is a real-time puzzle game. A large scale is displayed on the screen, and stars continuously fall on it from above. The goal is to move the stars horizontally as they are falling in such a way that the weight on the scale is balance. Each stage contains a set amount of stars required for the player to handle. Stars come in different colors that represent their weight. Both right and left side of the scale contain several spots where the stars can land. If there are too many stars on the same spot, they will fall down, greatly decreasing the weight on the side they were in.</plot>

        <rom name="chd_pcecd/CHD-PCECD/Star Parodier (Japan).chd" size="377728378"/>
        <plot>Star Parodier is a vertical scrolling shooter, much like the Star Soldier games, and features many of the same conventions, such as collecting power-ups to upgrade the player's weapons, and facing several bosses and minibosses as they progress through the game. The game also features the 2 and 5 minute high score time attack modes seen in previous games.[CR]However, in parodying the hard sci-fi atmosphere of the Star Soldier games, Star Parodier takes a light hearted approach by featuring cute, cartoonish graphics and toning down the violence (for example, defeated enemies wave white flags in surrender). The players choose from one of three craft to play as in the game: the Paro Ceaser from Star Soldier, a giant flying Bomberman or an anthropomorphic PC Engine console that shoots HuCards and CD-ROMs at enemies.[CR]The game was originally only released in Japan, though it was also intended to be released in North America under the name Fantasy Star Soldier.</plot>

        <plot>In Startling Odyssey, the player takes the role of a young boy named Leon. One day, his home villages is attacked by monsters. His best friend is killed, and the most powerful magician of the village is turned into stone and abducted by the monsters' leader. Leon receives the blessing of the village elder and begins his quest to avenge the death of his friend and to defeat the demonic forces that threaten the land.[CR]The game is a rather traditional Japanese RPG, with all the familiar ingredients: Leon (and his companions who later join the party) roams the world map, entering towns and dungeons, buying equipment and items, and engaging randomly appearing enemies in turn-based combat. The battles are viewed from first-person perspective. Characters can use regular attacks as well as magical spells, and the battles can be also set on Auto.</plot>

        <plot>Strider, released in Japan as Strider Hiryū (ストライダー飛竜?) is a 1989 side-scrolling platform game released for the CP System arcade hardware by Capcom. It became one of Capcom's early hits before Street Fighter II, revered for its innovative gameplay and multilingual voice clips during cutscenes (presented in English, Japanese, Mandarin, Russian and Spanish). [CR]Strider is set in a dystopian future in the year 2048, where a mysterious dictator known as the "Grandmaster" rules over the world. Hiryu, the youngest ever Super A Ranked[2] member of a organization of high-tech ninja-like agents known as the "Striders", is alone tasked with the Grandmaster's assassination. Hiryu begins his mission by infiltrating the Grandmaster's capital at the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic. [CR]NEC Avenue produced a PC Engine version of Strider Hiryu, which was released exclusively in Japan on September 22, 1994. The PC Engine version was released as a CD-ROM² title which requires the Arcade Card expansion. The PC Engine port features an all-new desert stage that was not in the arcade version, as well as newly recorded cut-scenes, music and dialogue, with Japanese voice actor Kaneto Shiozawa as the voice of Hiryu and Kōji Totani as the Grand Master. The PC Engine version is notable for its long development process, having been planned in various formats, including the ill-fated SuperGrafx at one point</plot>

        <plot>Nariagari Trendy is an adaptation of the Japanese board game sugoroku - the Monopoly-like "Game of Life" version rather than the backgammon variant. Four characters, controlled by human players or computer AI, move on a board that represents a city, earning money and points on the way. The characters are taken from other Laser Soft games, most prominently Cosmic Fantasy series. The amount of moves is determined by dice roll. Special fields would award the character that lands on them with large amounts of money, the opportunity to roll the dice again, or lead to various mini-games which would increase the character's possessions. Another type of fields leads to a store run by the cat Nyan from Cosmic Fantasy games, who offers special cards for money.</plot>

        <plot>Alzadick is a vertically-scrolling sci-fi shoot-em-up designed for Naxat Soft's Summer Carnival of 1992, a game competition similar to Hudson's Caravan Tournament. The game specifically focuses on beating high scores, and as such introduces Score Attack and Time Attack modes, both short segments of shoot-em-up gameplay that challenge players to reach a high score (in case of Time Attack, within a limited amount of time). There is also a story mode split into two episodes (both based on sci-fi-themed futuristic scenarios); however, there is no actual plot development in-game, and the episodes are very short compared to standard-length shooters.[CR]Like in most games of the kind, the player controls a spaceship and tries to eliminate or avoid on-screen enemies. Power-ups take the shape of the letters A, B, C, and D; each corresponds to a weapon of specific color and properties (e.g. spreading fire, side fire, etc.), though they are fairly similar to each other in function. A powerful sub-weapon that hits all enemies on screen comes in four variants and can only be used once.</plot>

        <plot>Released specifically for Naxat Soft's Summer Carnival of 1993, Nexzr Special is a collection of short stages and modes that share their basic gameplay system and visuals with Nexzr. The regular mode introduces familiar regular enemies and a few new bosses. The "Carnival Mode" contains Score Attack and Time Attack modes, both requiring the player to focus on attaining the high score rather than just surviving. For that reason the difficulty in these modes is more forgiving; they allow more continues and have more generously placed power-ups. These modes also offer more destructible objects on the screen, as these specifically serve to increase the score.</plot>

        <plot>[I]Super Air Zonk: Rockabilly Paradise[/I] is the sequel to Air Zonk where once again the player takes control of the titular character in a battle against his arch nemesis, the evil SandroVitch.[CR]The gameplay is similar to the first, a 2-D side scrolling shooter where the player advances throughout the stage, destroying enemies and collecting power-ups to make it to the end of the stage and advance to the next. The standard huge bosses are still present along with the cartoonish-style of graphics that was present in its predecessor.[CR]Zonk can also transform in nine different super-powered alter egos by collecting a meat icon. They include Sushi Zonk (who hurls sushi at opponents), Mini Air-Zonk, Mr. Heli Zonk, Elvis Zonk and even Gamera Zonk. He can also morph into other forms with powers and more weaponry by combining with friends that are scattered throughout the stage.</plot>

        <plot>Super Albatross is a golf game. There are three modes available: training, match play, and tournament. Match play is essentially a story mode that casts the player in the role of a young man whose mother has passed away and who tries to find solace in golf. In this mode, opponents must be defeated in a linear fashion and courses are dictated by the story. In training and tournament modes the player can choose between six different courses. The tournament mode is a competition between various characters who appeared as opponents in the match play mode. The golf game itself is viewed from a top-down perspective at all times, and allows the player to choose the type of club as well as adjust the angle and the strength of the shot.</plot>

        <plot>Super Daisenryaku is one of the many titles in SystemSoft's long-running war strategy series. The game mechanics are based on Daisenryaku II, but many of the included maps are unique to this release, including several based on Phantasy Star in Sega's console version. There is no campaign mode, and any of the included maps can be played. Some maps are for two players, some for four, and any map can be played with any combination of human and computer players. The computer versions also feature an editor.[CR]The game is played on a large map made up of hexagonal spaces, each of which consists of one of the included terrain types. Each player controls a number of units (bought with money), which each take up one space on the grid. The unit types are for the most part based on real-life military equipment from around the time the game was released, what is available to the player depends on the chosen faction. The choices range from single nations, such as China or the USA (the CD port by Microcabin in particular adds a lot of smaller ones, like Sweden and Libya), to alliances and blocs, for example NATO, which uses a mixture of equipment of it's members.[CR]Different units have different strengths and weaknesses, which affect their performance in combat and their general role on the battlefield. The cheap infantry units for example are not very strong and mobile, but may capture facilities and cities, unlike battle tanks. Terrain also affects the outcome of battles. The goal of each game is to capture the other players' capitals.</plot>

        <plot>Super Darius II takes place sometime after the first Darius game. The colonized planet Darius is recuperating from its invasion from the alien Belser Army thanks to that game's heroes Proco and Tiat. Darius' inhabitants have since situated themselves on the planet Olga while Darius' societies, architecture and attacked areas were being repaired. The space flight Headquarters established on Olga picks up an SOS signal coming from Earth, where the first colonists originated before colonizing Darius. The signal included the description of alien ships similar to those of the Belser Army. Suspecting that these might be their remaining Earthling ancestors, the people of Darius sends both Proco Jr. and Tiat Young to help them.[CR]The Super CD-ROM version features an entirely new set of bosses, major changes to levels, and a fully arranged soundtrack including new songs.[CR]The game is set in the inner half of the solar system, and has the same branching level structure as Darius.[CR]The red/green/blue powerups from the first game return, and have the same function: respectively, upgrades to the "missile" main weapon and "bomb" subweapon, and a shield to absorb some damage. Two new power-ups were added: a yellow powerup that adds a new "laser" main weapon that functions somewhat similarly to the bombs, and a rainbow powerup that grants one upgrade to all the players weapons.[CR]Actually acquiring these powerups and the upgrade path is completely different from Darius: a formation of a specific enemy must be completely destroyed (and a given formation may not have a powerup), and every single powerup now grants some kind of upgrade. Further, the various weapons upgrade differently, though the shield upgrade the same as before.[CR]Another new feature in Darius II is the appearance of minibosses known as "captains"; large enemies that appear somewhere in the level before the main boss. In Darius II, these are all smaller versions of bosses from the first game, with similar abilities.</plot>

        <plot>Super Mahjong Taikai is a follow-up to Mahjong Taikai. The game's structure and gameplay are nearly identical to those of its predecessor. Among the differences is the possibility to select a portrait of the main character (male or female) and a few additional historical characters to compete against: for example, the medieval Japanese warlord Oda Nobunaga is now joined by Toyotomi Hideyoshi and Tokugawa Ieyasu, famous historical characters of the same era. The roster of modern characters (in particular developers such as Kou Shibusawa) has been expanded as well. Like in the previous game, the grand tournament mode can only be accessed after the player has sufficiently advanced in the ranking.</plot>

        <plot>Super Schwarzschild is a spin-off entry in the Schwarzschild series. The game's scenario is based on that of Schwarzschild II. The story is much more elaborate and character-specific; unlike the earlier game, there is a linear plot advanced through dialogue and anime-style cutscenes. The player takes control of Alcion, the crown prince of the Auraclume kingdom, who is forced to terminate his studies abroad and return to his country in order to defend it against a treacherous enemy.[CR]The gameplay system is vastly different as well; as opposed to the main entries in the series, Super Schwarzschild is not a grand strategy game. The gameplay is confined to much smaller areas and is also significantly more linear and mission-oriented. Rather than presenting free-form gameplay and interaction with a multitude of nations, the game is restricted to a single military conflict. Diplomacy options are completely gone; finances, resource management, and research have been simplified. Much of the game is dedicated to military strategy and tactics, involving arming and deploying ships. Battles are actively controlled by the player; they take place on separate small screens and require the player to navigate ships and attack enemy craft in turn-based fashion.</plot>

        <plot>The follow-up to Super Schwarzschild offers an original scenario that takes place after the Great Somari War. Like other Schwarzschild games, it is set in the 40th century and portrays a complex political and military situation within a star system. The events of the game take place in or around the once powerful kingdom of Istramu, which was severely weakened by the king's death. Temporary leaders replaced each other, and the instability led to a global revolt in the surrounding space. The player takes the role of various characters belonging to the resistance movement.[CR]Like the previous game, Super Schwarzschild has less grand strategy elements than the main Schwarzschild installments, and focuses on smaller-scale military strategy and tactics. There are no diplomacy options; resource management and research are simplified. There are more belligerents and somewhat more freedom in strategic planning than in the preceding game. Battles take place on separate screens and follow a turn-based tactical model. Similarly to the predecessor, the game features extensive cutscenes and dialogue that advance the plot.</plot>

        <plot>One night, a lone, grim-looking traveler who calls himself Ax appears in a pub at the outskirts of Satania castle. He meets Althea, a girl from a village whose inhabitants were massacred by orcs. The two travel to the castle, where they meet the king of Satania, and learn of an ancient powerful artifact that has now caused the resurrection of a powerful demon. Ax reveals his own demonic heritage, but is willing to join forces with the people of the kingdom and fight against his kin...[CR]Completely unrelated to an earlier game of the same name, Sword Master is a tactical RPG, i.e. a hybrid of Japanese-style RPG and strategic battles. The player controls a small party at first, but later can command several units. Most of the gameplay takes place on the battle fields. The player navigates the heroes in turn-based fashion, attacking or casting magic when the enemy is in range. Attacks are presented as short full-screen animated sequences. Characters gain experience after each attack and might level up in the middle of the battle.[CR]Unlike many other games of this kind, Sword Master contains an additional RPG element in the possibility to navigate the characters in real time in towns and other "friendly" areas. The story progression, however, is completely linear, and the player can not explore hostile areas.</plot>

        <plot>In Terraforming, the human race has fled into the depths of space after Earth has become uninhabitable. As a result, they travel from planet to planet in an attempt to find a planet suitable enough to terraform into a new Earth. Along the way they encounter alien races which they must destroy in an attempt to survive and continue the human race.[CR]The gameplay is a basic side-scrolling shooter, shooting down enemy space ships, picking up power-ups and health icons and upgrading main and secondary weapons along with the obligatory huge stage bosses. The most notable feature of the game is the work done by Syd Mead, a special effects artist for such films as Star Trek: The Motion Picture, Blade Runner, Aliens, 2010 and as recent as Mission Impossible III.</plot>

        <rom name="chd_pcecd/CHD-PCECD/Sylphia (Japan).chd" size="320546543"/>
        <plot>Sylphia is a vertical shooter published by Tonkin House. The game draws from Greek mythology and tells the story of Sylphia, a female warrior with a tragic destiny. Her tale starts as she lays fatally wounded in the temple of Athena - merciless monsters have taken over the city and she perished as she desperately tried to protect innocent villagers. The gods, touched by the sincerity of the young woman's devotion and love, decide to give Sylphia another chance... Now turned into a Sylphid with tremendous powers, the female warrior embarks on a long journey of revenge, ready to fight for her homeland. Sylphia starts equipped with a fairly basic fire weapon that can be upgraded in various ways - four different types based on the four basic elements are available throughout the game, from Fire (Red), Air (Green), Water (Blue) and Earth (Brown). Each weapon type is associated with an additional sub-weapon which range from Homing Fireballs (Red), Reverse Fire (Blue), Ring Blades (Green) and Rotating Rocks (Brown). Sylphia can also trigger a devastative special attack that deals great damage to on-screen enemies - this power is obviously available in limited quantities and may only be be used in desperate situations. Various other items are available for the taking, such as extra lives, Mirrors/Gems (slowly increase a health bar located at the bottom of the screen that gives the player an extra life when full) and Green Orbs (increase the active weapon's power level). Sylphia consists of eight stages and is single player only.</plot>

        <plot>The TV Show is a humorous overhead action game similar to Bomberman in concept. The game consists of a scenario mode (single-player) and a versus mode (up to four players). Both modes offer seven characters to choose from. The characters are comically-themed and include a hyperactive schoolgirl, an armored ninja, and others. There is no real storyline behind these characters; each comes with a short introduction sequence that invariably leads to their admittance to an alien-organized TV show, where they have to defeat enemies and retrieve prizes.[CR]Each stage is an overhead screen containing the protagonist, enemies, the prize, and several bombs. The bombs should be picked up and carried around; they are used to deal with enemies and blow up the receptacle in which the prize is contained. The green bombs change their color to yellow and red when picked up, at which point they are about to explode and have to be thrown to avoid damage. Bombs also blow holes in the terrain, and the player must pay attention not to fall through. In addition to bomb-carrying and bomb-throwing, each character possesses a special ability. These range from throwing projectiles at enemies to speeding up when driving a bike, depending on the selected character.</plot>

        <plot>Tadaima Yūsha Boshūchū is a semi-humorous title that incorporates elements of role-playing and strategy board game. The game is set in a medieval fantasy land populated by various races; when the country is overrun by demonic invaders, the king cowardly avoids responsibility and puts the task of liberating it into the hands of a group of heroes. Four players (human or AI-controlled) select their characters, each representing an exotic race, and take them on a quest to free the land.[CR]Navigation is done in a board game style; each of the players rolls dice, which determines the amount of moves the character can make. Characters belong to different classes and have unique attributes, abilities, hit and magic points, etc. In towns the characters can rest, purchase magic spells of various levels and elemental disciplines, buy items, and hire companions in bars. These companions also come in many varieties (magic users, monks, barbarians, etc.), and it is necessary to create a balanced party with spellcasters, healers and physically tough characters to prevail.[CR]Fields the characters land on may lead to random events such as stats and money increase, as well as battles. The latter are handled in traditional Japanese-style, turn-based RPG fashion, viewed from a Final Fantasy-like perspective. The player inputs commands (attack, magic, item, etc.) until the enemies are defeated, at which point battle spoils are acquired. Towns are often overrun by tougher enemies and can be liberated by vanquishing them. Should two player-controlled parties meet each other on the same field, they can opt to fight each other.</plot>

In the beginning of the game, the player views the statistics of each girl and her personality description. Afterwards, the training begins. Most of the game is spent planning schedules for the girls. Practicing music skills, working, having a vacation - everything has an influence on the girls' statistics. It is important to keep the girls happy and reduce their stress; at the same time, having vacations without practicing will diminish their professional skill. Keeping the right balance is the key here.[CR]After a period of training, the player chooses which specific branch he/she wants the girls to compete in: commercial photos (model), staging a musical, performing a pop concert, making a movie, etc. Depending on the player's preparations and previous training, the girls will get higher or lower ratings. The player-controlled group competes against other agencies in a league, and results are shown after each major event.</plot>

        <plot>Tenchi Muyō! Ryō-ōki is based on the manga and anime series Tenchi Muyo, in particular the 20-episode OVA Tenchi Muyo: Ryo-ohki (same name as the game, but with a slightly different official romanization). The story centers around a seemingly ordinary boy Tenchi Masaki, who lives in the countryside on the Earth. After accidentally releasing a spaced pirate named Ryoko, his modest house attracts the attention of powerful people from space, including an officer of the Galaxy Police, a famous scientist, and two sisters from a royal family in search of their long-lost half-brother. Soon Tenchi finds out the truth about his own identity and his super-powers, but still can't quite handle a household with five attractive young women, some of which seem to have a special interest in him...[CR]The game is a traditional Japanese-style adventure: no puzzles, but many situations during which the player has to make choices. These choices lead to branching story lines, which in their turn lead to different endings. The game is viewed from first-person perspective, beside navigation around Tenchi's house, which uses a platform view.</plot>

        <plot>Originating in the arcades, Dynasty Wars is a beat-em-up set during the Three Kingdoms Era of the Chinese history, and is, more specifically, based on the Tenchi o Kurau manga adaptation of the story. The player adopts the identity of an ancient Chinese warrior, and riding on horseback has to eliminate all his opponents, mostly infantry and archers. [CR]Four historical characters from the time period can be controlled: Zhang Fei (fights with a halberd), Liu Bei (broadsword), Guan Yu (a Chinese pole weapon known as guan dao), and Zhao Yun (pike); some of the character names are misspelled in translated versions. The characters are distinguished by their health and strength parameters.[CR]The game uses a lateral scroll and the player can move in all four directions. A novelty is the attack system: when pressing fire the energy of the attack will load up as the warrior moves his weapon up and backwards, in order to gain momentum. The more the player can keep fire pressed, the more powerful the attack will be. In addition, so-called "tactics" can be used at specific moments; these are powerful area attacks that deplete the protagonist's HP in process and range from summoning an ambush partner and causing rocks slide down slopes.[CR]Stages typically culminate in boss battles. Along the way, various power-ups can be collected. Besides treasure that increases the player's score, and food packs that heal the protagonist, there are also yellow and blue orbs, which represent the game's light RPG elements: yellow orbs count as experience points and increase the character's vitality after a stage is over, and blue orbs increase the power of his weapon.</plot>

        <plot>Bomberman '94 Special Version was a limited edition game with approximately 10,000 copies produced and only given away through Hudson's newsletter and at one of their caravan tournament site, apparently (source). The release date is unknown, but one can assume it came out before the retail release.[CR]Deden no Den was released the following year, and is near-enough the exact same game. All the Bombermen have been replaced with Kabuki Denjirou, a character from the Tengai Makyou / Far East of Eden RPG series (most of which were co-developed and published by Hudson Soft).[CR]Note: you can't change the other players to CPU, it's exclusively human opponents only.</plot>

        <plot>Long time ago, humans lived in a paradise, the Garden of Eden. But the brave and audacious members of the Fire Clan were banned from Eden, and had to seek shelter on the Earth. They built their own paradise - the land they later called Jipang. However, the evil demon lord Masakado wanted to destroy Jipang, and the Fire Clan fought and defeated him. Now, many years later, a young thief named Ziria learns that he is a descendant of the Fire Clan. He must now find the other members, and prevent the resurrection of Masakado by his followers.[CR]Loosely based on the Japanese folk tale of the ninja Jiraiya, [I]Tengai Makyō: Ziria[/I] was the first role-playing game released on a CD ROM; thanks to the medium's greater storage capacity, the game was able to include full-screen anime-style cutscenes with voice-overs. It is the first entry in the [I]Tengai Makyō[/I] series, and is generally considered the first RPG with significant humorous content. The game's setting parodies many aspects of feudal Japan, containing comical and sometimes deliberately stereotypical portrayals of characters and plenty of supernatural elements.[CR]Basic gameplay mechanics follow a template introduced in early Dragon Quest and Phantasy Star games. The player navigates Ziria and other characters who eventually join him on a top-down overworld, visiting towns to rest and buy supplies, and facing randomly appearing enemies in round-based combat viewed from first-person perspective. Each character uses his or her own unique weapon and equipment types. Magic spells cannot be bought or learned automatically when leveling up; they must be sought out in specific locations, often those not required to visit in order to advance the story. [CR]The game's overworld is fairly vast, divided into provinces, each containing several towns and other locations. It is possible to teleport instantly from the world map to any previously visited province.The game emphasizes overworld exploration; dungeons tend to be smaller and less maze-like than in many other contemporary role-playing games. In towns, the player can gamble and deposit money in banks; this money is preserved if the party is annihilated in combat and transported back to the town, with the money it was carrying cut in half. When a character levels up, his or her hit points (HP) and magic points (MP) are fully restored.</plot>

        <plot>Kearu, a young warrior from the land of Erin, is entrusted by his village elder to protect Krea, a young girl who was found near the village entrance when she was a baby. The young couple receives a task of retrieving and delivering a magic flower known as Eureka to the king. However, on the way to the castle, they are attacked by a winged monster, who carries Krea away. Kearu realizes that this kidnapping was not accidental, and had something to do with Krea's mysterious origin.[CR]Tenshi no Uta is a traditional Japanese-style role-playing game. As in most games of this genre, the player navigates the party of heroes on the top-down world map, fighting randomly appearing enemies, gaining experience for further automatic leveling-up, and money to buy better weapons, armor, and items. The battles are viewed from first-person perspective, with the enemy graphics super-imposed on the exploration screen (like in Cosmic Fantasy 2). The game has the conventional HP and MP bars, with the heroes learning various attack, support, and healing spells as dictated by their level.[CR]There is a day and night cycle in the game. Shops are closed at night, and certain characters appear only at a specific day time.</plot>

        <plot>Fate is a young man whose job is to patrol the land around his village and protect it from monsters. One day, during such a patrol, Fate and his friend Shion encounter a mysterious girl in the nearby tower. She could only remember that her name was Rhianna, but nothing else about her origins and how she ended up being in that tower. Shortly afterwards, the village is attacked by monsters and burnt down. Fate, Shion, and Rhianna escape, and Fate promises Rhianna that he will help her regain her memory and find the truth about her past.[CR]Tenshi no Uta II: Datenshi no Sentaku is not directly related to its predecessor story-wise (though it is set in the same universe, and some characters from the previous game make an appearance here). Graphically and gameplay-wise, it is nearly identical to it, with the exception of a few minor tweaks (such as characters regaining full health after level up): an archetypal Japanese-style RPG with random enemies, turn-based combat, linear story progression, and automatic character growth. Like the first game, Datenshi no Sentaku has a day and night cycle.</plot>

        <plot>In Terraforming, the human race has fled into the depths of space after Earth has become uninhabitable. As a result, they travel from planet to planet in an attempt to find a planet suitable enough to terraform into a new Earth. Along the way they encounter alien races which they must destroy in an attempt to survive and continue the human race.[CR]The gameplay is a basic side-scrolling shooter, shooting down enemy space ships, picking up power-ups and health icons and upgrading main and secondary weapons along with the obligatory huge stage bosses. The most notable feature of the game is the work done by Syd Mead, a special effects artist for such films as Star Trek: The Motion Picture, Blade Runner, Aliens, 2010 and as recent as Mission Impossible III.</plot>

        <plot>While flying your spaceship, you crash land on a planet covered entirely in slime. You and a friend explore the labyrinthine planet of slime, armed with a water pistol and all manner of gadgets you find along the way in an effort to find your way back out. The game world is a giant maze with quirky hidden areas and plenty of original layout ideas. Depending on the game mode, you are either cooperating or competing with your "friend" to find and get to an exit first. Due to the massive sizes of the slime worlds (about 6 entries to choose from), games often take several hours to complete.[CR]The basis of the game is exploration, with varying game modes further focusing on competition, puzzle solving, speed, exploration, or cooperation.</plot>

        <plot>Top o Nerae! GunBuster Vol.1 is based on the anime OVA series Gunbuster by Gainax. In the early 21th century humanity discovered a race of bug-like aliens while colonizing known space. The aliens steadily advance towards the Earth with the goal of eradicating it. To counter that, humans have developed giant mechas that ca be navigated by trained pilots. The story of the game follows closely the first chapter of the anime, focusing on the young pilot Noriko Takaya and her first steps towards the mastery of her dangerous profession.[CR]The game has a Japanese-style adventure-like interface (with Look, Talk, and other verb commands leading to sub-menus), but plays more like a cross between an interactive movie (with animated scenes and voice-overs) and a visual novel, where choices of actions and responses play a dominant role. Every wrong action raises the heroine's "stress meter"; once it is full, the game is over.</plot>

        <plot>Top o Nerae! GunBuster Vol.2 is a direct sequel to the first episode based on the Gunbuster anime series. It continues the story started in the first chapter, following the adventures of the young mecha pilot Noriko Takaya as she passes the test and is admitted into the fighting squad of mechas, sent on a mission to stop an insectoid race of aliens from destroying the Earth.[CR]Gameplay-wise, the second episode differs from the previous one in that it eschews even the rudimentary Japanese-style adventure commands. It plays more like a pure interactive movie: the player watches animated, voiced scenes and from time to time has to make a decision for Noriko, influencing subsequent scenes. The "stress meter" from the preceding game has been removed as well. The game also contains extras such as character and robot introduction, a radio drama, and a "rock-paper-scissors" game against Noriko.</plot>

        <plot>Travel Apple is a cute puzzle/action game by Telenet and is somehow inspired by other Battle Games including Hudson Soft's famous Bomberman. Epuru, the heroine of the game, is a cute little girl in a big and cartoony penguin suit. Penguins, as you soon discover, are everywhere in this game and the action starts in the white landscapes of Antartica. She is accompanied by her pet-penguin and his cute little hat. The goal of the game is to clean up every stage during intense one-on-one fights. Various weapons can be collected and used against your opponent : clubs, metal pipes but also hand grenades and bombs. Other items, like potions, will help our heroine and give her some life back. Battle fields are also filled with special blocks and tiles, like traps, teleporters or green reviving pools. The game will take our friend to different parts of the world and affront many enemies, including crazy wales, giant shrimps, insane scientists, military freaks and finally, the evil master penguin. Travel Epuru also includes a fun two-player versus mode.</plot>

        <plot>The most famous story of the heroic past is called "Knights of Legend". It is a story about heroes who have descended into hell, defeated the Demon King, and saved the seven worlds from grave peril. This story is now taught in all the schools for young adventurers, who wish to become heroes and defeat the minions of hell once and for all. Those who have already graduated are called "travelers"; four of them are the heroes of the game - two young men and two young women. Led by the reckless swordsman Ufuru, the travelers begin to roam the land in search of adventure...[CR]The game is a rather traditional Japanese RPG. The player always controls the party of four heroes; the two men use sword techniques, one of the girls specializes in offensive magic, while the other one is a healer. The player navigates the party over the "world map", visiting towns and descending into dungeons. Randomly appearing enemies are fought in turn-based style. Leveling up is automatic, like in most games of the kind. There is a day/night cycle in the game.</plot>

        <rom name="chd_pcecd/CHD-PCECD/Uchuu Senkan Yamato (Japan).chd" size="201999424"/>
        <plot>Uchū Senkan Yamato is based on the anime series Space Battleship Yamato, also known as Star Blazers. The events of the game follow those of the initial episodes. In the end of the 22nd century, Gamila aliens bombard Earth with radioactive meteorites. As a result, the planet's surface becomes uninhabitable, and humans begin to dwell underground. Using the ruins of the World War II Japanese battleship Yamato, humans construct a powerful spaceship and can finally engage the aliens in direct confrontation.[CR]This incarnation of the series is essentially a real-time strategy game with a somewhat unusual approach to the genre. Rather than navigating units on battlefields, the player takes direct control of every crew member onboard the ship. Each one of them is responsible for a certain function (supplying power, manning a gun, turning the ship, etc.); in order to win battles, it is crucial to coordinate their actions. The game proceeds in real time, but pauses when the player accesses crew members and performs actions for them.</plot>

        <plot>The second installment in the Ultrabox game magazine-on-CD series contains the following mini-games: [CR]A continuation of Kamen Victor's adventures from the previous issue, this time not as a side-scroller, but as a top-down motorcycle driving game. The player collects hearts for speed boosts and has to avoid yakuza gangsters while trying to complete stages within limited time. [CR]The opening chapter of Cusuto, a story that deals with mysterious crystals left on the Earth by aliens, and focuses on the discovery of one of them by the archaeologist Royce E. Grant and his daughter. The game consists mostly of animated voiced cutscenes, with a very brief first-person dungeon exploration during which the player decides in which direction to go. [CR]A puzzle game that involves knocking down "daruma" dolls (so named as they originally depicted the famous Buddhist monk Bodhidharma), trying to trick the AI-controlled opponent into being left with only one doll in each column.[CR]A dating simulation game in which the player character meets three young women in a bar and has to choose the correct dialogue options in order to pursue a relationship. [CR]In addition, this volume contains the semi-interactive Mission School, which allows viewing Japanese uniformed schoolgirls with different backgrounds, previews of upcoming PC Engine games and a detailed database of existing ones, further astrological exploits with wrestlers (this time depicted with graphics rather than digitized photos), as well as a miscellaneous section with fan drawings.</plot>

The protagonist in this chapter is a young man named Gilbert, who meets Royce and his daughter on his journey. The number of full-screen cutscenes has been greatly reduced, and the gameplay expanded to resemble a Japanese-style adventure with menu-based verb-object commands.[CR]The wrestler Rusher Kimura returns with his zodiac horoscope, which this time contains within a monopoly-like board game for up to four players. Players select wrestlers with different statistics and navigate them on a board with dice rolls. Various encounters alter their attributes and wealth, and some lead to battles, which involve selecting cards with attack and defense ratings written on them; having a higher rating results in inflicting damage on the opponent.[CR]In the dating game UB Club the player meets a young woman on a party, and has to select the right conversation choices in order to raise her "love meter" and successfully conclude the romance.[CR]Making of Dorayaki Quest is a simple game with humorous overtones, in which the player has to make the correct decisions in order to successfully produce a video game.[CR]Reverse 3 is a puzzle game. Red and blue squares appear on a board, and the player has to flip them in order to make adjacent squares change the color. The goal is to change all of the squares to the same color. Three stages of different sizes are included.[CR]Princess of PC Engine contains information about female characters from PC Engine games, e.g. the heroines of Valis series, Saya from Cosmic Fantasy, Tsunade from Tengai Makyō: Ziria, and others. This section also includes a sliding puzzle, a slot machine game (leading to another database in case of success), and a quiz that measures the player's affinities with the characters.[CR]Like in the previous installment, a detailed PC Engine game catalogue (with previews) and a section containing fan photography and drawings is includes.</plot>

        <plot>The fourth installment of the CD ROM game magazine series contains the following mini-games:[CR]The retro sci-fi tale with minimalistic Japanese-style adventure gameplay, Cusuto, continues, as Royce E. Grant, his daughter, and Gilbert are searching for the mystical alien heritage, trying to evade the hostile military forces.[CR]Fone is a simple top-down role-playing game in Japanese style. The player controls a party of three characters, who are sent by the king to vanquish a newly reborn evil with the titular magic power. Automatic leveling up, equipment, random enemies, and first-person-view turn-based combat are all present.[CR]The dating game is this time set in the Edo period of the Japanese history, and has somewhat more extensive gameplay with location and conversation choices. The goal is the same as before: raise the "love meter" of a woman in order to fulfill a romance. [CR]Nobunaga no Yarō (which can be translated as "The Jerk Nobunaga"; an obvious pun on Nobunaga no Yabō) is a puzzle game very similar to UB64 from the first volume. The player has to move soldiers on a field in a checkers-like pattern (jumping over other soldiers diagonally) to make an army advance.[CR]A jumping rope game in which the player has to press a button at the correct time so that the girl won't trip on the rope. A bird is flying above the girl's head, dropping what appears to be excrements on her; if she is hit by those, the amount of rope-skipping needed to complete the stage increases. To avoid this predicament, the player can also press directional buttons to move the girl around. When on the ground, the unsavory objects turn into power-ups. The girl removes an item of her clothes after each successfully completed level, until she begins to jump naked.[CR]A simple stationary first-person shooter game, in which the player has to shoot a young woman who is trying to capture various wild animals. Shooting the animals, on the other hand, gradually leads to a Game Over. The woman undresses after each level.[CR]Like in the previous volumes, a detailed database of PC Engine games is included along with previous of upcoming releases. Miscellaneous section now also includes short digital comics along with pictures and other information.</plot>

Grant and his friends as they encounter a mysterious alien crystal.[CR]The dating game is very similar to the one from the third installment; it is set in modern times and has the player selecting correct choices in order to raise the "love level" of three Japanese young women encountered on a beach and represented by digitized photos of actresses.[CR]The nearly-hentai sports game from the previous entry returns, featuring the same girl, but with a different activity: hurdling. The girl runs automatically; the player presses a button to make the girl jump over a hurdle, or directional arrows to slow down or speed up. Colored balloons float above the track; touching red ones increase the number of hurdles needed to complete a stage, while the opposite happens if a blue balloon is touched. The girl undresses after each stage, and runs topless in the last one.[CR]Dasaiyas is a horizontally scrolling shoot-em-up in which the player character flies on a board through Asian-looking urban stages, shooting at enemies with the basic weapon or dropping limited amounts of bombs. Each stage ends with a boss battle against fish-like spaceships.[CR]Tororo is a choose-your-own-adventure game where the protagonist wished to become an anime artist. The player can either go to a school or directly to a company's boss, depending on the player's choice. Further plot development is also influenced by the player's decisions.[CR]Two digital comics, one dealing with the life of an angel-like creature in heavenly spheres, and the other involving buying video games and playing them at home, evolve in accordance with the player's occasional input.[CR]Like in all the previous installments, a PC Engine game database and an art section with fan drawings are available.</plot>

The protagonist is Ataru Moroboshi, a high school student who accidentally evokes love in the heart of Lum, the princess of an alien demon-like race.

Ataru's ex-girlfriend Shinobu disappears under mysterious circumstances. Ataru and Lum must explore the high school building and find out what happened to Shinobu.[CR]The gameplay is that of a traditional Japanese-style adventure, where all interaction (including navigation) is performed by selecting verb commands from a menu and combining them with objects from a list. game progression is fairly linear, and it is typically required to complete an objective in one location in order to be able to proceed to the next one. There are no real puzzles, but an inventory with items that can be examined is present.</plot>

The game shows Yuuko's new adventure along her new companions: Valna and Cham.[CR]Story[CR]Long time passed since Yuuko's last battle. Yuuko's life seems peaceful but, meanwhile, the Dark world starts to get menaced to become disappeared in the void. So Its king, Glames, decides to take other worlds by force in order to keep the inhabitants from his world alive. But some of the dark world people oppose to the idea of using the force to take the worlds, so Glames starts to dispose them. As a consequence, a girl from the resistance of such world, Cham, decides to go to the human world and search for the Valis sword to use It against Glames who, in turn, posseses the counterpart of the Valis sword, the Leethus sword. After taking the sword, Cham tries to go back to the dark world but Yuuko stops her to find out why she wants her sword only to see the girl kidnapped by one of Glames's generals. After Yuuko beats him, Cham is freed an tells the Valis warrior about the situation and that Vanity is being invaded by Glames's army. Without wasting time, Yuuko and Cham make their ways to the dream world to see It in chaos due to the dark king's intromission as they find out that Valna has been also kidnapped by other of the generals. The heroines make their way to Valna and freed her. She then fights and beats her captor, then she says Yuuko to go to the temple where the widsom man, Nizetti, can give her the Valis armor's ultimate form unleashing all of Valis sword's power. Meanwhile, a strange figure allies with Glames. The three girls go there passing terrible tests and obstacles finally meeting with Nizetti who warns them that although having the sword's full power, Yuuko maybe won't win against Glames, but aside of all negative pronostics, she still decides to use the power. After doing so, they make their way to the dark world to confront Glames, not before getting onto the death world to find an awful surprise, the figure that allied with Glames reveals itself as Rogles, the antagonist from the first game who was supposed to be dead. He fights Yuuko and gets deffeated once again by her. The way continues as the protagonist fight Zalude and Asura. After his defeat, Asura reports them that Glames isn't on the dark world anymore and that he made his way into the human world showing that his generals were only making time for him to approach there.

Yuuko's life seems peaceful but, meanwhile, the Dark world starts to get menaced to become disappeared in the void. So Its king, Glames, decides to take other worlds by force in order to keep the inhabitants from his world alive. But some of the dark world people oppose to the idea of using the force to take the worlds, so Glames starts to dispose them. As a consequence, a girl from the resistance of such world, Cham, decides to go to the human world and search for the Valis sword to use It against Glames who, in turn, posseses the counterpart of the Valis sword, the Leethus sword. After taking the sword, Cham tries to go back to the dark world but Yuuko stops her to find out why she wants her sword only to see the girl kidnapped by one of Glames's generals. After Yuuko beats him, Cham is freed an tells the Valis warrior about the situation and that Vanity is being invaded by Glames's army. Without wasting time, Yuuko and Cham make their ways to the dream world to see It in chaos due to the dark king's intromission as they find out that Valna has been also kidnapped by other of the generals. The heroines make their way to Valna and freed her. She then fights and beats her captor, then she says Yuuko to go to the temple where the widsom man, Nizetti, can give her the Valis armor's ultimate form unleashing all of Valis sword's power. Meanwhile, a strange figure allies with Glames. The three girls go there passing terrible tests and obstacles finally meeting with Nizetti who warns them that although having the sword's full power, Yuuko maybe won't win against Glames, but aside of all negative pronostics, she still decides to use the power. After doing so, they make their way to the dark world to confront Glames, not before getting onto the death world to find an awful surprise, the figure that allied with Glames reveals itself as Rogles, the antagonist from the first game who was supposed to be dead. He fights Yuuko and gets deffeated once again by her. The way continues as the protagonist fight Zalude and Asura. After his defeat, Asura reports them that Glames isn't on the dark world anymore and that he made his way into the human world showing that his generals were only making time for him to approach there.

In the end, Glames expresses his last will to his opponents to maintain alive the dark world's inhabitants and to guard the Leethus sword, he dies minutes later. Yuuko then says to Cham and Valna to protect the survivors and goes to the sky with the two swords. She stays there guarding the two swords...apparently forever.</plot>

        <plot>Mugen Senshi Valis IV (夢幻戦士ヴァリスIV, Mugen senshi Varisu fou) – also known as Mugen Senshi Valis 4: Akai Tsuki no Otome, Super Valis IV or Valis 4 – is the last of the main Valis series games. This game's events happen 15 years after those of Valis III and introduce a new protagonist: Lena Brande.[CR]Story[CR]Hundreds of years ago, the king Asfal from the Dark World had a son, Galgear, who was driven insane by the power of a ring that he inherited from his father, causing wars and widespread destruction in order to make that power grow constantly.[CR]Consequently, the gods imprisoned Galgear and his followers in a giant crystal and sank it under the seas.[CR]Many centuries have passed and the crystal emerges to the surface once again with Galgear and his army broken free, bringing an end to the short-lived era of peace enjoyed by Vecanti after Glames' defeat in Valis III.[CR]With his reign of chaos reestablished, Glames takes over Vecanti and starts to take over the human world also. Galgear then kidnaps Vecanti's current queen, Valna, and prepares her execution.[CR]Meanwhile, a resistance force in the dream world led by Cham tries to fight Galgear's regime but this seems to be useless. Lena, a member of the resistance, decides to rescue Valna along with her sister Amu. Although Cham isn't in accordance with her, she hears Yuuko's voice telling her to let Lena go. Having no other option, Cham teaches them some basic things and then stays behind in Vecanti guarding the city and the survivors.[CR]Lena and Amu manage to infiltrate Castle Vanity and defeat the first of Galgear's generals, Dhalgen. Then they find Valna and try to rescue her just to be stopped and injured by Galgear himself, meeting him personally for the first time. Just as he is going to deal the heroines the final blow, they are teleported away by a stranger who reveals himself to be Asfal, Galgear's father himself, who also wants to stop his son's evil regime. He tells Lena that the only thing that can defeat his son is the Valis sword, which isn't in this world anymore, and that they have to reach Valhalla in the sky in order to obtain It from Yuuko, the most recent Valis warrior and current guardian of the sword.[CR]After overcoming many obstacles, they meet Yuuko who warns Lena about the things she will have to live as a Valis warrior by showing her memories and asks if she still wants to become a Valis warrior. Lena answers decidedly that she will accept that destiny if she can save the three worlds from Galgear. Yuuko then tests her with satisfactory results and gives her the Valis sword and thus the Valis armor.[CR]Afterward, the three protagonists make their way into the human world to reach the giant crystal Galgear uses as his base. After beating many of his henchmen and his last two generals, they find Galgear trying to kill Valna once again. It seems to be too late to save her, but Amu steps in front of Galgear's axe throw, saving Valna's life but being mortally injured.[CR]Asfal releases Valna and holds off his son while Amu dies in her sister's arms. Lena then addresses Galgear, saying that she will put an end to him once and for all. Galgear challenges her to come and fight him in his lair, the red moon, where Asfal lived when he was king.[CR]Lena and Asfal open a path to the red moon where they fight Galgear, defeating him sucessfully. Asfal and Galgear apologize to each other respectively for all that has happened, after which Galgear dies in the arms of his father. Lena then goes to Amu's grave to pay her last respects and starts to walk toward the horizon, asking herself what will await in the future.</plot>

        <plot>Vasteel 2 is formally a sequel to Vasteel; it is also set in the eponymous fictional, futuristic solar system and deals primarily with strategic battles between robots. However, its story is not directly connected with that of the predecessor. The main hero is a young boy named Voice Knuckles, who enjoys a peaceful life with his mother and his girlfriend Diggy. But the cruel Emperor Agares attacks his planet and destroys Voice's home, killing his mother in the process. The boy swears revenge. Aided by his girlfriend and his friends, he assembles a rebel army from fighters who navigate giant robots, and is determined to defeat Agares at all costs.[CR]The game is more story-heavy than its predecessor, and has more clearly pronounced anime/manga aesthetics. Animated cut scenes occur between the missions and advance the story. Even during the large strategic battles, characters would often engage in dialogue, and scripted events might occur.[CR]The gameplay also underwent some changes. Vasteel 2 is, like its predecessor, a hex-based, turn-based strategy game with robotic combat; however, the action sequences are gone, and the battles now proceed automatically, as in most games of this genre. Robot production and financial management were also simplified or removed. However, the player can choose to use various types of weapons before engaging an enemy in combat. For example, robots can use melee attacks, bipedal tanks can use different laser beams, etc.</plot>

        <plot>A "Pretty Girl Contest" is held, which is more than just a regular beauty competition: within a year, a young girl should become a star. Beauty matters, but so does skill. As the manager of one of the young girls who wants to participate in the contest, the player has to do everything in his/her power to attain the goal, and help the disciple reach stardom![CR]Virgin Dream is what is commonly called life simulation, a genre popularized by games such as the Princess Maker series. The player manages the life of the young girl with a specific goal in mind, which must be chosen from the main menu. The girl can strive to become a singer, a photo model, a school teacher, etc. The player then tries to alter her statistics accordingly to achieve the goal.[CR]The main activities on work days are divided into three groups: training, working, and learning. The learning category is the smallest one, but is also necessary for continuing the girl's normal school life. Training includes singing, arts, body building, sports, etc. Part-time jobs such as waitress, cook, private tutor, and even construction worker are available; the pay varies greatly, but so are the changes in parameters.[CR]On holidays, the girl is able to venture outside and explore the top-down city, which contains various shops, boutiques, offices, etc. Clothes and other accessories can be purchased. It is also possible to talk and bond with other girls, potential rivals, who live in the same dormitory. All this influences the heroine's parameters, for good and for bad.</plot>

        <plot>Wizardry III・IV contains two role-playing games from the Wizardry series: Legacy of Llylgamyn and The Return of Werdna. Both games were ported to the PC Engine (TurboGrafx) CD console with various enhancements, unreleased separately. The player automatically starts playing Legacy of Llylgamyn; playing The Return of Werdna can be accessed via "Utility" option in the town menu. Though the game(s) are rather faithful in gameplay and graphical design to the original computer versions, the enhancements are significant enough to consider this a remake.[CR]Unlike the computer originals with their vector lines, the dungeons have simple graphics now. Enemy sprites are also drawn in a more detailed fashion. A pre-made party of six is available to the player right at the beginning, consisting of characters with generic names ("Fighter", "Samurai", etc.); creating own characters (unlike in the modified PC Engine CD version of Might and Magic), however, remains possible. Naturally, in The Return of Werdna the player controls Werdna himself and his summoned monsters. Another notable change is the inclusion of orchestrated CD audio music for dungeon navigation and (optionally) for battle music.</plot>

        <plot>After L'Kbreth's Orb was used to bring peace back to the land of Llylgamyn, a new threat emerges in the region. Strange malevolent energies have been spotted beneath the Temple of Sages. These energies - called the "Maelstrom" by the local inhabitants - can be sealed by a person known as the Gatekeeper. Unfortunately, the latter has been imprisoned by a mysterious power or person only referred to as SORN. A party of brave adventurers seeks out the high priest G'bli Gedook, the guardian of L'Kbreth's Orb, who explains to them that they have to release the Gatekeeper and eventually vanquish the evil at its core.[CR]Wizardry V: Heart of the Maelstrom returns to the gameplay concept of the first three installments of the series, abandoning the unusual premise of its predecessor. As in the initial games, the gameplay consists of exploring a vast maze-like dungeon with a custom party created and outfitted in the game's only town. Though visually very similar to their predecessors, the game's dungeon is no longer limited to a square layout. Several tweaks have been applied to the gameplay system, including range rating for all weapons (allowing back row attacks), a more prominent role for the Thief class (who can now hide in shadows, backstab enemies, and open locks), etc.[CR]The game is more puzzle-oriented than the preceding entries, requiring the player to obtain a larger quantity of crucial items needed for its completion. It is the first installment in the series with friendly NPCs who can be encountered in the dungeon and interacted with by typing keywords. Also for the first time, the game allows - but does not require - importing characters from a previous scenario.</plot>

Yawara herself is very much in the background here and not nearly as prominent as in the first game. There are a selection of bonus extras for added value.

        <plot>Based on the manga Yawara! A Fashionable Judo Girl, the game follows the story of Yawara Inokuma, the teenage granddaughter of a famous judo master. While she is trying to have an ordinary life, her grandfather insists on her studying the martial art of judo, and she has troubles to decide what her goal in life is going to be. The game's protagonist is one of the minor characters in the manga, a young journalist named Matsuda. Seeing how Yawara effortlessly beats up an assailant on the street, Matsuda decides to find out who the "wonder girl" is, feeling that she is going to become a famous sports star.[CR]The game is what is commonly known as digital comic, i.e. Japanese-style adventure game without puzzles and with very limited, basic interaction possibilities. Typically, the player is presented with a few verb commands and object sub-menus at every screen, and has to go through them in order to make progress. Animated and voiced cutscenes frequently occur in order to advance the narrative.</plot>

        <plot>Kinsenka Kyō Ezara Satsujin Jiken is based on a series on a series of novels by the Japanese detective fiction author Misa Yamamura. The popular protagonist of the novels, inspector Sōsuke Kariya, appears in the game as one of the characters; but the main heroine and the player character is Yuko Kobayakawa, a journalist working for a gourmet magazine. During a trip to Kyoto she attends a party and witnesses a mysterious murder of a wealthy man's estranged wife. Yoko decides to stay and help the authorities investigate the crime.[CR]The game plays like a puzzle-less Japanese-style adventure. Most of the time the player chooses a location to travel to and interrogates characters, selecting various topics from a list. Such scenes are presented in first-person view. A few segments, however, feature third-person navigation with point-and-click interaction, similar to Western adventures. Other instances require the player to move a cursor on a zoomed object to interact with it in a detailed way.</plot>

        <plot>Harukanaru Kioku is a re-imagining of earlier Yami no Ketsuzoku games. The basic plot follows the events that began in the first installment, but it is told in an entirely different fashion, with different scenes, dialogues, etc. For example, the game begins a short while before the starting point of the first chapter, and contains conversations between the protagonist Miyu Izawa and the murder victim Marie, which were not present in the original story. The visual style of the game is also quite different, with bright anime-like graphics atypical of the previous entries.[CR]Gameplay-wise, this installment also differs from the preceding computer games by greatly reducing interaction. All of the dialogue in the game is spoken, and much of the narration is revealed through Miyu's thoughts which act like cutscenes, rather than being derived from interaction with the environment. In essence, the game is a fairly linear visual novel with some occasions where the player is able to visit different locations.</plot>

        <plot>Tenka wa Ware ni is based on the Sangokushi manga by Mitsuteru Yokoyama, itself an adaptation of Eiji Yoshikawa's re-telling of the classic Chinese novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms by Luo Guanzhong. As such, the game includes plot elements and a few characters added by Yoshikawa or Yokoyama, but for the most part remains faithful to the general storyline of the Chinese novel and hence to the actual historical events of the Three Kingdoms Era.[CR]The gameplay is similar to that of Koei's Romance of the Three Kingdoms series, focusing on grand strategy and country management as well as on tactical battles. There is no scenario selection, but the player can choose between multiple warlords of the three kingdoms. The player then manages the province under control of the selected warlord. It is necessary to take care of the population and army, buying provisions, training officers, and publishing edicts. Diplomacy plays an important role: pacts and agreements can be made, and it is also possible to acquire new allies through various means.[CR]Invading (or being attacked by) another country leads to a large-scale tactical battle that takes place on hexagonal grids. The player navigates army divisions in turn-based fashion. Contact with an enemy division leads to yet another sub-mode, where the player controls units that form the division, positioning and navigating them on a smaller battle screen. The game also has a separate battle mode accessible from the main menu, where the player can recreate historical battles directly without going through grand strategy portions.</plot>

        <plot>The Dawn of Ys is one of two games released under the title of Ys IV, the other being Tonkin House's Ys IV: Mask of the Sun. The two games share the same basic story, but have many differences regarding concrete events, locations, gameplay details, etc. The events of the game take place a short while after those described in Ys II, and before the events of Ys III: Wanderers from Ys.[CR]As the game begins, Adol and his friend return to the town of Minea, where the first game began. The evil Lord Darm has been defeated, and it's time to relax and spend some time with friends - but not for long. A new evil is rising, and Adol decides to set sail for the overseas land of Celceta to investigate these occurrences.[CR]Ys IV returns to the style of play used in the first and second games. The gameplay area is viewed from a top-down perspective, and the player attacks enemies by running into them to cause damage. Combat is slightly more sophisticated than in the first two games, since Adol can now move in eight directions, and attacking enemies diagonally or from the sides is more efficient than bumping into them headstrong. Adol gains experience from defeating enemies, which serves to raise his attack and defense power, like in the previous games. He can equip various swords, armor, shields, and rings to enhance his attributes. The magic system introduced in Ys II is also brought back for this game.[CR]Ys IV has received a full fan translation and fan dub of all the in-game dialogue.</plot>

        <plot>The Dawn of Ys is one of two games released under the title of Ys IV, the other being Tonkin House's Ys IV: Mask of the Sun. The two games share the same basic story, but have many differences regarding concrete events, locations, gameplay details, etc. The events of the game take place a short while after those described in Ys II, and before the events of Ys III: Wanderers from Ys.[CR]As the game begins, Adol and his friend return to the town of Minea, where the first game began. The evil Lord Darm has been defeated, and it's time to relax and spend some time with friends - but not for long. A new evil is rising, and Adol decides to set sail for the overseas land of Celceta to investigate these occurrences.[CR]Ys IV returns to the style of play used in the first and second games. The gameplay area is viewed from a top-down perspective, and the player attacks enemies by running into them to cause damage. Combat is slightly more sophisticated than in the first two games, since Adol can now move in eight directions, and attacking enemies diagonally or from the sides is more efficient than bumping into them headstrong. Adol gains experience from defeating enemies, which serves to raise his attack and defense power, like in the previous games. He can equip various swords, armor, shields, and rings to enhance his attributes. The magic system introduced in Ys II is also brought back for this game.[CR]Ys IV has received a full fan translation and fan dub of all the in-game dialogue.</plot>

        <plot>Kagerō no Toki follows Yasha Enbukyoku as the next game in the Zan series.[CR]Unlike the previous game, Kagerō no Toki contains no supernatural forces (demons), and instead focuses on concrete events of the Sengoku period in Japan, more exactly 16th century, a period of Japanese history that was marked by continuous wars and famous leaders such as Oda Nobunaga or Tokugawa Ieyasu.[CR]The game offers more strategic possibilities than the previous installments of the series. Choosing a region of Japan and its leader, the player can perform a variety of activities, both in his country and towards other leaders. Diplomacy includes negotiation, signing contracts and peace treaties, etc.[CR]Battles are also more in-depth than before; instead of semi-automatic encounters battles occur on a separate map, on which the player has to actively navigate his unit, before he engages the enemy in close combat.</plot>

        <plot>Zero4 Champ II is a sequel to Zero4 Champ. This time, a young Japanese street racer has been defeated by an American who claims that Japan's level is not up to par. His feelings hurt, the youth ventures to the United States, trying to earn enough money and participate in races to defend his national pride.[CR]The game is very similar to its predecessor in concept, but offers additional options in the story mode. Part-time jobs now include delivery assignments that play like overhead racing games, as well as tending to dogs of various breeds for money. The security guard assignment plays like a mini-RPG, complete with turn-based combat, experience points, and levels. In addition, it is possible to visit racing tracks and bet money on participants. The versus mode allows players to choose between three courses to compete in, racing against each other (in a top-down mode) or computer AI (first-person).</plot>

        <plot>Zero Wing is an horizontal shooter game where the player is in control of a ZIG, an escape pod released after its main ship was attacked and destroyed by the evil cyborg CATS, bent on taking over the world.[CR]Like most games in the genre, there are three color-coded weapons: red (scatter), green (homing) and blue (lasers). Each weapon has three levels of power, and to obtain those, similar upgrades must be collected sequentially. However, what makes the game unique is the ability to use a traction beam to trap an enemy and then throw him against his peers, destroying them.[CR]The game (more precisely, the European PAL version of it) is known for being the origin of the grammatically incorrect phrase in the English translation, All your base are belong to us, which has since become an internet phenomenon.</plot>
