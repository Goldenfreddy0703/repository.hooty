        <emu_comment>The PlayStation Portable (PSP) is a handheld game console developed and marketed by Sony Computer Entertainment. It was first released in Japan on December 12, 2004, in North America on March 24, 2005, and in PAL regions on September 1, 2005, and is the first handheld installment in the PlayStation line of consoles. As a seventh generation console, the PSP primarily competed with the Nintendo DS.[CR]The system was the most powerful portable console when it was introduced, and was the first real competitor of Nintendos handheld consoles after many challengers, such as SNKs Neo Geo Pocket and Nokias N-Gage, had failed. The PSPs advanced graphics capabilities made it a popular mobile entertainment device, which could connect to the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 3 consoles, computers running Microsoft Windows and Apple Macintosh software, other PSP systems, and the Internet. The PSP is the only handheld console to use an optical disc format – Universal Media Disc (UMD) – as its primary storage medium.[CR]Developer: Sony[CR]Media Medium: UMD Disc[CR]CPU: MIPS R4000-based[CR]Memory: 32MB[CR]Graphics: Sony CXD187[CR]Sound: Embedded Virtual Mobile Engine (VME) Sound Core[CR]Display: 480 x 272</emu_comment>

		<plot>The first game in the .hack series for PSP (and the planned final game for the franchise), .hack//LINK logs player into a new version of its virtual landscape called The World R:X (the "R" stands for "Revision"). Set 10 years after the last .Hack, players take control of Tokio Kuryu, a second year junior-high student. Presented through manga-style visuals, the game's story promises to clear up the mysteries from past entries. Over 100 characters from past .hack games, anime, manga, and books will make an appearance.[CR]Gameplay promises to retain the basics of past titles, with players facing off in battle against enemies as they explore dungeons. The difference here is that you move around in a party of two, with the CPU-controlling the other character. The game will include 33 such CPU-controlled characters. For the PSP game, the battle system has been changed to a more action-heavy combat system.</plot>

		<plot>AKB1/48: Idol to Koishitara... is a romance adventure game featuring all the girls from AKB48 pop idol group. The story begins in a dreamlike situation where all the girls are in love with you, but in the end, you will have to choose only one. AKB48 (AKB is abbreviation of Akihabara, an electronic town in Tokyo) is a j-pop idol group with 48 members in total. Members aren't constant and their popularity is based on votes by the fans of the group. This is the first game in the series and takes place in Tokyo (background images during visual-novel style gameplay are photos from various known locations in Tokyo).[CR]The game mostly plays like a visual novel which features real-life locations and actual idols in various poses over the background image instead of anime art. The game progresses one day at the time where you spend with one of the idols, either on a date or in casual talk. The player is given a list of letters sent to you by AKB48 girls with their profiles. Based on who sent you the message, you can reply to it which eventually leads you to a date with that person. You can use the phone to call the person of interest and set a date. During the date part which plays as a visual novel, there will be a dialogue selection which will show the girl you're with if you're rude, indifferent or like her. This in turn may prompt her to contact you again at the beginning of the next day. Some correspondence occurs irregularly when the girl liked how she felt when she was with you on previous dates. Likewise, addresses of the girls you were rude with will disappear from the list until only one remains. Initially, all 48 girls are listed as your potential girlfriends. During special so called escort event scenes, idols will wear a special outfit just for you. Any event scene during visual novel gameplay lets on-screen text be toggled off and allows for certain amount of zooming.[CR]Various unlockables such as visual cards, event scenes, and steel photos can accessed from the menu, while collected cards can be traded with other players. AKB48 soundtrack does not need to be unlocked and can be listened via BGM player. It additionally lets the player select default BGM song and theme song for each of the ABK48 members. Voice-acting for each of the AKB48 girls in the game is done by AKB48 members.</plot>

		<plot>Unlike the original game, AKB1/48: Idol to Koishitara..., released a year earlier, this game is sort of a dream where each of the AKB48 idols are in love with you, but you're only be able to select and profess your love to one of them in the end. AKB48 (AKB is abbreviation of Akihabara, an electronic town in Tokyo) is a j-pop idol group with, yes, you guessed it, 48 members in total. Members aren't constant and their popularity is based on votes by the fans of the group. As the title implies, the game takes place in the island of Guam, and idols will wear bikinis a lot, and regular clothes lot less.[CR]The game mostly plays like a visual novel which user real-life locations and actual idols in various poses over the background image instead of anime art. The setting itself is not the only thing differing from the first game. This game features new poses and photo shots with different clothes (the more showing kind) and re-recorded voice-acting by AKB48 members for the new scenario. The game progresses one day at the time where you spend with one of the idols, either on a date or in casual talk. The player is given a list of letters sent to you by AKB48 girls with their profiles. Based on who sent you the message, you can reply to it which eventually leads you to a date with that person.

		<plot>ATV Offroad Fury Pro is an offroad racing game which was released alongside with ATV Offroad Fury 4. Besides the expected ATV (all-terrain vehicles) there are also a variety of other vehicles to race with, e.g. trucks or bikes, which is the foundation of the career mode: participating in a string of championships which are divided in vehicle type and difficulty. Upgrades and additional vehicles are purchased with credits which can be earned in a number of ways: besides price money for winning races, credits are also awarded for performing stunts. There are also three sponsors which offer free upgrades and/or credits for fulfilling their demands regarding performance and stunt rating, but they should be hired with caution because a big penalty is assigned for missed goals. The available types of races are Supercross, Rallycross, National, Freestyle, Circuit, Endurcross, Rally and Snowcross.[CR]Besides a basic course editor and multiplayer for up to four players (which is also the maximum number of racers in single-player) there are also connectivity features with ATV Offroad Fury 4 which allow to exchange courses/vehicles and access a shared online community.</plot>

The money raised can then go on towards the purchase of items for your mech. Weapon upgrades, better shields, even the opportunity to purchase what's called an Exceed Orbit, smaller robot gun emplacements that hover around your mech, giving you an added boost of fire power in the crunch. Four-player deathmatch modes are also included, where players pit souped-up mechs against each other to see who is the last robot standing.[CR]The PSP release includes additional new parts and support for ad-hoc wireless play.</plot>

		<plot>The sequel to Asphalt: Urban GT continues the fast-paced racing of the original game with various additions. Races take place on eight locations all over the world. While racing, smashing other cars, or avoiding the police, there is cash to collect. Money becomes available by risky driving, wiping out opponents or cops, or by picking up items. When a certain cash level is reached, new elements are opened up, such as parts to tune the car (for free), new tracks, new vehicles, or a new game mode. For the first time in the series, bikes are also available.[CR]While racing, a boost meter can be built up by picking up specific items or taking out other cars. A double boost can be applied for high speeds, while a double tap to the right or the left makes the car drift. By ignoring all driving regulations, a wanted meter slowly builds up. The cops will chase with regular patrol cars, helicopters, or they will set up a road block.[CR]The game offers 4 modes:[CR] Evolution: race for the first place.[CR] Duel: race against a single opponent, with a bet. The higher the prize, the tougher the cops are.[CR] Beat 'Em All: win the race by wiping out all opponents before the finish line is reached.[CR] Cop Chase: play as patrol car and wipe out all illegal racers.[CR]The game's theme song is a digitized version of Moby's Lift Me Up (which is also the intro music for UK TV's Formula One racing coverage) and the girls of the pop group The Pussycat Dolls make an appearance before and after each race.</plot>

		<plot>Assassin's Creed: Bloodlines is a PSP-exclusive game that continues the story of the first Assassin's Creed game and also builds up to its sequel Assassin's Creed II. Unlike the Assassin's Creed: Altaïr's Chronicles spin-off for mobile and portable devices, it offers the open world and nonlinear gameplay of the original game.[CR]The game is set one month after the events of the first game and takes place in the two cities Limassol and Kyrenia on the island of Cyprus. The Templars have moved there and Altaïr has followed them to find out what their plans are and to take all of them out if there is an opportunity. The main villain is Armand Bouchart, grand master of the Templars, who is hunting the apple of Eden, which will allow him to control the minds of anyone he chooses.[CR]Gameplay runs on similar vein to the original Assasin's Creed. Altaïr has the ability move freely through each of the cities in the familiar parkour style based on stealth and sneaking up on targets. Players can also opt to have Altaïr simply fight his way in at street level and go in through the front door. Altaïr's arsenal consists of his fists for melee (usually non-lethal) combat, his signature sleeve sword and a longsword.[CR]Bloodlines also features PS3 connectivity via USB, which allows you to unlock six new weapons in Assasin's Creed II when your PSP is hooked up to your PS3. These can also be used in the PSP version. In addition to this, any Templar coins you find in Bloodlines are carried over to Assassin's Creed II, and codex pages will give you a health boost.</plot>

		<plot>Several druids are kidnapped by the Romans and it seems that Getafix has something to do with it. Asterix and Obelix travel to Rome only to find out that Caesar has built a huge amusement park called "Las Vegum" in which he holds the druids captive.[CR]Asterix and Obelix need to fight their way through countless Roman soldiers in order to find and free the druids hidden in the different themed areas of the park. On their way they team up or fight against several game-inspired NPCs like Sam Shieffer or Larry Craft. To fight foes the characters have several attack combos and special items like the famous magic potion at their disposal.[CR]There are also some puzzles, for which you often need to switch between both characters (which you can do at any time) in order to solve them. Asterix, for instance, cannot move a heavy stone out of the way.[CR]The PSP version adds a multiplayer mode: up to four players can play team and objective-based missions, with one team having to complete an objective (like collecting herbs, defending the village, stealing magic potion), the other having to prevent it. AI-controlled team mates join in if not enough players are available.</plot>

Hoshi's great puffs can be used to bounce or control objects in the game world to complete individual challenges... such as diverting pieces of falling fruit into hungry mouths, or blowing creatures around an obstacle course. Competing against other Zwoophs, if Hoshi could win the games he competes in, it would be Bliss.</plot>

		<plot>Bakufū Sentai Bombermen is one of the many, many titles in Hudson's long-running bomb-blasting action series. Taking the reverse approach compared to Bomberman: Act Zero's dark, gritty rework, it reimagines Bomberman as a team of brightly-colored Power Rangers-style bomb-dropping crime-fighting sentai superheroes. The original 8-bit Bomberman also appears in full pixelated 3D glory.[CR]The game itself plays much like any other Bomberman game: Drop bombs to trap and destroy enemies, blow up crates for power-up items, avoid the various hazards on each stage, and try not to get blown up yourself. The story mode sees each member of the Bombermen team play first through several Classic stages as their blocky retro equivalent to regain their powers, then on to more dangerous Arrange stages as their sentai hero form. In Arrange modes, each Bomber has their own unique abilities: Pink Bomber, for example, can jump over blocks and other hazards with proper timing.[CR]The other single-player mode is Challenge mode. This mode is a timed race to score as many points as possible over multiple stages within a strict time limit. There is, of course, also wifi multiplayer for up to five players, and even minigames that can be played by linking with I.Q Mania and XI Coliseum. Also included are demo versions of both of these titles.</plot>

With return of Burnouts feature there were four new game modes added including Maniac Mode (players need to drive dangerously to get highest scores by earning drifts, air, oncoming and near misses. Chaining Burnouts in this mode increases the score multiplier), Drift Challenge (in this mode player need to obtain as many feet of drifting as possible. Chaining Burnouts also increases the score multiplier here), Near Miss Challenge (same as Drift Challenge, but player needs to score near miss bonuses), Burnout Challenge (also same as Drift Challenge, but focusing on obtaining Burnouts score). However, some options have been removed from the game - for instance Burnout Dominator doesn't feature Crash Mode, there is also no Traffic Checking Mode and Online Multiplayer. But PSP version features Burnout HQ where you can upload you score and download new track. The game consists of 12 different tracks, in 8 different real world locations.

		<plot>Buzz!: Brain of the UK is a general knowledge quiz game about the United Kingdom in the long-running Buzz series. Instead of just translating the same questions for each country that is a part of the UK, each country's version has lots of nationally specific questions. For instance, in the British version there are questions on Eastenders or Corrie. It is part of the global Buzz!: Brain of the World brand with 21 different versions for specific countries, such as Buzz!: Brain of Oz for Australia.[CR]In addition to that localized content, Brain of the UK also retains the MyBuzz feature which enables users to create custom quizzes. All quiz packs bought on previous Buzz games are also playable in this version.[CR]The PlayStation 3 version features online play and allows users access to user created questions on the My Buzz! site as well as leaderboards that rank online play.[CR]The PSP version contains a single player game and includes the "pass-around" mode from the previous PSP titles in the series to enable up to 6 players to take part in the same quiz.</plot>

With six new round types specifically designed for PSP including the speed-is-of-the-essence 'Quickfire Challenge', the picture-puzzler 'Picture This' and the mind-boggling 'Virus Challenge', each round also comes complete with pictures and videos .[CR]The focus of Buzz! has always been on social gaming and the PSP version is no different, with three exciting multiplayer modes ideal to play with friends and family. The game features three multiplayer modes that require either one PSP (to pass around) or one copy of the game (thanks to Game Share, users can pass their friends a temporary copy of the game to play to play with up to four players.) Additionally, Quiz Host mode enables up to six players to play against each other, with one taking control of the game to select and ask the questions. The Quiz Host runs the whole game, with the power to award (or even deduct) points however they see fit. Not only does Buzz!

Super Puzzle Fighter II: Y has player's group similar colors to create groups of three or more. Once the colors are line up, they break and charge up the "Change Gem" meter creating furious chains for come-from-behind wins. With the Super Puzzle Fighter II: Z mode, the rules are the same as X, but instead of falling blocks, the play field raises and the first one to the top loses. Block Block is an innovative twist to the block breaking genre. Released for the arcades in 1990, Block Block features a two player co-op mode, allowing for the cooperative destruction of blocks. Also unique to this title was the constantly shrinking paddle that forced player to finish each board as quickly as possible. Originally released for the PlayStation game console, the Buster Bros. Collection is a simple yet extremely addictive three-games-in-one puzzle shooter that consists of Buster Bros, Super Buster Bros and Buster Buddies. An arcade hit, Buster Bros has one or two players navigating through over 50 timed environmental stages shooting all the bubbles on screen while avoiding contact. Super Buster Bros is an updated version of its predecessor with improved graphics and the inclusion of "Panic Mode" which added 99 levels of feverish action.</plot>

		<plot>Chandragupta: Warrior Prince is a 3D action game based on historical events. The game is set in 323 B.C in Ancient India and tells the story of the warrior prince Chandragupta, the Emperor of the Mauryan Empire and the first to unite the territory of what is now known as India.[CR]The game consists of nine levels and there are also some platform elements. The prince can be moved around freely, but there is a linear path to follow. He fights with a sword, a bow etc. and can perform three types of moves that lead to ten different combos. By attacking enemies with combos a gauge is filled up. When it is full reinforcements can be called in for difficult situations and arrows rain down. Collected gold can be used to upgrade weapons. There are also a number of sliding tile puzzles where an image needs to be restored. There are different difficulty levels and a Legend mode with tougher enemies.</plot>

		<plot>Five different gangs are terrorizing the cities, namely Warlords, Capelli Family, Killer66, Vixens, and Convicts. Cities are in chaos as the regular police is helpless. Therefore, a special unit is formed to deal with such a threat, a special unit called the Pursuit Force. You are part of that unit.[CR]Your task is to hunt down the criminals and let none escape. To do so, you will drive your fast car on the streets while being perfectly able to switch the vehicles on the run. Yes, on the run, you can jump from car to car during high speed, usually jumping on the different cars from the criminals and taking them out one by one. But there's more to that than just driving different cars, you can drive motorcycles, trucks, boats, even commandeer a helicopter, though there are occasions you'll have to deal with the criminals on foot.[CR]You can select Time Trial, Race, or Career mode. The latter one plays story-wise which gives you certain variety of cases to choose from. As you get promoted while successfully solving the cases, new cases will become available depending upon your rank, from mere Officer to police Commander. This is a highly fast-paced game with non-stop action, as most missions leave very little room for mistakes.</plot>

		<plot>Long ago, without reason or explanation, the mysterious labyrinths came to be, and the world was changed forever. In a constant state of flux, they sprawl across the world like a web, connecting towns and villages, mountains, lakes, and deserts. Many adventurers delved into these labyrinths dreaming of riches, and those fortunate enough to return did so with amazing stories and unimaginable treasures. It was only natural that the children of the world began to look upon these heroes with unconditional admiration, eager to follow in their footsteps. And so, academies for adventurers were born. Particus Academy may not be the first such school, but we certainly endeavor to be the best! Here at Particus, we strive to equip young men and women with the tools they'll need to become full-fledged adventurers. Bravery, spellcraft, swordplay, 101 ways to avoid dying a horrible death... These and many other lessons and skills await prospective students! We hope your studies here are as enriching and productive as you've dreamed they would be. Over 500 character possibilities - 10 races, 2 genders, 3 alignments, and 15 majors add up to incredible opportunity to customize your party! Change majors for further customization at higher levels. 80 hours of classic dungeon crawling - This is as classic as dungeon crawling gets in an ever-changing 3-D labyrinth containing more than 75 maps full of puzzles, traps, and treasure. Battle hundreds of monster types and uncover over 1300 item types. Flexible alchemy system - Offering more than 400 recipes, this system allows you to synthesize new items from random components found in the labyrinths, as well as customize your weapons' attributes, range, and strength.</plot>

		<plot>When crisp air turns foul, and hideous beasts creep forth to dine on the flesh of innocents, a call will go forth. A call for brave adventurers skilled enough to protect the weak and...cowardly. And when the pale moon runs crimson, and blackness devours the land with a thick fog of death, the call will turn to a howl - a plaintive, pleading shriek. In that desperate moment, the students of Crostini Academy of Adventuring Arts stand ready to quell the darkness with staff and blade. Choose from 10 races and 18 classes to build a party, then dive into dozens of locations with over 100 death-dealing Labyrinth maps crawling with over 250 monsters. Collect artifacts, conquer adversity, explore inter-dimensional travel, cheat death, then get back to campus to collect the “A” on your final!</plot>

		<plot>Cover Girl is aimed at a female audience and it is described as a 'way to become a Truly Fabulous Female'. The game starts by asking some personals details. You enter your name, date of birth, and your favourite music style. You then choose one of the three available female characters that will guide you through the game. The player then gets to access the Cover Girl magazine where the content is customized based on a number of questions. The game for instance asks you whether numbers or letters attempt you more, if you are in the mood for food choices or to release your inner child, and if you are more interested in being dressed to kill than deadweight dumping. The game then generates a Cover Girl magazine based on your preferences.[CR]As a digital magazine the player can then read articles about the behaviour of men, horoscopes, recipes, do a tarot session, answer questions in a sex-o-meter quiz, consult the Manlation to get to know the behaviour of men, complete a Purse-onality quiz to find the perfect purse or do Sudoku puzzles. After going through a number of items a new issue becomes available with new content based on the same themes. It also includes a size translator to compare and convert the different clothes and shoes sizes around the world. There are 25 mini-games in total and over 100 quizzes. Additional magazines were unlocked afterwards and made available through the PlayStation Store.</plot>

		<plot>In Crash of the Titans, players fight a nefarious plot hatched by Crash's arch nemeses Neo and Nina Cortex to mutate the local creatures into titanic abominations. Using Crash's legendary mix of outrageous antics and daredevil bravado, players "hijack" enemies to take control of their action and use their fearsome powers against all manner of enemies. "Jack to Attack!" Control, play and battle as 15 enemies, including titanic creatures such as Scorporilla, Ratcicle, Magamadon and Shellephant. While in control of a monster players can throw toxic stink bombs, call lightning down from the sky, fire lasers beams from their eyes or even impale enemies with a massive scorpion tail - use all of the creatures' special abilities to defeat Neo and Nina Cortex. Crash now has a powerful acrobatic fighting system that includes punches and flying kicks, multiple attacks and special counter moves. Players can power-up skills to unlock new attacks and blazing combos. Crash can now interact with his world in totally new ways. Players can wall-run, swing from ropes and flip off springboards Crash can even toss Aku Aku on the ground to surf, skate, grind and shred. At any point in the game, a second player can join in the fun and play as Carbon-Crash to help unleash total chaos. In a totally innovative twist to co-op action gaming, Crash can even jack Carbon-Crash (or vice versa) for some hysterical Crash "jacked"-Crash mayhem.</plot>

At save points, the player may opt to take one of the available side missions, and if so, Zack is moved to a special area to complete the mission, which usually involves defeating one or more monsters. If the mission is successfully completed, the player is rewarded with beneficial items, and often new missions become available. Whether the player is successful in the side mission or not, upon completion, Zack is returned to the save point in the main game.</plot>

There are 135 levels based on nine themes in total. The different themes (called zones in the game) come with their own contraptions and a specific colour. Dangers include bombs, creatures, sinking surfaces, rotating blocks, blocks that blow the cube backwards and more. Sometimes these also need to be manipulated to create new paths (e.g. moving blocks and then luring a bomb to blow it up).</plot>

		<plot>[I]Disney•Pixar Cars 2[/I] is a racing game based on the animated movie of the same name. The frame story is that Lightning McQueen and his friends are trained in C.H.R.O.M.E. missions, the races, in order to defeat Professor Zundapp. [CR]The main racing event is battle mode in which the player races against opponents and collects power-ups on the way which either allow to perform offensive (machine guns) or defensive (e.g. a shield against enemy attacks) actions as well as speed boosts. There are various other variants of battle mode, including racing against the clock or elimination races. In contrast to the console/PC version, the cars are not freely controlled: the player can only jump between the lanes. The camera angle changes automatically during the race.[CR]During the campaign the player will unlock a number of additional cars which differ in their control, power and speed ratings. Before tackling a new campaign mission, which have different difficulty levels assigned to them, the used car can be changed. The free play mode allows to choose between all racing modes.</plot>

Cosmos and Chaos were of equal strength. It was believed the conflict would last forever. However, the balance is now broken. Those who answered Chaos's call created an inexhaustible force. And under vicious attack without relent, the warriors fighting for Cosmos started to fall one by one. The conflict that has continued for eons is now about to end in Chaos's favor. The world has been torn asunder, sinking into a vortex of disorder. As for the few surviving warriors- their fates have yet to be determined.</plot>

		<plot>Dora-Slot: Kyojin no Hoshi II, is a Pachislot game based on real machines. The theme of the game is based on Japanese manga/anime series Star of the Giants.[CR]The main game consists of 3 different variants of the slot machines, which feature two side bars that interact based on how you score and if you activate any bonuses or meet certain conditions. These feature characters from the series, with voice acting and Japanese humor.[CR]The library allows users to play with the sounds and music, view a catalog about the machine, or even view the staging for various transitions without playing through the game repeatedly. Although, it's still up to luck if you'll complete it, you can hear the voice acting and see the effects that the machine uses in this mode.[CR]Pachislot games are a cross between pachinko machines and western style slot machines. They play more like western style machines, although they often feature mechanical enhancements, animations, mini-games, and various ways of getting bonuses that are more complex than other some other machines.</plot>

		<plot>The game's story mode is based on the events of the movie Dragon Ball Z: Fusion Reborn. The choices the player makes in the story determine how the story evolves.[CR]Another mode is the Arcade mode, a single-player mode that lets you brawl against the CPU in order to fight and gain the Dragon Balls. Next is the Z trial mode, which consists of two different types of play: survival, where you fight against CPU-controlled opponents for as long as you can, and time attack, where you see how fast you can make it through a predetermined set of opponents.[CR]Finally, there’s the Profile Card mode in which the players will have their in-game character profile cards that lists their name and power level. The player can design their own card and customize them with the items from the game's item store.</plot>

		<plot>Driver '76 is the fifth game in the Driver series and the first since Ubisoft acquired the license from Atari. The game is a prequel to Driver: Parallel Lines, set two years before the events, and features two side characters from Parallel Lines: Ray (controlled by the player) and Slink. Ray has set his eyes on the daughter of a Triad boss and tries to impress him by taking on tough jobs. This gets him in a lot of trouble with the other gangs, and the story, divided over 6 chapters, is presented in comic-book style.[CR]There are 27 missions, set in New York, from New Jersey to Coney Island, with several distinguishable districts, and over 40 customizable vehicles, from dirt bikes to sports cars and big rigs, and some surprises such as the Ghostbusters' Ecto-1 - all with different handling. Players have complete freedom to move about, but the mission structure is linear. Tasks include time-limited runs, escorting and evading missions. Ray can also move on foot, and wreak havoc with a number of guns, along with locked targetting.[CR]During the main game the characters can accept side jobs to earn additional cash, such as closed-course or open-road racing, driving a tow-truck, a taxi or an ambulance, and money can be spend in the garage to upgrade the vehicles.[CR]Multiplayer is supported for up to 2 players over WiFi with Street Racing, Carnage, Circuit Racing, Pink Slip Racing and Swap Meet. Players can also swap items over W-Lan or download new paint jobs. Next to the main game, there are also a few minigames.</plot>

		<plot>The former king of Oddesia has entrusted you with an important, dangerous task. You must find the sacred ORA stone, which possesses the powers of life, light and happiness, and retrieve it before the king of the alien race, Natas, does. He has conquered this land and plunged it into an age of terror and despair, plagued with violence. It is up to you to stand against him and return your world to its former glory.[CR][I]Dungeon Explorer[/I] plays like Gauntlet: you choose one of several different characters to play as (Fighter, Thief, Warlock, Witch, Bard, Bishop, Elf and Knome) and set out on your adventure alone or with up to four other players. Battles are real-time and of the shooter variety, ie, rather than swing a sword, you fire knives (or spells depending on your class). Enemies respawn out of holes in the ground which must be eradicated to keep them from pouring forth in waves. There are a number of items to be found and used throughout the game including potions of white and black magic, healing drinks and the like, but unlike [I]Gauntlet[/I] there is no food to worry about.</plot>

		<plot>Dungeons and Dragons Tactics is a fantasy role-playing game, utilizing the 3.5 Edition core rule set, which takes place in the eastern border reaches of the Lindesi, a group of kingdoms governed by a human High-King far to the West,[CR]Players begin a campaign by selecting or creating a character to be the hero, then selecting, or creating a group of companions to form the party. At the start, you may only have five companions in your party, but as the campaign continues, you may recruit up to eleven companions. You may select pre-generated characters, create your own group of characters for the party, or even use the quick-start option which will automatically provide you with a set of pre-generated characters. If the main hero you create or select for the campaign dies, the campaign will end. You may select from all eleven core character classes: barbarian, bard, cleric, druid, fighter, monk, paladin, ranger, rogue, sorcerer, and wizard, plus the psionic warrior and psion. Additional party members you may recruit during the adventure are found in the marketplace, for example, you may recruit clerics and paladins at the Temple, and fighters, barbarians and psychic warriors may be recruited at the Mercenary Hall.[CR]The adventure is played by moving the party icon along the map, where you make choices on which locations to enter, and with whom you may interact, but combat is handled in turn-based tactics fashion, on a grid with five-foot squares, where initiative determines the order when each character moves, and each character during their turn may perform actions according to the 3.5 Edition combat rules. Each character, however, has several options during their turn from the Action menu. Spells and psionics are also available for the appropriate characters. For those unfamiliar with the 3.5 Edition rule set, the manual has a glossary of D&amp;D; rules terms and there is a glossary available from the main menu in the game.[CR]Wireless multiplayer mode allows you to host or join a game with up to four players, featuring game modes such as Dungeon Bash, or Deathmatch Battle, but you are only permitted to use pre-generated characters.</plot>

As an officer in a Chinese army (Wei, Wu or Shu armies), you fight and kill thousands of soldiers in massive battles stretched over numerous battlefields - either in the campaign "Musou" modes or the single battle "Free" mode which can be used to train.[CR]Each stage consists of a map split in numerous areas. From the map, the player selects an area he has access to (areas are connected to each other in certain directions, and the player can only move to an area connected to the one he his currently in); if the area has enemy units, a battle field similar to the ones in the main Dynasty Warriors games, albeit smaller, will load. In each areas, the enemy squads must be eliminated for the area to be liberated. When such an area is under enemy control, bonuses such as supplies that increase the remaining time to complete the stage, are acquired. As characters defeats enemies, they gain experience points and level-up.[CR]New to this PSP version is a bodyguard system where your selected second officer can give you certain items or abilities, for example one ensures you always have a horse when entering an area, and others can give you special powered up Musou attacks.</plot>

Like its predecessor, the game retells the story from Luo Guangzhong's Romance of the Three Kingdoms by having the player control an officer from the Wu, Wei or Shu kingdoms through the most important battles of each kingdom's storyline. The playable characters and their appearance are taken from Dynasty Warriors 5.[CR]Each scenario has branching stages, which can be be unlocked by playing the same scenario but choosing a different path. Each battle can then be played in free mode.[CR]The battles consist of a map separated in numerous smaller areas. These areas can be allied or enemy camps, supply depots, or open fields. The player has to move from area to area, entering a battlefield when the area is under enemy control or is attacked by the enemy army. Defeating enemy officers and squads until their troop's morale drops to 0 will liberate the area, sometimes yielding rewards such as supplies, which add to the total time of the battle, uncover hidden areas, or refill some health.[CR]Before each stage, the player can equip a different weapon and mount, and choose up to four generic officers to accompany the selected character. Each of these officers has a level, rank, squadron units, and special abilities that will influence the outcome of the battle. Which officer can be selected depends on the player character's command stat. If the command number is 30, it means that officers with a combined level of 30 can be selected.[CR]In battle, the player has to defeat as many foes as possible by combining regular attacks and charge attacks, and unleashing the series' signature Musou attack. Different weapons allow for more combo attacks and higher attack strength. By defeating enemies, the character will gain experience and level up. However, the level resets between battle, and the gained experience is converted into points to raise the officers ranks. Once a stage's winning conditions are met, the army is deemed victorious, but if the player character is defeated, supplies get exhausted or the main camp is taken, the game is over. Upon victory, the player is rewarded with new officers and weapons or mounts acquired in battle.[CR]New playable characters are unlocked by completing the Musou mode. Different characters get unlocked depending on which scenario is played, and which battles are won.[CR]Other than the Musou (Story) mode, the game has a Free mode, and Multiplayer mode. The Multiplayer mode allows for up to four players via Ad Hoc and offers different games: Bombs Away, Battle Royal, Time Attack and Sudden Death.</plot>

		<plot>Sony Computer Entertainment introduces a new concept in trading card games with THE EYE OF JUDGMENT™ developed exclusively for PLAYSTATION®3 computer entertainment system. Utilizing Hasbro® and its Wizards of the Coast subsidiary's trading card expertise, the immense power of the PS3® system, and the PLAYSTATION®Eye, Sony's groundbreaking next-generation USB camera for PS3, THE EYE OF JUDGMENT provides a visually stunning experience that adds a third dimension to the trading card game genre.Developed by Sony Computer Entertainment Worldwide Studios, JAPAN Studio, THE EYE OF JUDGMENT presents a new style of gameplay where collectable trading cards, embedded with a CyberCode, are brought to life in the 3D game through use of the innovative PLAYSTATION Eye. Players compete by selecting a card and placing the coded card in front of the PLAYSTATION Eye for their respective creatures to come to life and battle on screen. Players take turns placing cards as they jostle for control; the winner is the first player to conquer five of the nine squares of the "9 Fields" battle mat. The gamers task is to conquer the board by deploying their cards more skillfully than their opponent.Players have four ways to play THE EYE OF JUDGMENT, single player against their PS3, against an opponent in two-player mode, against an opponent online, or letting the PS3 play out a round with the cards the player owns. THE EYE OF JUDGMENT comes with a starter deck of 30 character and spell cards manufactured by Hasbro.</plot>

		<plot>Hundreds of new animation sequences and a new collision detection system with 360 degree coverage enable players to behave according to their physical attributes. Player speed, direction and strength now determine everything from the severity of the collision to the outcome of possession. Plus, contact occurs with shoulders, arms and legs. Stronger players possess the strength to knock down smaller players or use their body and arms to shield the ball in challenges. Changes to the animation system reward the skillful gamer during one-on-one situations between attackers and defenders. Tuned acceleration attributes enable swifter players to possess quicker first steps and gain advantage in sprints. Plus, four new skill moves -- scoop turns, rainbow flicks, heel-to-heel knocks and ball rolls - give you a total of 32 tricks in your arsenal to perform just like Ronaldinho. From the moment you step onto the pitch, FIFA 09 challenges you to think and react like a real football player through the popular feature innovation Be A Pro -- now expanded to multiple seasons and featuring the unique Be A Pro camera that tracks your player, re-creating the excitement and rush of racing in on goal. In Be A Pro: Seasons you choose a professional player and then develop his skills at a single outfield position. Complete individual challenges to develop your player attributes and win glory for the squad. Enjoy top football action at your own level of ability with new Smart Play controls. Passionate football fans new to gaming can play like a professional, controlling only the shooting and passing using a two-button control system and gradually mastering all of the controls as they become adept. With new smart play controls and an assist from the AI, gamers can learn at their own pace and still play entertaining matches with more advanced players.</plot>

Players will be distinguished from one another through a sophisticated database that evaluates and grades each player's skill-set over 36 attributes and 57 traits, compiled by 1700 scouts around the world. Real Madrid's Kaka will deliver crisp, creative passes, Barcelona's Andres Iniesta will utilize tighter turns and close control to dribble through defenses, Manchester United's Wayne Rooney will hold off defenders and strike shots from distance with pace, and top-flight defenders like Giorgio Chiellini of Juventus will anticipate, predict and react to offensive players to win back possession.Goalkeepers have also been injected with Personality+. The real-life personality of the keeper, whether acrobatic or traditional, will dictate his style in game. Dive attributes will determine the keepers with the ability to reach for further shots while reflex attributes determine reaction times, so a keeper like Petr Cech of Chelsea FC will show be able to showcase world-class skills.</plot>

		<plot>FIFA Soccer 07 is the third appearance of the soccer series on the PSP. It builds upon the previous year's version with updated rosters, new control options and new game modes.[CR]The game includes 27 leagues from 20 countries (adding the Turkish league), plus various rest-of-the-world and international teams, the same selection as in the console version. Returning modes include Kick-Off for friendlies, tournaments and challenges (with 31 new comeback and 30 new rout challenges) and wi-fi multiplayer (ad-hoc and infrastructure). The manager mode, already an established feature in the console versions, makes its debut on the PSP in this game. It tasks players with managing a club team, taking care of sponsors, the club board, and fan relations in addition to success on the pitch. PSP manager careers are compatible with those from the PS2 version and can be exchanged via PS2-PSP link. Exclusive to the PSP version is player training via mini-games (which are also available on their own): the returning Juggling and the new Wall Attack. In Wall Attack, the goal is to kick the ball at a wall of colored blocks for points, with a certain number necessary within a time limit to advance to the next level. Some blocks contain icons that have additional effects, like clearing neighboring blocks or blocks of the same color.[CR]Among the new control options are chip shots and various new configurations: there is a choice between player control via analog stick or d-pad (or both, but without on-the-fly tactics changes) and optional PES-style button layout.</plot>

		<plot>The Griffin family from Fox's animated TV series makes its way to video gaming for the first time.[CR]In this action-adventure, which runs like an episode from the show, players control Peter, Brian and Stewie through various goals and adventures.[CR]After being hit on the head by a satellite dish, Peter wakes up in a hospital believing that Mr. Belvedere (from the 1980's sitcom) has kidnapped his family, and everyone in town is an accomplice. Peter makes his way through town beating up anyone who gets in his path, in a side-scrolling beat-em-up fighting mode.[CR]Brian is falsely accused of impregnating Carter Pewterschmidt's prized racing dog Seabreeze. Brian must escape the police station without being seen and collect evidence proving that he is not the father. Brian's game mode relies heavily on stealth/espionage gameplay.[CR]Stewie's battle against his half-brother Bertram continues as Stewie must destroy everything in his path to infiltrate a hospital and the inside of Peter in order to find Bertram's lair and stop him from taking over the world. Stewie's adventure takes place as a platformer action game with shooting elements.[CR]Much like the show, there are segues which translate into mini-games that will yield power-ups for each mission if completed successfully.</plot>

		<plot>Fast-paced and strategic, Fat Princess: Fistful of Cake pits two hordes of players against each other in a comic medieval battle on the PSP. The player's goal is to rescue a beloved princess from the enemy castle. There is a catch, though; the adversary has been feeding her magical cake to make her heavier to carry. Therefore, it will take much of the army working together to carry her across the battlefield. Team balance and strategy is crucial in Fat Princess: Fistful of Cake because players can switch between five different character classes, literally, at the drop of a hat. The name of the game is cooperation, whether it is flinging another player over the enemy's walls with a teeterboard, healing him while he charges into battle, or adding muscle to carry the hearty princess to safety. The comical, quirky, and loveable cast of characters in Fat Princess: Fistful of Cake has been developed specifically for optimization on the PSP. Now players can have their cake and take it on the go, too.</plot>

Outside of the ring, gamers can establish intense rivalries through pre-fight events putting purpose and passion behind every hit. Three new Impact Punches a la the EA Sports Haymaker keep gamers at the edge of their seat as players are only one punch away from the entire dynamic of the fight changing. Land a perfectly timed Flash KO or jump into a quick mid-fight mini-game to land a humiliating knockdown punch. Thrown using EA Sports Fight Night's innovative analog punch system, Impact Punches are high risk and high reward - put down your opponent or get knocked on the canvas. Boxing's Greatest Rivalries - Watch ESPN Classic footage of real-life bouts or re-create the greatest fights from past and present including Arturo Gatti vs. Mickey Ward, Marco Antonio Barrera vs. Eric Morales, and Ali vs. Frasier. Establish intense rivalries of your own by intimidating opponents before the big fight with heated press conferences full of hype, trash talkin', and fights at weigh-ins. Relive the best rivalries of your career in ESPN's Instant Classics! Create a style of your own, then see how you match up against the authentic signature styles from the world's best fighters. Licensed boxers use tactics and strategies that match their real life counterparts. Self Determinant AI adapts its style to match user strengths and to exploit weaknesses.</plot>

Each stage has a gem requirement, and you can exit when you have found the required amount. The puzzles are usually based on colored gems that open specific doors.[CR]There are six worlds (including a tutorial) where you get past hazards such as water and quick sands, avoid patrolling creatures, collect gems, manipulate crates, sneak around, build bridges, and plant explosives. There are also power-ups that allow you to walk over certain surfaces, increase speed, or provide invincibility. With short levels, Frantix can be played for five minutes or an hour with the same satisfaction.</plot>

		<plot>Freak Out: Extreme Freeride is an arcade skiing game, focused on performing tricks and stunts. The main mode is Mission, where players need to jump gaps, make tricks, grind rails and pick stars. Completing the different challenges is rewarded with money, exchanged for basic equipment (skis, boots, helmets) and style equipment (jackets, goggles, gloves) at the shop. It also opens up new slopes and mountains. In Freeride the aim is to get the highest score, opening up slopes and mountains, there are four mountains in total, and earning endurance points. Bone Ride has the player collect bones against a time limit to earn balance points and beating courses in the Slope Style mode requires the player to reach a pre-defined score to receive trick skill points. These different game modes are grouped in the main Career, Single race and Multiplayer sections.[CR]Mostly about tricks, players need to take care of their landings - touch the ground with back, front or side weight and a lower score multiplier is awarded. Next to the basic information on the screen such as time, score and stunts, the game also keeps track of your "flow", by doing consecutive tricks. There are six different characters and the arsenal of tricks includes flips, rolls, carve/cross skis, grabs, rails, jumps and specials.</plot>

		<plot>Free Running is a third-person open-environment arcade game, based around the sport of Parkour.[CR]Set across multiple high and low rise urban environments, Parkour participants (known as traceurs) navigate around and over various obstacles using only the natural abilities of the human body. By stringing together spectacular gymnastic style moves, the player builds up 'flow', and is awarded points according to their agility and grace.[CR]In the single player story mode, the players creates a novice traceur, who is mentored by Parkour athletes from Urban Freeflow, and by the Parkour guru Sebastian Foucan.[CR]In addition, there are numerous single and multiplayer challenge modes - races, collection events, style based challenges, timed events and more.[CR]Successful completion of challenges unlocks new levels, videos, clothing, footwear and music tracks.</plot>

		<rom name="redump.psp/Frogger - Helmet Chaos (Europe) (En,Fr,De,Es,It).zip" size="169287254"/>
		<plot>Frogger: Helmet Chaos is a top-down platform game with the eighties' arcade frog as the protagonist, but now in 3d. The basic gameplay is still the game, as the frog moves one (invisible) square per key press, which maintains the feel of the original arcade game instead of the modern, smoother movement mechanics.[CR]When Frogger climbs a tree to get some moonfruit for Toady, his friend is gone when he returns. He follows his footprints and finds out Toady is under the control of Dr. Wani, who has ordered his mini-crocs to place mind-control helmets on all residents of the land. It is up to Frogger to undo this.[CR]The game consists of different small levels with puzzle elements. Frogger can be moved around with one square per movement, or two for a regular jump. This mechanic is most often used to navigate maze-like platforms with water. Ironically, Frogger drowns when touching liquid. While moving around he can collect coins and there are checkpoints to save progress. He can use his tongue to push or pull objects, or swing from branches. There is also a vertical jump to reach objects mid-air and he can turn 90 degrees to face a different direction. The frog has a limited amount of lives, but one can be restored by picking up an apple.[CR]The story is continued through drawn cut-scene sequences with static images and voice-overs (on the PSP, there is only written text for the DS version). The PSP version supports game sharing, while the DS top screen shows the game statistics while playing the story mode. There are also seven mini-games, including the original arcade Frogger but with polished graphics, and hats and costumes to unlock with the collected coins.</plot>

		<plot>Full Auto 2: Battlelines is the sequel to the auto racing combat game Full Auto, that debuted in February of 2006 on the Xbox 360. [CR]The PSP version of the sequel builds on the PS3 version but removes a few features for obvious reasons, resulting in more primitive damage modeling on the cars, less detailed environments and less multiplayer modes. This version does add new gameplay modes, new cars, weapons and a different storyline.[CR]The game plays much like a mixture of Burnout and Twisted Metal. The PSP version focuses more on the Twisted Metal-style combat gameplay. During most events, winning a race is rarely a goal; the game is focused on destruction. The goals change from level to level, but most time they require eliminating a set number of enemies, or blowing up specific targets, random objects, or oncoming traffic. Unlike the PS3 version every objective needs to be completed to win the event.[CR]The game contains two general game modes: Racing and Arena. The 'Unwreck' feature is also present and it allows the player to rewind time. The environment is however much less interactive. Most objects cannot be destroyed, only specific ones, for instance a lead pipe that lands on chasing cars. Most destruction is done to store fronts, bus stops, trash cans and other objects.[CR]The game contains four-player Ad Hoc multiplayer. Players can race or fight in a free-for-all arena or as part of a team in multiplayer modes such as Head-On, Down and Back, as well as Arena Deathmatch.</plot>

		<plot>Ghost Rider is an action game set after the events of the movie of the same name, which is in turn based on the Marvel Comics character.[CR]You are Johnny Blaze, who sold his soul to a demon named Mephisto for noble reasons. Now, some rogue demons have escaped from hell and Mephisto needs to to destroy them before they cause him trouble. If you don't, he'll take your girlfriend back to hell with him.[CR]Ghost Rider attacks with his flaming hellfire chains in a manner similar to God of War. If he uses a variety of moves and avoids being hit, it fills a vengeance bar. The more this meter fills, the more souls he gets from enemies he kills. Souls are used to purchase new moves and extras like additional characters. There are some shielded enemies where you must have a minimum vengeance bar to damage them. There is also a spirit gauge, which is essentially a special meter and is also built up by attacking. It allows the uses of special moves, like your shotgun.[CR]There are also Hellcycle levels, where you must successfully avoid obstacles while destroying enemies with the bike's hellshots attacks and your chains. This version of the game additionally includes a challenge mode which is based on the Hellcycle levels with rule variations: elimination and survival (every racer has a depleting life bar which can be only refilled by driving through checkpoints).</plot>

		<plot>The game is set in Ancient Greece and loosely based on its mythology. The player controls Kratos, a Spartan warrior in the service of the Olympian Gods. Kratos is guided by the goddess Athena, who instructs him to find the Sun God Helios, as the Dream God Morpheus has caused the remaining gods to slumber in Helios' absence. With the power of the sun, Morpheus and Persephone, the Queen of the Underworld, with the aid of the Titan Atlas, intend to destroy the Pillar of the World and in turn Olympus. God of War: Chains of Olympus is chronologically the second chapter in the series, which focuses on vengeance as its central theme.[CR]Chains of Olympus is a prequel set ten years before the original God of War. Gameplay is similar to the predecessors but with some minor changes. Kratos goes through levels killing enemies and bosses, solving box-based puzzles and doing quick time events. He also collects red orbs to power up his weapons and abilities, Gorgon eyeballs to increase his health and Phoenix feathers to increase his magic power.[CR]The game's controls were adjusted to fit the PSP's reduced amount of buttons. Both the shoulder buttons and the analog stick are now required in order to dodge. The most well-known God of War weapon, the Blades of Chaos, are also present. There are several new weapons and magic spells available, including Sun Shield, Efreet spell and Light of Dawn. The game starts when the Gods send Kratos to the city of Attica to defend it from the invading Persian army. But later when Morpheus strikes, Kratos will need to use all his power to save the world once again.</plot>

		<plot>While these three nations vie for continental domination, one captain must choose a nation with which to align him/herself, then recruit teams of able-bodied soldiers and train them into battle-ready knights to send off into the ever-changing online war campaign. It is up to players to choose an allegiance with one of the three factions, then progress through offline questing and intense 30-hour online skirmishes, all making use of deep, strategic RPG combat and expansive customization. Race, sex, appearance, job class, sub-class and weapon type are all freely alterable for every team member, so no two knights are ever the same; and unique massively-multiplayer online functionality allows players to test their knights against others from all corners of North America, without even requiring a constant internet connection.</plot>

		<plot>Gundam Battle Tactics, released on September 22, 2005, is a third-person action/mech-combat simulation game for the PlayStation Portable, based on Japan's long-running mecha-based series, Gundam. Tactics, released only in Japan and South Korea, was later followed with a sequel, Gundam Battle Royale, also for the PlayStation Portable, in late 2006. This game follows the events of the One Year War and most scenarios are heavily influenced by animation episodes from One Year War storylines, namely Mobile Suit Gundam, The 08th MS Team, War in the Pocket, and Blue Destiny. This game plays similarly to another Bandai Gundam game for the Sony PlayStation 2, Mobile Suit Gundam: Lost War Chronicles.</plot>

		<plot>In a land ravaged by disparity where the impoverished must battle for survival, the fate of all is thrust into uncertainty when rebels happen upon custody of a young female noble and a magical spear of immeasurable power falls from the heavens. Now, hunted by incumbent powers desperate to reclaim the girl and armed with a weapon capable of reshaping the realm, the Resistance must wage war to deliver themselves from the tyranny of their oppressors.[CR]As original as its narrative, Gungnir's strategy RPG mechanics offer a number of fresh twists on an expertly honed formula. Building upon the traditional action queue of turn-based strategy RPGs, actions in Gungnir all have a numerical wait interval associated with them. Faster actions bear smaller numbers, allowing them to precede slower preexisting attacks. Should the player wish, they may sacrifice tactical points, which afford them more combat options, in order to accelerate actions. This classic balance of risk and reward, a staple of Sting titles, enriches the Gungnir's deep strategic battles and gives the player far more critical decisions to weigh.</plot>

		<plot>Gurumin: A Monstrous Adventure is a 3D platform game with an emphasis on action and platforming with puzzle elements. It stars a 12 year old girl named Parin who needs to move in with her grandfather, the mayor of a mining town called Tiese, as her parents go overseas on an excavation. Parin felt fine about moving in with her grandfather until she hears that she is the only kid in the town and has nobody to play with. Nonetheless her grandfather suggests that she goes exploring the town and stopping by to see Fan, the woman who runs the town bakery, to see if she can be friends with her.[CR]After visiting the shops and exploring what little Tiese has to offer, Parin is surprised to find a girl being attacked by a stray dog. Parin hurries to rescue the girl but quickly finds out that the girl she rescued is actually not a girl at all, but a monster named Pino. Parin is then taken through a hidden entrance near her house by Pino and her brother, Puku, where she meets the rest of monsters in Monster Village and finally finds some friends to play with. Unfortunately, soon after Puku is kidnapped by evil creatures called phantoms and it's up to Parin to rescue him, so the other monsters provide her with the only weapon they have, a legendary drill.[CR]As Parin makes her way through the first dungeon to rescue Puku, the phantoms attack Monster Village which puts the whole world at risk. It is now up to Parin to make her way through more dungeons to restore Monster Village and save the world.[CR]Parin's drill has four power levels that build as she fights, or at restoration points, and the decreases as she receives damage. Parin can also equip accessories that have various abilities such as increasing defense or giving her a larger numbers of coins as she defeats enemies. Coins and junk are two forms of currency in the game that are used to acquire and upgrade accessories or learn new attacks. Coins can be found easily in pots or are dropped by enemies, however junk can only be acquired when dropped by enemies that were carrying an item such as a shield.</plot>

		<plot>In Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Voldemort is tightening his grip on both the Muggle and wizarding worlds and Hogwarts is no longer the safe haven it once was. Harry suspects that dangers may even lie within the castle, but Dumbledore is more intent upon preparing him for the final battle that he knows is fast approaching. Together they work to find the key to unlock Voldemort's defenses and, to this end, Dumbledore recruits his old friend and colleague, the well-connected and unsuspecting bon vivant Professor Horace Slughorn, whom he believes holds crucial information. Meanwhile, the students are under attack from a very different adversary as teenage hormones rage across the ramparts. Harry finds himself more and more drawn to Ginny, but so is Dean Thomas. And Lavender Brown has decided that Ron is the one for her, only she hadn't counted on Romilda Vane's chocolates! And then there's Hermione, simmering with jealously but determined not to show her feelings. As romance blossoms, one student remains aloof. He is determined to make his mark, albeit a dark one. Love is in the air, but tragedy lies ahead and Hogwarts may never be the same again. In the game, players will return to Hogwarts to help Harry survive a fraught sixth year. They will also have a chance to engage in exciting wizard duels, mix and brew magical ingredients in Potions class and take to the air to lead the Gryffindor Quidditch team to victory. Players may even get sidetracked by Ron's romantic entanglements as they journey towards a dramatic climax and discover the identity of the Half-Blood Prince.</plot>

Use strategy to take down hordes of enemies - toss a straggler into the crowd or manipulate the environment to create more manageable groups of enemies.

		<plot>The goal of the game is clean and simple: As the God of Destruction, you must create a dungeon that is difficult and powerful enough to fend off human hero invasions. The dungeon must have a self-sustaining ecosystem, so players must strategically dig and create a dungeon with a balanced food chain. Periodically, human heroes will invade the dungeon in order to bring peace and harmony to the world, but they are your enemies. You must destroy the heroes before they capture the Overlord and take him back to the surface.</plot>

		<plot>Ultimate Racing is the first game in the series of Hot Wheels licensees to appear on the PSP platform. Just like the other games, it is a straightforward racing game with a focus on arcade gameplay. The game offers three game modes:[CR]Ultimate Challenge: win races to unlock new cars, tracks, challenges and performance upgrades.[CR]Arcade Mode: quick play based on the unlocked content from the Ultimate Challenge mode.[CR]Multiplayer Mode: quick races or checkpoint-based races for up to four players[CR]In Ultimate Challenge, there are six main stages to choose from, with eleven tracks and twenty licensed cars in total. The game starts from a central warehouse where all unlocked cars are stored. These can be upgraded or customized in the garage. Next to the performance upgrades, players can tweak the colors of the body, glass, neon, wheels, and change the wheels and decals.[CR]The Arcade Mode is further divided into different challenges: Quick Race, Survival Mode (complete a series of increasingly difficult races and avoid being kicked out), Collector (checkpoint-based races) and Time Trial.[CR]Next to regular racing controls such as brakes and acceleration, players can also use NOS (boost) and Slow Motion (slow down time during difficult sections). The use is limited as it depletes a reserve. It can be refilled by passing by obstacles without hitting them or completing tricky jumps. Tracks, with themes such as Volcano, Jungle or Death Valley, are generally filled with obstacles, moving objects or animals. The focus is entirely on racing, there are no weapons or other offensive means and the cars can only be slowed down, unable to sustain damage.[CR]There are three different camera settings and ghost cars are supported during time trials.</plot>

The focus is entirely on racing, there are no weapons or other offensive means and the cars can only be slowed down, unable to sustain damage.[CR]There are three different camera settings and ghost cars are supported during time trials.</plot>

		<plot>Sega returns players to the technologically empowered role of Tony Stark, for another third-person action-adventure through the Marvel universe. Iron Man 2 is based on the 2010 feature film and released alongside its theatrical debut. Following the style of the publisher's original movie-based Iron Man game, the sequel features high-speed flight sequences, high-powered weaponry, and challenging battles against outnumbering forces and formidable supervillain characters.[CR]The control scheme has been refined from the original game, with developers taking player feedback into consideration. Iron Man can perform new martial arts moves in the sequel, allowing players to engage in hands-on combat with powerful bosses.The game's environments are more completely destructible, creating new offensive possibilities as well as defensive concerns. Additional weapons become available to help players meet these new challenges.[CR]The game's story was authored by comic book writer Matt Fraction, and combines plot elements from the film with Iron Man comic book lore. In a side plot not featured in the movie, the hero fights his regular comic book rival, the battle-suited Crimson Dynamo. High-stakes challenges threaten ultimate defeat through each chapter of action, and the game concludes with the fate of the entire world once again in the weapon-clad hands of the invincible Iron Man.</plot>

		<plot>Jet de GO! Pocket is the third installment of Taito's flight simulation series for Sony consoles and the first one to be released on PSP. The first title in the series, Jet de GO!, was released on PlayStation in 2000 and its sequel, simply titled "Jet de GO! 2", was released on PlayStation 2 in 2002.[CR]Just like its predecessors, the game allows the player to take the captain's chair in the cockpit of a commercial airliner making flights to and from major Japanese cities such as Tokyo, Osaka and Sapporo. The game features a variety of airplanes such as the Boeing B747, B777 and B767, different weather and daytime conditions and flight plans. The player can choose between three game modes: Flight, Trial and Replay.[CR]Since the game is endorsed by Japan Airlines, a real world airline, it is not actually possible to "crash" an airplane. Collisions with the ground are shown in a simplified fashion where the plane simply stops once it touches down, resulting in a "Game Over" screen.[CR]Although the game was only released in Japan, it features partially English menus.</plot>

		<plot>A franchise spin-off of the of the previously released PlayStation Network (PSN) hit, echochrome, echoshift shares echochrome's unique puzzle concept, however brings a new gaming style as well as visual appeal to players who are tasked to strategically maneuver a mannequin-like figure through each level while solving intricate puzzles within a certain amount of time. Because the puzzles are impossible to complete on your own the first time through, players will need to cooperate with "ghosts" of their previous attempts to help clear each level. The more the player starts over, the more ghosts appear. It is up to the player to strategically use these multiple ghosts to help them through the level and reach the goal.</plot>

		<plot>For thousands of years, the people of Jikandia were happy and peaceful, utterly ignorant of the concept of time. Then...one day, uncountable hordes of dangerous creatures appeared, bringing chaos to Jikandia and setting the wheels of time turning once again. Plunged suddenly into this newly-temporal reality, the people of Jikandia fell into confusion, terror, and anarchy. In the midst of the mayhem gripping the land, an ancient spirit known as Temtem, hoping to restore peace and harmony to the troubled land, somehow gained mastery over time and space. With this new-found power, Temtem attempted to summon the nine heroes of legend. Nine kids on their way to school found themselves summoned through time and space to become the champions of Jikandia. However, only Hall, who was separated from his friends while traveling through the void, appeared before Temtem. Neither of them knew what had happened to Hall's friends, but it soon become clear that Hall had to find them, and right Jikandia's wrongs, if he was ever to return home. In Jikandia, you must travel through dungeons in search of your friends. You can set the time limit for each dungeon yourself! Dungeons are altered in several ways according to the time limit you set, so no adventure is the same twice! The longer you spend in one, the more likely you'll come across rare items and treasure chests...but you'll also face more monsters and difficult traps. Also, by meeting certain requirements, you can unlock specific events and cause legendary items to appear. Activating the "Focus" mode will make you stronger, faster, and more powerful! Obtain magic orbs to customize your heroÃi¿½ÃÂ¯Ãi¿½ÃÂ¿Ãi¿½ÃÂ½s skills as you wish. Up to four PSP systems can be linked to play in the Jikandia Coliseum timed stages where you can battle against your friends and dodge traps to win with the highest score!</plot>

		<plot>In Killzone: Liberation, two months after the events of "Killzone," (PS2) most of southern Vekta is still under Helghast control. The rules of war have been cast aside with the Helghast General, Metrac, employing brutal measures in order to seize the initiative and strengthen his position further. Returning as Templar, players will be sent on a mission to undertake a covert operation to save hostages captured by Metrac, while ISA troops continue the fight for liberty. Featuring an intelligent third person camera system, Killzone: Liberation allows players a more tactical surveillance viewpoint to view their action and read the enemy's behavior during gameplay. Set in an intense postmodern war reminiscent of the previous PS2 title, Killzone: Liberation features the unique graphical style to showcase pure grit and realism. During gameplay, players will have access to variety of weapons that are unique and innovative, inspired by modern military equipment.</plot>

		<plot>King of Clubs is an innovative action-puzzle game, combining the challenge of the traditional ball-rolling puzzler with the classic tacky seaside pastime of mini-golf. As an evolution of the ball-rolling puzzle genre, each level has multiple solutions, and as further equipment is unlocked, new paths through each hole become viable. Building on the great tradition of sorry-looking mini-golf courses, the game is set in a dilapidated theme-park which takes decaying kitsch to new extremes.</plot>

		<plot>Lego Star Wars II takes the fun and customization ability of the LEGO play pattern and combines it with the epic story, characters and action from the revolutionary Star Wars: Episodes IV, V and VI. With a unique tongue-in-cheek take on the Original Trilogy, LEGO Star Wars II lets you build and battle your way through your favorite film moments. From Darth Vader's pursuit of Princess Leia aboard her Blockade Runner to Luke's final confrontation with Emperor Palpatine. For the first time ever, characters can get in and out of vehicles, as well as ride creatures. Because it's LEGO style, you can also mix and match the body parts of more than 50 playable characters to create one of millions of possible LEGO Star Wars heroes. And on PS2, Xbox and Windows platforms, a game save from the first LEGO Star Wars can unlock another 50-plus additional characters for Free Play mode -- that's more than 100 total characters. Other exciting additions include free-roaming vehicle levels, the ability to switch ships at will in Free Play mode, cool new character-specific attacks and maneuvers, playable mini-kit vehicles, an adaptive difficulty option and more.</plot>

		<plot>Lara Croft Tomb Raider: Anniversary is a remake of the original Tomb Raider with a technically more advanced graphics engine. It has the same basic storyline, though some cutscenes and much of the dialogue within have been expanded or modified in other ways. Locations correspond to those of the original version and are accessed in the same order, but have been re-designed with different layouts and mostly completely different puzzles which allow implementation of new moves introduced in Lara Croft Tomb Raider: Legend: swinging on ropes and using a grappling hook at specific points.[CR]Puzzles are generally more focused on acrobatics in this version, ledges being much more prominently featured as a level design element, requiring combinations of jumping and shimmying across them to access areas. This type of gameplay replaces the key-retrieval and block-pushing puzzles of the original almost entirely. Combat is similar to that of the first game, though the player must now manually activate targeting. Some boss fights have been made a separate enclosed stage rather than being part of the exploration as in the original version. These fights may have puzzle-solving elements and often require the player to use Lara's new "adrenaline dodge" ability, which slightly slows down time when the opponent charges at her while in an "enraged" state. Some cutscenes require the player to participate in quick-time events.</plot>

		<plot>Legend is the seventh major game in the Tomb Raider series, now for the first time developed by Crystal Dynamics, along with the original character designer of the game's protagonist Lara Croft: Toby Gard.[CR]Heroine Lara is searching for a South American relic, but her adventure takes a different course when rogue anthropologist Amanda Evert shows up. Presumed dead along with a team of graduate students after an accident in a tomb in Peru, where Lara was the only one to escape, Amanda is back with a score to settle as they both race, along with the shady James Rutland Jr., to obtain an ancient artifact. Many other characters, both friends and foes, will stir things up. The story takes Lara through locations all over the world, from the Himalayas to Ghana, Kazakhstan, Bolivia, Japan and England, including her famous mansion filled with secrets and collectibles. Aside from current events, Lara's past is also revealed, through flashbacks. Among other things, you will get to know how she lost her mother and why it is such a burden.[CR]The typical third-person action-adventuring exploring is still present. Lara can move more freely, and is no longer limited by specific jumps. As you travel through rough environments, you will need to run, dive, swim, climb on poles, ladders, roofs, use zip lines, shimmy and vault, with acrobatic actions such as somersaults and flips. You need to cross difficult terrain, solve puzzles to advance or open up new areas, and engage in combat. New tools include a grappling hook, not only used to move around but also to haul enemies Scorpion-style, binoculars, a PLS (personal light source), flares, a PDA and a headset to keep in contact with tech support Zip.[CR]Enemies are still rather scarce. Both humans and animals will attack you, and the game retains the auto lock-on mode, but now with a slide attack and close combat with both kicks and punches, plus bullet-time actions to get behind enemies quickly. Lara carries her trademark dual-wielded pistols, but can also pick up new weapons along the way, such as a shotgun and grenades. Missions take place in both indoor and outdoor environments, with arcade motorcycle and jeep sequences in between. As usual, Lara has a fancy outfit for each location.[CR]The PSP version includes the full game and adds a multiplayer mode: Tomb Trials. You can race another player through tombs to see who comes out first, or go on a timed scavenger hunt for artifacts.</plot>

		<plot>Legend is the seventh major game in the Tomb Raider series, now for the first time developed by Crystal Dynamics, along with the original character designer of the game's protagonist Lara Croft: Toby Gard.[CR]Heroine Lara is searching for a South American relic, but her adventure takes a different course when rogue anthropologist Amanda Evert shows up. Presumed dead along with a team of graduate students after an accident in a tomb in Peru, where Lara was the only one to escape, Amanda is back with a score to settle as they both race, along with the shady James Rutland Jr., to obtain an ancient artifact. Many other characters, both friends and foes, will stir things up. The story takes Lara through locations all over the world, from the Himalayas to Ghana, Kazakhstan, Bolivia, Japan and England, including her famous mansion filled with secrets and collectibles. Aside from current events, Lara's past is also revealed, through flashbacks. Among other things, you will get to know how she lost her mother and why it is such a burden.[CR]The typical third-person action-adventuring exploring is still present. Lara can move more freely, and is no longer limited by specific jumps. As you travel through rough environments, you will need to run, dive, swim, climb on poles, ladders, roofs, use zip lines, shimmy and vault, with acrobatic actions such as somersaults and flips. You need to cross difficult terrain, solve puzzles to advance or open up new areas, and engage in combat. New tools include a grappling hook, not only used to move around but also to haul enemies Scorpion-style, binoculars, a PLS (personal light source), flares, a PDA and a headset to keep in contact with tech support Zip.[CR]Enemies are still rather scarce. Both humans and animals will attack you, and the game retains the auto lock-on mode, but now with a slide attack and close combat with both kicks and punches, plus bullet-time actions to get behind enemies quickly. Lara carries her trademark dual-wielded pistols, but can also pick up new weapons along the way, such as a shotgun and grenades. Missions take place in both indoor and outdoor environments, with arcade motorcycle and jeep sequences in between. As usual, Lara has a fancy outfit for each location.[CR]The PSP version includes the full game and adds a multiplayer mode: Tomb Trials. You can race another player through tombs to see who comes out first, or go on a timed scavenger hunt for artifacts.</plot>

		<plot>Lumines II is the sequel to the extremely addictive puzzle-based video game, Lumines. Gamers control squares made of four smaller block pieces that are dropped into the playing field one at a time to form same-color squares. The vertical "timeline" sweeps across the playing field from left to right and wipes the same-color squares from the playing field. Unmatched blocks pile up, and the game ends when the pile gets to the top of the playing screen. Advance through many action-packed levels, each with its own musical theme and sound effects.</plot>

		<plot>While seemingly placid on the surface, the world of Lunar is slowly descending into chaos, as the Goddess Althena, the creator and guardian of the world, has disappeared and the valiant efforts of the legendary Dragonmaster Dyne and his faithful companions fade into obscurity. With Althena gone and no one able or willing to become the next Dragonmaster, a shadowy figure, known only as the Magic Emperor, has started plotting to usurp Althena's place and become a god. In a remote village far removed from the decay that is slowly spreading throughout the world lives a young man named Alex, who dreams of one day becoming the next Dragonmaster like his hero Dyne. One day, Alex's friend Ramus convinces him to head towards a cave near town, where it is rumored the legendary White Dragon resides. With Alex's adopted sister Luna and his mysterious pet Nall in tow, Alex heads off on what seems to be a meaningless adventure, not knowing that it would be the first step in an epic journey with the fate of the entire world at stake.</plot>

		<plot>One of the first Sony MLB licensed games to be on the PSP, it features all the major league teams at the time as well as the top players for its day with brand new animations designed for the PSP. The game can be considered a slimmed down version of MLB 2006. It has the standard game modes, Quick Game, Season Mode as well as a Multiplayer mode where two players can compete against each other using the Ad Hoc.[CR]Some of the new gameplay mechanics for the game areRelease Point Pitching with Confidence meter which would determine the success rate of the pitcher depending on the stats and skill of the player. The more successful pitches made within a certain zone, the easier the pitches become, missing them cause wild pitches or pitch a line drive right to the batter.[CR]Another is the Playmaker Fielding Marker, where unlike other games this one used the players stats to determine if regular plays like pop-ups would be considered easy by giving the player ample opportunity by showing the landing location faster and giving it a more wider area. Less skilled players would be given less of a warning and a smaller catching radius, making even the simplest plays more challenging.[CR]The Branch Point Technology introduced a seamless flow of transition for the game that allowed the player to plan out the direction of a throw while still in the process of catching it and was also used for baserunning that gave it a smoother feel to running and sliding.</plot>

		<plot>In MLB 06: The Show you can manage players, their salaries, keep up to date with the business of the team, check on the players team morale and keep them happy to keep your team in contention. Control everything of your business even to the prices of the tickets to even the prices of the vendors.[CR]It has a career mode where you can create yourself by using the game controls or by using EyeToy to paste your face on. You can keep tabs on yourself in career mode as and control which teams you want play for, but you have to earn you right to compete in the big leagues by battling your way up from the minor leagues. Keep track of your achievements as you progress and if you choose, you can even skip parts of the game to your at bats or pitching appearances, making the game much more streamlined and very personal.[CR]The players act very realistic due to the fact they used motion capturing for almost every major player, giving it untolds amounts of realistic animation and almost giving them real emotions, such as if a pitcher gives up a big home run, you can see the disappointed on his face or if you hit a game winning home run your entire team goes nuts celebrating.[CR]The game also comes with a fun set of mini games including the classic Home Run Derby and a new King of the Diamond, which has multiple levels, a timer and is constantly adapting to keep you guessing. The rosters even were up to date at the time, actually having the 2006 rosters instead of the previous year.</plot>

		<plot>Sony's baseball franchise returns for 2007 with updated rosters and classic features, such as season mode, managerial mode along with the classic career mode, but also has some new features as well.[CR]One of the new features is the Road to the Show, a new take on the career mode that expands last years version. Instead of playing every player on the team, the game focuses more on the player alone. It will fast forward to decisions tied to the player (i.e. fielding a ball hit towards your player or batting), but also gives you goals to complete (i.e. knocking in a run or getting on base or trying for a double play while fielding). Success of these goals will help you establish your place with the manager and team and give you a better chance for a major league start.[CR]It also features an Adaptive Pitching Intelligence, where the game learns more from your at bats or your pitching, but also has your catchers help you out more by picking signals out instead of just randomly selecting pitches. Another is umpire personality, where the strike zone is smaller or larger, depending upon the umpire calling the game at the time.[CR]The all-new New Pitch Command System (PCS) delivers comprehensive strategy to pitch selection, as a pitcher's "pitch comfort" will be predetermined based on a best to worst pitch scenario, letting you decide whether to stick with what is working or begin a new pitching regiment.[CR]PS2 and PS3 versions provide online league play, which also lets you check on real-time MLB scores and news while the PSP version also lets you play against others using Wi-Fi connection.[CR]It features an extensive MLB license, with most of the players with a few exceptions and also features Rex Hudler, Matt Vasgersian and Dave Campbell as color commentators, providing realistic coverage, almost giving it a TV feel along with realistic graphics, giving the players and the action a very realistic feel, such as a pitchers let down after giving up a huge homerun or a team rushing the field to celebrate after hitting a homerun, winning the game.</plot>

		<plot>MLB 09: The Show is the 2009 edition in the MLB baseball series. The game keeps the original gameplay intact, but improves over predecessors by revising and adding features, and upgrading the graphics. Road to the Show 3.0 has been updated with an all-new steal and lead-off system and also adds more interaction with the player's coaches. There are also several new features on Franchise 2.0 which include salary arbitration, waiver transactions, September call-ups, and a 40-man roster for the player's franchise. This edition introduces online season leagues, with full drafts and schedules to play ahead in the season.</plot>

		<plot>Sony's highly rated The Show baseball series returns with this 2010 edition. The realistic baseball simulator includes a bunch of new features and improves on many of the faults of the '09 version including online gameplay. Note that the PSP version of this game only features ad-hoc online compatibility.[CR]For the first time in the series, MLB 10: The Show lets you experience baseball through the eyes of the guy in the catcher mask. The all new Catcher mode allows you to call pitches from the backstop and control the game just like Minnesota Twins catcher Joe Mauer, the cover athlete for this edition. Homerun Derby also makes a return to the series as both a standalone mode and as an experience during the All-Star Break. Not to be forgotten is the Movie Maker mode which allows you to combine saved replays of a game to turn into a highlight reel and save to your hard drive, and also the updated Road to the Show 4.0 with new settings and stat features.</plot>

		<plot>Marvel: Ultimate Alliance is an action/RPG that features the largest roster of comic book characters ever seen in a video game. Players assume the roles of more than 20 Marvel Super Heroes including Spider-Man, Wolverine, Blade and Captain America, and through their actions determine the fate of both planet Earth and the Marvel universe - revealed in one of multiple epilogues. Marvel: Ultimate Alliance offers total team customization, where players create their own team name, icon and vehicle, as well as establish their team reputation as they play throughout the story. Gamers also have the option to level up each character individually to their liking, or all team members at the same time to keep their heroes balanced. With the game's new combat system, players battle against the world's most notorious Marvel Super Villains in the air, underwater, and on the ground, using grappling, blocking and dodging moves, by charging up their Super Hero powers before unleashing them, and using environmental objects as one and two-handed weapons. Marvel: Ultimate Alliance features a storyline where the missions players accept, the objectives they complete, and their interactions with other characters throughout the game directly impact how the story plays out. The game also features a robust multiplayer component where fans can band together with friends as their favorite Marvel Super Heroes, and fight evil in both on and offline cooperative story modes. There's also a Competitive Mode where the game tracks various in-game stats so players can see how well they stack up against one another - affecting the amount of experience points earned and how equipment is distributed.</plot>

Using character-specific super powers and customized combo attacks, players will blast, punch, and bash in fast-moving combat with their nemesis. Players can either jump into a battle arena against up to three opponents in Battle Mode, or choose to relive six campaigns as depicted from the animated series in Adventure Mode. Marvel Super Hero Squad is an immersive, single and multiplayer game filled with dramatic, interactive environments where players are given extraordinary powers to fight for good or evil, depending on which Super Hero Squad character they chose to play as.</plot>

		<plot>Set in the ever popular Marvel Universe, the Super Hero Squad is on a dire mission against Dr. Doom-s Lethal Legion of villains to recover the hidden Infinity Fractals; fragments of the all-powerful Infinity Sword. Each Infinity Fractal holds incredible power and can have significant effects on its possessor, giving each character special abilities that could alter the game-s rules and playing field. With more than 20 Marvel characters to mix and match, players can choose to take on the role of their favorite Super Heroes and Super Villains, such as Captain America, Dr. Doom, Falcon, Hulk, Iron Man, Juggernaut, Ms. Marvel, Silver Surfer, Thing, Thor and Wolverine, to name a few. Using character-specific super powers and customized combo attacks, players will blast, punch, and bash in fast-moving combat with their nemesis. Players can either jump into a battle arena against up to three opponents in Battle Mode, or choose to relive six campaigns as depicted from the animated series in Adventure Mode. Marvel Super Hero Squad is an immersive, single and multiplayer game filled with dramatic, interactive environments where players are given extraordinary powers to fight for good or evil, depending on which Super Hero Squad character they chose to play as.</plot>

		<plot>In the sequel to the PSP-exclusive Medal of Honor: Heroes, players take the role of OSS Operative John Berg during the Normandy campaign of June 1944 in eight missions. He needs to get behind enemy lines and prevent Hitler from deploying the V2 rocket, with the help of US troopers. The story is told through briefings with still voices and narrated voice-overs.[CR]Next to the classic first-person shooting gameplay true to the series, the Wii version offers a new, more accessible mode with on-rails shooting - the computer handles the movement while players only need to aim and shoot. In the regular mode, players move around with the analog stick, look around with the Wii remote, lean with the Nunchuk and fire with the B-button, a departure from the control system introduced in Medal of Honor: Vanguard. The game also offers a lock-on system with the Z-button. Alternately, players can use the Wii Zapper to aim and shoot.[CR]The regular combat remains, but much more events have been added with a few mini-games thrown in. For instance, players need to twist the Wii remote to tune a radio for mid-game incoming information and the sound comes through the remote's speaker. Other quirks require the player to raise the Nunchuk to pump the shotgun. Players need to plant charges (twist the Wii remote like a timer), pick up documents and man various stationary guns. This version also marks the return of the sniper rifle and adds bazookas and mortars.[CR]Up to 32 players can simultaneously join a single match, with game modes such as Death Match, Team Death Match and Infiltration. Multiplayer maps are adaptations of the single-player levels.</plot>

Other quirks require the player to raise the Nunchuk to pump the shotgun. Players need to plant charges (twist the Wii remote like a timer), pick up documents and man various stationary guns. This version also marks the return of the sniper rifle and adds bazookas and mortars.[CR]Up to 32 players can simultaneously join a single match, with game modes such as Death Match, Team Death Match and Infiltration.

		<plot>MediEvil: Resurrection is an enhanced and altered version of MediEvil. While the overall storyline remains the same, the design of some characters and locations has been changed to have a slightly more comical edge.

A few plot-related sections that were not present in the original release appear in this version, e.g. a sub-plot involving the Anubis Stone. Voice acting has been added.

		<plot>The year is 2016. An airplane is hijacked by unknown terrorists. On the board of the plane is senator Hach, an important US politician, who might be the next president of the country. In exchange for the senator, the terrorist want something from the US government. You don't know what that something is, but it goes under the code name "Pythagoras". Since handing it over to the terrorist is not what the government is planning to do, it sends you, the famous special agent Solid Snake, to rescue the senator and to find out who is really behind the hijacking.[CR]"Metal Gear Acid" is set in the familiar Metal Gear universe and graphically resembles the PS2 titles of the series, but its gameplay is quite different from that of the other games. "Metal Gear Acid" combines the traditional stealth gameplay with strategy. It is a turn-based game in which you plan your turns by selecting playing cards that are available in your card deck. Each card represents an action: attacking, moving, etc. You must plan your actions carefully to stay unnoticed and also plan ahead which cards you'd want to keep during the next round, and which you are ready to sacrifice in order to make an efficient move immediately.</plot>

		<plot>What happened after the first Metal Gear Ac!d is somewhat left for open discussion as Snake is suffering from some serious amnesia right from the game start. He doesn't know much about his past, but is well aware of his skills, as are his newly acquired companions. Returning back to the US from a mission well done, his only hope is that he'll start remembering his past as he steps on a friendly soil. But instead of having some time to do so, an FBI agent takes him and his friends into custody, leaving him with only one option to save his friends, and that is to help the agent with a mission of his own. Reluctant but left with little to ponder about, Snake agrees until he can connect some dots.[CR]Unlike the prior game, the game uses a 3D cell-shading technique making the game less realistic but more colorful, now spanning over 500 cards at your disposal. Gameplay is basically the same turn-based style as the original, though comes with certain enhancements like being able to undo your moves to a certain degree, or moving in real-time and not losing moves on opening doors or crouching. There is also a new type of cards that is self-triggered when you use other cards, usually enhancing your action in one way or another.[CR]The Metal Gear Ac!d 2 package comes with a Solid Eye, a special type of 3D glasses (a cardboard box that slides over the PSP, not the blue-purple plastic but with lenses) to play the game with a 3D effect. You can also use it to watch various Snake Eater and other movies as you unlock them in the game, giving you the feeling of 3D space.</plot>

		<plot>After the events of the third Metal Gear Solid game, Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, Naked Snake isolates himself from the United States and sets up home in Colombia. Here, he creates Militaires Sans Frontières (Soldiers without Borders), a private military group that provides support for countries in need. Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker's story will explain the events which lead to Militaires Sans Frontières becoming Outer Heaven in later games and also see him finally accepting his role as Big Boss. Snake is still struggling with the guilt over the murder of a person who was very close to him.[CR]One day, Snake is introduced to Ramón Gálvez, a peace teacher, and his student, Paz Ortega. The two want to ask for Militaires Sans Frontières hand in helping the country of Costa Rica. Recently, an unknown armed force with high-tech weapons has been creating trouble around the country and because Costa Rica's constitution forbids a military army there's nothing anybody can do about it. Snake at first refuses to help, believing that it may cause more tension in Latin America, which many believe is the centerpiece of maintaining power in the East and West. But after being presented a tape recorder by Gálvez which accidentally recorded a conversation between two women, Snake agrees, believing that one of the voices on the tape belongs to The Boss herself. Snake then sets out on a journey, a journey to not only bring peace back to the land of Costa Rica, but also bring peace upon himself.[CR]Peace Walker is set between the events of Snake Eater and the original Metal Gear. Snake is controlled via the analog stick and the rest of the buttons vary depending on the type of button configuration you choose; shooter type, action type, or hunter type. Gameplay consists of that usually seen in the Metal Gear series, which is stealth-base movement. That doesn't mean you always have to be stealthy though, if you want you can just let go and shoot up your enemies with different weapons ranging from the M16A1 to a Stun Rod. Cutscenes are presented in an artistic comic book style similar to that of Portable Ops, with some being interactive.[CR]Near the start of the game you will be given a central mother base to use for a number of different things. It is here where you can save your game, develop weapons, and embark on quests. At the Mission Selector screen you can replay previous missions to gain a higher score and also participate in extra ones not necessary to the main story. Cutscenes in which you have watched throughout the main campaign can be seen once again. Developing and upgrading weapons is done by spending currency known as GMP in which you obtain doing quests. At Mother Base you will be able to assign your MSF staff into different teams depending on their abilities and skills. Putting the right people in the right place will open up more opportunities to develop more items and weapons.[CR]Multiplayer in the game is limited to ad-hoc mode and co-op. All story missions can be played with up to two people and the other co-op missions with four people. After completing certain missions and meeting certain requirements, Snake will be able to head to an island where you and some friends can engage in hunts against monsters from Capcom's Monster Hunter series.</plot>

		<plot>After the events of the third Metal Gear Solid game, Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, Naked Snake isolates himself from the United States and sets up home in Colombia. Here, he creates Militaires Sans Frontières (Soldiers without Borders), a private military group that provides support for countries in need. Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker's story will explain the events which lead to Militaires Sans Frontières becoming Outer Heaven in later games and also see him finally accepting his role as Big Boss. Snake is still struggling with the guilt over the murder of a person who was very close to him.[CR]One day, Snake is introduced to Ramón Gálvez, a peace teacher, and his student, Paz Ortega. The two want to ask for Militaires Sans Frontières hand in helping the country of Costa Rica. Recently, an unknown armed force with high-tech weapons has been creating trouble around the country and because Costa Rica's constitution forbids a military army there's nothing anybody can do about it. Snake at first refuses to help, believing that it may cause more tension in Latin America, which many believe is the centerpiece of maintaining power in the East and West. But after being presented a tape recorder by Gálvez which accidentally recorded a conversation between two women, Snake agrees, believing that one of the voices on the tape belongs to The Boss herself. Snake then sets out on a journey, a journey to not only bring peace back to the land of Costa Rica, but also bring peace upon himself.[CR]Peace Walker is set between the events of Snake Eater and the original Metal Gear. Snake is controlled via the analog stick and the rest of the buttons vary depending on the type of button configuration you choose; shooter type, action type, or hunter type. Gameplay consists of that usually seen in the Metal Gear series, which is stealth-base movement. That doesn't mean you always have to be stealthy though, if you want you can just let go and shoot up your enemies with different weapons ranging from the M16A1 to a Stun Rod. Cutscenes are presented in an artistic comic book style similar to that of Portable Ops, with some being interactive.[CR]Near the start of the game you will be given a central mother base to use for a number of different things. It is here where you can save your game, develop weapons, and embark on quests. At the Mission Selector screen you can replay previous missions to gain a higher score and also participate in extra ones not necessary to the main story. Cutscenes in which you have watched throughout the main campaign can be seen once again. Developing and upgrading weapons is done by spending currency known as GMP in which you obtain doing quests. At Mother Base you will be able to assign your MSF staff into different teams depending on their abilities and skills. Putting the right people in the right place will open up more opportunities to develop more items and weapons.[CR]Multiplayer in the game is limited to ad-hoc mode and co-op. All story missions can be played with up to two people and the other co-op missions with four people. After completing certain missions and meeting certain requirements, Snake will be able to head to an island where you and some friends can engage in hunts against monsters from Capcom's Monster Hunter series.</plot>

		<plot>Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops is the first real Metal Gear game on the PSP, unlike the two preceding Metal Gear Ac!d games with turn-based strategy gameplay.[CR]It's been six years since the events in Snake Eater. Snake has been captured and imprisoned in an abandoned missile silo in Colombia, and with no support this time. At least, not at first. With the help of a fellow prisoner, Snake escapes and the game truly begins.[CR]Portable Ops is a classic Metal Gear game in almost every sense. The controls will be familiar to anyone who has played previous console entries in the series. Snake can peek around corners, sneak up behind guards... they even carried over CQC (Close Quarters Combat) from Snake Eater.[CR]What really sets Portable Ops apart (aside from being on the PSP) is the pacing, and a few changes to the gameplay mechanics. The game is played out in missions, which are specific to certain areas. Most of the areas are not that large, which sometimes means seeing "Mission Complete" in only a matter of minutes. The ability to play through the game in segments really lends itself to the handheld format. If you only have five minutes, choose a quick mission, knock it out, save and you are done. Being able to return to each area whenever you want to procure more supplies means that even once you finish your mission, you will be coming back.[CR]Gathering supplies is also essential due to the main new mechanic found in Portable Ops: recruiting. While Snake starts out on his own, he can enlist disgruntled guards, frustrated technicians, stubborn doctors and more. These soldiers can be used in your "Sneaking Unit" (the team you take into battle for each mission), or in one of the many support units, with certain soldiers having a more natural talent for certain areas. If you put someone who has medical bonuses in your Medical unit, they can produce rations, help your troops recover faster between missions and more. Technicians can create new items for your team, and Spies can steal ammo and give you intel on specific maps, which can open up new side missions or allow you to grab some heavy weaponry.[CR]Missions themselves range from recon to rescue to demolitions and beyond. You can only take four troops into a mission, and usually one of them has to be Snake. However, you don't have to always use Snake during the mission, he just has to be present. You can only control one character at a time, while the rest of the team hides safely inside boxes (usually right by the entry point). On the field, the soldier you use can make a big difference. Many times you can totally bypass a building's defenses just by playing as a guard. If you do not do anything to draw attention to yourself, you can oftentimes walk right past the enemy, plant some TNT, and walk away.[CR]Several soldiers even have special abilities that come in handy during a mission, such as being able to transfer extra items you pick up directly to your truck (each character is limited to four inventory slots), or drag unconscious enemies twice as fast.[CR]The game supports multiplayer for up to six player simultaneously, over WiFi Ad Hoc and Infrastructure, with game modes such as Team Death Match, Death Match and Capture Mission.</plot>

		<plot>Metal Slug is a run and gun video game developed and originally released by Nazca Corporation and later published by SNK. It was originally released in 1996 for the Neo Geo MVS arcade platform. The game is widely known for its sense of humor, fluid hand-drawn animation, and fast-paced two-player action.[CR]The player(s) must shoot constantly at a continual stream of enemies in order to reach the end of each level. At this point, the player confronts a boss, who is usually considerably larger and tougher than regular enemies. On the way through each level, the player can find numerous weapon upgrades and "Metal Slug" tanks. The tank is known as the SV-001 ("SV" stands for Super Vehicle), which not only increases the player's offense, but considerably adds to their defense.[CR]In addition to shooting, the player can also perform melee attacks by using a knife. The player does not die simply by coming into contact with enemies, and correspondingly, many of the enemy troops also have melee attacks. Much of the game's scenery is also destructible, and occasionally, this reveals extra items or power-ups, although most of the time it simply results in collateral damage.[CR]During the course of a level, the player also encounters POWs, who, if freed, offer the player bonuses in the form of random items or weapons. At the end of each level, the player receives a scoring bonus based on the number of freed POWs. If the player dies before the end of the level, the tally of freed POWs reverts to zero.[CR]There are a total of six levels, in locations such as forests, garrisoned cities, snowy mountain valleys, canyons, and military bases. The vast majority of enemies are soldiers equipped with weaponry befitting their specific role. There are also several mechanized enemies, such as tanks, mobile artillery, aircraft, armored personnel carriers and technicals. Much of the game's humor comes from how the enemies are depicted; the player often encounters them as they are sunbathing, roasting food over a fire, or simply conversing amongst themselves. They also tend to scream loudly if they see the player, and often try to either run away or fight back.[CR]The American version changed the color of the soldiers' blood from red to white.</plot>

Players can also cooperate in Ad-Hoc while gunning down hordes of humorous foes using familiar weapons in seven distinct levels that will see our heroes traverse deserts, mountains, caves and lava pits to finally put an end to their longtime enemy.[CR]This revised version includes additional content including co-op multiplayer and downloadable content, as well as the character Leona Heidern.</plot>

		<plot>In Mimana Iyar Chronicle, players are cast into the role of Crais Sewell, an anti-social, drunk, unemployed swordsman. As he loses his last cents and gets into a huge debt with the Mercenaries' Guild, he's offered a chance to repay his debt, by offering his services as bodyguard to a little girl known as Sophie, who wants to find seven gems scattered around the world. Walk into a few dungeons, break a few pots, whack a few gelatinous cubes, find the gems, how hard can it be?[CR]While the main exploring part of the game takes place in an isometric view, the random encounters the party will face take place in a side-scrolling panel. While the player controls Crais directly, in real-time, the other party member's behavior can be adjusted through menus. Stringing combos together can make Crais go into Just Attack mode, where every attack causes critical damage.</plot>

These weapons can be picked up by item pods scattered throughout the track and each weapon has three levels which starts out at level one and will upgrade for each item pod picked up. After the initial race, the player will be directed to the ModSpot, the central hub for MNR for players to get together.[CR]At the ModSpot the player is introduced to the creation aspect of the game, using the creation station the player can modify their racers and karts. The player can unlock more items through the career mode by winning matches and completing certain challenges such as taking down three opponents, activate three traps, etc. They can also pick up tokens scattered on each track (five tokens for each track in total) and using them at a vending machine and like a slot machine, picking either 1 token, 2 tokens or 5 tokens and randomly getting an item depending upon the tokens used.[CR]Players can also create their own tracks using various tools to sculpt the landscape to their liking and create their ultimate dream track. The players can share their creations with the world by publishing them, using a share center they can upload their created racers, karts and tracks and likewise download other players creations as well. Also at the ModSpot the player can view the Top Mod and Top Karts of the week, see who is in the current room, view to players of the week, enter the creation studios and even set up races with friends on official tracks or custom tracks by players.</plot>

		<plot>Monster Hunter Freedom is a port of the Japan-only Monster Hunter G, a sort of follow-up to the original Monster Hunter - more of a director's cut of the game. While a good deal of the game mirrors the Playstation 2 original, there have been a large number of additions. There are now more quests, more monsters, more weapons, more armor and more areas around town to use to your advantage.[CR]You now have a farm that sits just outside of town. You'll have access to some mining veins, bug catching spots, a dock for catching fish and a garden. This means that now you can gather materials when you're between missions, which doesn't eliminate the need to gather things while on the hunt, but it does make it less of a hassle. Another extra area is the training school. Here you can partake in hunts with specific limitations; you have a specified item and equipment layout, and have to take on larger prey within a shorter time limit. It's tough to be sure, but it also opens up the ability to produce some very special and powerful new weapons.[CR]There are some insanely difficult hunts you can take later in the game. As for the new creatures, they run the gamut from having added colors (with new armor options to match) to totally new monsters (like a battle-worn wyvern with a huge mean streak). As an added bonus, not only can you make new types of armor from these new critters, but you can (in some cases) make more armor from classic monsters.[CR]The controls on the PSP are a little different. While the PSP does lack two shoulder buttons and a second analog stick, players just press two face buttons instead of swinging the right analog stick. Triangle, Circle, and Triangle and Circle combined unleash three different types of attacks, while holding the right shoulder button blocks (or charges to attack if you're using a hammer). Multiplayer is limited to Ad-Hoc, so no going online to form a hunting party.</plot>

Forgoing the character interaction and inventory-based puzzles found in earlier computer adventure games, Myst places you in a lonely, desolate environment with no obvious indication on where you should go or what you are supposed to do. By exploring the island, you will eventually stumble upon an assortment of puzzles in the form of intricate contraptions, whose secrets can only be unlocked after discovering evidence of their nature. As you progress in the game, you will find four other books written by Atrus that magically transport you to additional worlds, each offering more interconnected puzzles and clues to the storyline. Myst's look is noteworthy for featuring still images viewed from a first-person perspective, with interaction limited to manipulating a cursor over each static picture.</plot>

		<plot>Need for Speed Undercover has players racing through speedways, dodging cops and chasing rivals as they go deep undercover to take down an International crime syndicate. The game heralds the return of high-intensity police chases and introduces the all-new 'Heroic Driving Engine' -- a unique technology that generates incredible high-performance moves at 180 miles per hour during breathtaking highway battles. A mix of computer graphics and live-action movies immerses gamers in the rich world of the Tri-City Bay Area. The city's open-world environment features over 80 miles of roads, including an enormous highway system that sets the stage for highway battles. These high-speed, high-stake chase sequences push players to the limit as they fight off cops and opponents while whipping through traffic at 180 miles per hour. An intelligent new A.I. mechanic delivers a realistic and high-energy action driving experience. Going back to the franchise's roots, Need for Speed Undercover features more aggressive and intelligent cops whose sole purpose is to take down the player quickly and by any means necessary. Need for Speed Undercover also features the series' signature car customization, real-world damage and realistic driving physics. The game includes some of the hottest licensed cars such as the Audi R8, BMW M6 and Lexus IS-F.</plot>

		<plot>Need for Speed Undercover has players racing through speedways, dodging cops and chasing rivals as they go deep undercover to take down an International crime syndicate. The game heralds the return of high-intensity police chases and introduces the all-new 'Heroic Driving Engine' -- a unique technology that generates incredible high-performance moves at 180 miles per hour during breathtaking highway battles. A mix of computer graphics and live-action movies immerses gamers in the rich world of the Tri-City Bay Area. The city's open-world environment features over 80 miles of roads, including an enormous highway system that sets the stage for highway battles. These high-speed, high-stake chase sequences push players to the limit as they fight off cops and opponents while whipping through traffic at 180 miles per hour. An intelligent new A.I. mechanic delivers a realistic and high-energy action driving experience. Going back to the franchise's roots, Need for Speed Undercover features more aggressive and intelligent cops whose sole purpose is to take down the player quickly and by any means necessary. Need for Speed Undercover also features the series' signature car customization, real-world damage and realistic driving physics. The game includes some of the hottest licensed cars such as the Audi R8, BMW M6 and Lexus IS-F.</plot>

		<rom name="redump.psp.p2/Nickelodeon Avatar - The Last Airbender (USA).zip" size="129595225"/>
		<plot>Based on the animated television program of the same name, Avatar: The Last Airbender follows the adventures of a group of kids living in an Asian-inspired fantasy world where the nations have been divided up according to the four classical elements: Air, Water, Earth, and Fire. Within each nation are people who can control that one element, known as benders. The Avatar is a person who can control all four elements, and is charged with keeping peace between the four nations. However, 100 years previous the Avatar had disappeared, making it possible for the Fire Nation to wage a war of conquest across the world. As the show begins, the new Avatar, Aang (originally an Airbender, hence the title of the series), has been found, and now he must travel the world, learning how to bend all four elements and fighting against the Fire Nation alongside his friends Katara (a Waterbender of the Water Tribe) and Sokka (her older brother).[CR]In the game, the player may choose one of four characters: Aang, Katara, Sokka, and Haru (an Earthbender). Each character's fighting style and abilities are unique, and new abilities can be gained as they earn experience by defeating enemies. Items are also available to assist the player, such as armor, chi, accessories, and healing potions. As an action/adventure game, the gameplay is viewed from top-down perspective, with the player battling enemies and searching for specific items required the complete the quests necessary to progress further into the game. The story unfolds over several chapters, and players cannot return to previous areas.[CR]Set between the first and second seasons of the show, the game follows Aang and friends as they investigate the disappearance of a young Waterbender, and find themselves in pursuit of an inventor named Lian the Maker, who has been forced to create dangerous machines for the Fire Nation. As they travel between the Water Tribe and Earth Kingdom, the characters battle Fire Nation soldiers, strange animals, and various machines. Some other characters from the world of Avatar also make minor appearances in the game, including Prince Zuko, who appears during cut scenes only.</plot>

		<plot>Team up with a cast of crazy critters, unleashing your animal instincts in Open Season, the game - a riotous romp in the great outdoors in which a rowdy brood of forest animals turns the tables on a bunch of unsuspecting hunters. When a domesticated grizzly named Boog gets lured into leaving the creature comforts of home by a fast-talking mule deer named Elliott, he finds himself lost in the woods just three days before hunting season begins. Forced to "rough it" in the great outdoors, Boog goes native, rallying all the forest animals to take back their home and send the hunters packing. Interact with Beth, Shaw, and all your animal favorites from the Open Season film. Throw skunk bombs, hurl rabbits, use acorn-firing squirrels, and pull outrageous woodland pranks to scare the pants off the hunters. Roll in a giant snowball, ride the rapids on a floating outhouse, zip through tunnels in a crazy mine cart ride, and take on more madcap adventures as Boog discovers how to go from "Mild" to "Wild". Challenge your friends or team up together in 4-player mini-games.</plot>

Defenders react better to danger, closing down the ball and charging at shots and the goalkeepers hold shots that are closer to them as well.

The terms "PES" and "Winning Eleven" have always been synonymous with realism and superior gameplay, but this year PES will further narrow the gap between the game, and the real thing! New stadiums, players motions and gameplay modes will bolster a game already focused on providing an exciting soccer experience. In 2009, Pro Evolution will once again push the limits of soccer gaming. If it were any more real, you'd be on the field!</plot>

		<plot>Pro Evolution Soccer is back for 2009! The terms "PES" and "Winning Eleven" have always been synonymous with realism and superior gameplay, but this year PES will further narrow the gap between the game, and the real thing! New stadiums, players motions and gameplay modes will bolster a game already focused on providing an exciting soccer experience. In 2009, Pro Evolution will once again push the limits of soccer gaming. If it were any more real, you'd be on the field!</plot>

		<plot>The Pro Evolution Soccer franchise has long been regarded as offering incredible realism and control, however Pro Evolution Soccer 2011 will reinvigorate the series with the most advanced set of improved gameplay additions, control options and to catch up with the evolution of the real-life soccer. Central to its total freedom of play, Pro Evolution Soccer 2011 introduces a power bar for each player that allows the user to determine the exact strength and placement of every pass and shot. Balls can now be spread absolutely anywhere with surgical precision, with long balls into space, short passes to feet, and intricate one-twos allowing the player to dictate play and control the tempo of a match.</plot>

		<plot>Pro Evolution Soccer 2014 centers everything on the ball including how it moves and how players use it. First touch and sublime control are what set certain players apart from others. The ability to not only read a pass, but to be one step ahead and to know what is needed to gain yards on an encroaching defender. Trueball Tech allows the player to trap or knock on a pass using the analogue stick with detailed bar-centric physics determining the weight shift of the player and the height and speed of the pass, as to how the player's body will automatically shape to receive it. The Pro Evolution Soccer series has long since treated the ball as an individual entity, allowing the player huge amounts of freedom to pass into space, run on to a knocked-on counter, or produces short triangular passes to make space. Trueball Tech adds even more freedom, with full 360-degree control within several yards around the player and the ability to shield the ball from opposing players, use deft controls to wrong-foot them, and intuitive methods to master close control.</plot>

		<plot>PQ2 helps players calculate their intelligence by using the PQ scoring system based on the number of moves and the speed with which they complete more than 250 puzzles. PQ2 players use the PSP system's infrastructure mode to take their score online to measure their brain power against their friends, their country and even their gender. PQ2 uses a measuring system that was created under the guidance of Professor Masuo Koyasu of Kyoto University in Japan that determines players' "Practical Intelligence Quotient" or PQ. Players create their own puzzles and share with friends utilizing the PSP system's gamesharing mode or utilize infrastructure mode to upload puzzles and download new ones. PQ2 allows players the flexibility to choose which puzzles they want to play first and the ability to get a preliminary PQ score in roughly 10 minutes or play through the full puzzle set, including 10 unlockable puzzles, for their full PQ score.</plot>

		<plot>The Godfather: The Game1​2​ (en español, literalmente, El padrino: El juego) es un videojuego basado en la película El padrino del año 1972 y que fue lanzado a la venta en el 2006. Esta no es la primera adaptación de la película a un videojuego, ya que en el año 1991 fue editada una versión para PC en formato bidimensional titulada Godfather.3​[CR]El juego destaca porque muchos de los actores del filme prestaron sus voces, incluyendo a Marlon Brando como Don Vito Corleone, James Caan como Sonny Corleone, Robert Duvall como Tom Hagen y Abe Vigoda como Salvatore Tessio, siendo la ausencia más notable la de Al Pacino.4​ Además, Mark Winegardner, autor de la novela The Godfather Returns, colaboró con la edición de la historia y creando el mundo ficticio de El padrino.5​[CR]Electronic Arts (EA), la compañía que desarrolló el videojuego, anunció en el 2005 que este incorporaría un meticuloso programa llamado MobFace, el cual permite a los jugadores la posibilidad de crear sus propios mafiosos, modificando sus características, rasgos físicos y vestuario. A diferencia de lo que suele ser habitual, el juego no es del tipo tradicional de cumplir misiones, sino más abierto, con un escenario que es un enorme Nueva York estilo años 1940, y sin estilo de juego lineal, como popularizaron los juegos de la franquicia Grand Theft Auto. También se creó el sistema de control Black Hand («Mano Negra») para la manera de presionar y extorsionar a los propietarios de negocios. Usando los controles analógicos, el jugador tiene una amplia gama de métodos para lograr sus objetivos, incluyendo golpear, patear, cabecear, estrangular, etc. EA ha lanzado versiones separadas para la Wii de Nintendo titulada The Godfather: Blackhand Edition y para el PlayStation 3 The Godfather: The Don's Edition, que incluye el Corleone Expansion Pack.6​7​</plot>

		<plot>Pinball Hall of Fame: The Williams Collection faithfully recreates eight of the most memorable tables from the golden age of pinball in photorealistic 3D. Working closely with Williams to ensure authenticity of each of the games, the collection is highlighted by some of the most popular and innovative Williams pinball tables, including Gorgar, the first-ever talking pinball machine, Black Knight, which introduced "Magna-Save" and Bonus Ball, and Space Shuttle, which took the pinball industry by storm in 1984. Every table has been meticulously recreated to bring players the visuals, sound effects and gameplay that made these games legendary successes. Pinball Hall of Fame: The Williams Collection harkens back to the arcades of the 1980s. Players begin Pinball Hall of Fame: The Williams Collection with access to four pinball tables, and the remaining four tables are unlocked as the game progresses. Players can spend as little as two minutes on a quick pinball challenge, or delve deeper into the game, gaining rewards in a token-based system as they unlock each of the pinball tables. Single-player Arcade and Challenge modes provide hours of solo entertainment, and a Multiplayer mode lets players face each other head-on.</plot>

		<plot>PixelJunk Monsters Deluxe is a tower defense strategy game. This PSP version, later also made compatible with the PS Vita, is the first version of the game for the platform and contains the original PS3 game PixelJunk Monsters (Tiki Island) slip-streamed with the DLC PixelJunk Monsters Encore (Toki Island and Tum Tum Tum Island). This version also contains an entirely new location called Gati Gati Island with eleven additional levels, bringing the total amount of levels to 47. It also features two new towers such as a one that upgrades other towers automatically, a new enemy, and a new boss, as well as additional features such as music and concept art galleries that are accessed from the Tiki Hut in the main menu.[CR]Also entirely new for the series is the Challenge mode. Additional challenges are offered for the missions to earn a medal and unlock bonus items. Objectives include beating stages without using certain towers or upgrades, or finishing levels with a certain amount of gems remaining. A two-player co-op mode is available through the PSP's Ad-Hoc mode, or online.</plot>

		<plot>An evil magician crashes a teenagers' party, uses his powers to load all their cars on his trailer and transform them into miniature cars themselves. The friends Hannah, Claire, Vicky, Roger and Mitch need to free themselves by racing pocket cars on tracks, where winning races is awarded with soul gems and soul shards that can return them to their human form.[CR]Races are grouped together in different soul challenges with identical gameplay but different settings such as a garden or a bathroom. Since the cars are very small, the roads are loaded with huge items such as bottles and everyday appliances. The tracks have short-cuts, jumps and slopes, as well power-ups that destroy the environment, provide rockets or freeze the opponent's car. There are four camera perspectives (all third-person) and a button to reset the car when straying away from the track.[CR]Next to the soul races there are time trial and practice modes. The car park has many vehicle models with different statistics, liveries and decals. Most of these still need to be unlocked at the start of the game. Aside from single-player games, there are online play modes with game modes as race, soccer, and domination.</plot>

		<plot>An evil magician crashes a teenagers' party, uses his powers to load all their cars on his trailer and transform them into miniature cars themselves. The friends Hannah, Claire, Vicky, Roger and Mitch need to free themselves by racing pocket cars on tracks, where winning races is awarded with soul gems and soul shards that can return them to their human form.[CR]Races are grouped together in different soul challenges with identical gameplay but different settings such as a garden or a bathroom. Since the cars are very small, the roads are loaded with huge items such as bottles and everyday appliances. The tracks have short-cuts, jumps and slopes, as well power-ups that destroy the environment, provide rockets or freeze the opponent's car. There are four camera perspectives (all third-person) and a button to reset the car when straying away from the track.[CR]Next to the soul races there are time trial and practice modes. The car park has many vehicle models with different statistics, liveries and decals. Most of these still need to be unlocked at the start of the game. Aside from single-player games, there are online play modes with game modes as race, soccer, and domination.</plot>

		<plot>After many dangerous adventures, the Prince finally makes his way home to Babylon, bringing with him his new bride Kaileena, the Empress of Time. Their hopes for a peaceful and happy future together are dashed, however, when they arrive in Persia to find the land ravaged by war. Kaileena is promptly captured and murdered by the evil Vizier, and her death unleashes the Sands of Time, from which the Vizier derives terrifying new powers.[CR]Once again the Prince of Persia must stand to fight, but this time he will be stronger than ever, thanks to his new alter ego the Dark Prince, borne of the Prince's contact with the Sands. As he fights to reclaim his kingdom from the hands of a madman, he must also battle with his own inner demons as the Dark Prince threatens to consume him entirely.[CR]The game is very similar (in terms of fight and puzzle sequences) to the previous installments of UbiSoft's Prince of Persia trilogy: The Sands of Time and Warrior Within. There are some major innovations like the character of Dark Prince, who possess the main protagonist from time to time and offers him new combos and moves. There is also new ability, called "Speed Kill", which is very effective against all opponents in the game (victims are attacked from behind and murdered in brutal and stealthy fashion).</plot>

It also lets the player use a big amount of acrobatic skills, such as walking on walls and swinging on ledges. Additionally, there are a lot of puzzles in the game, mainly focusing on moving objects and trying to open locked doors. Some of them require special abilities gained by freeing the Sisters of Time.

		<plot>ProStroke Golf: World Tour 2007 is a golf simulation which unique feature is the innovative control scheme. In contrast to other golf simulations the tee is performed in first person mode. After choosing the club and the feet position the player needs to use both analog sticks. With the left one he simulates the swing and with the right one he relocates his body weight. It is not enough to relocate it simply in the right direction, the player needs to achieve a constant back and forth movement.[CR]This only works when using a gamepad, alternatively there is also a more traditional three-click control scheme in 3rd person. There the player chooses the body weight movement before the strike. With the first click he strikes out, with the second one he determines the precision and with the last one the strength. This, however, is still different to other golf simulations because the kind of swing is not chosen beforehand but determined by the swing parameters.[CR]Less innovative are the playing modes. The game features the usual training, single tournament and career mode. The career mode however are just many tournaments tacked together. The player character improves his rank with successes but this just influences the conditions of participation for other tournaments and not the gameplay itself.[CR]The game features nine licensed golfers, 18 courses (two licensed) and three real-life golf-commentators. With the editor the player can build own courses and tournaments.</plot>

Therefore, a special unit is formed to deal with such a threat, a special unit called the Pursuit Force. You are part of that unit.[CR]Your task is to hunt down the criminals and let none escape. To do so, you will drive your fast car on the streets while being perfectly able to switch the vehicles on the run. Yes, on the run, you can jump from car to car during high speed, usually jumping on the different cars from the criminals and taking them out one by one. But there's more to that than just driving different cars, you can drive motorcycles, trucks, boats, even commandeer a helicopter, though there are occasions you'll have to deal with the criminals on foot.[CR]You can select Time Trial, Race, or Career mode. The latter one plays story-wise which gives you certain variety of cases to choose from. As you get promoted while successfully solving the cases, new cases will become available depending upon your rank, from mere Officer to police Commander. This is a highly fast-paced game with non-stop action, as most missions leave very little room for mistakes.</plot>

		<plot>Accord, teacher of the local magic school, has lost her magic flying cane. There is word of an award so the students are busy searching high and low for it. Naturally, our heroes Amitie and her school nemesis Raffine make their way toward the distant dark castle, challenging - and being challenged by - everyone you come across in a game of Puyo Pop.[CR]Puyo Pop Fever is a puzzle game of the falling-block variety, the goal of which is to clear your blocks (Puyos) by combining four or more of the same color, which will then vanish. This will produce Nuisance Puyos. These colorless Puyos will fall onto your opponents screen, thus blocking chains and combos they could create. These pesky Puyos can only be exterminated by removing neighboring Puyos.[CR]When an opponent sends Nuisance Puyos to your screen you can try to "offset" by clearing your own Puyos and limiting the number that would fall on your screen. This will also increase your Fever Meter. When this meter fills you will be given a set of prearranged Puyos with which you can wrack up giant combos and send tons of Nuisance Puyos to your opponent. When any player's field becomes so full that they can no longer drop Puyos they lose the game.[CR]The game features a two-player mode. Some versions allow for more people such as the DS version which allows up to eight players to compete in free-for-all or team modes.</plot>

		<rom name="redump.psp.p2/Puzzle Bobble Pocket (Japan).zip" size="9149414"/>
		<plot>Puzzle Bobble Pocket (パズルボブル ポケット), is the 2004 PSP Japanese release based on Taito's 1986 tile-matching arcade puzzle video game Bubble Bobble. Bust-A-Move is the title used for the game series in North America.[CR]Gameplay follows the standard formula: the player controls a catapult at the bottom of the play field that shoots bubbles of random colors. When three or more bubbles of the same color touch, they are removed from the field. After a while, the existing bubbles are pushed down into the play field by a descending ceiling or by more bubbles being added from the top. The game is lost when the bubbles reach the bottom. Special bubbles include explosive ones that destroy bubbles they touch, bowling balls that knock off all bubbles in their path, star bubbles that remove all bubbles of the same color as the bubble they are touched by, and rainbow bubbles that change color into the color of a bubble group that gets popped adjacent to them.[CR]There are four modes to choose from: Single, Endless, VS and Survival. Single is the classic single-player puzzle game, featuring 500 levels. The goal in each is to clear the pre-set pattern of bubbles. Endless is the unwinnable variant in which more bubbles are always pushed in from the top, played for high score. VS is the competitive variant played against a number of CPU opponents, where popping more than the required three bubbles sends them over to the opponent's field. Survival is a variant of the VS game: after winning a round, the own play field is not reset.</plot>

		<plot>Puzzle Chronicles is a casual game that combines item-matching puzzling with RPG elements, including character progression and a fantasy story line in the vein of Infinity's earlier titles Puzzle Quest: Challenge of the Warlords and Puzzle Kingdoms.[CR]The puzzle part is played on a board with vertical divider line in the middle. The goal is to push the divider line back to decrease the opponent's territory until no more moves are possible. This is done by matching groups of three gems into like colours along the divider line. These groups fall on the board horizontally. Pushing the divider line back is done by destroying rage gems. There are also special abilities and a sidekick known as a Warbeast that attacks the enemy when a sufficient amount of gems of certain colour has been cleared.[CR]Removing gems also enables the player to collect mana, power spells and items that are then used to attack the opponent and reduce their board space. In addition to the main puzzle game, there are five other mini-games ranging from upgrading the Warbeast companion to crafting new items, while navigating a number of different maps and completing simple quests.</plot>

		<plot>Set in the Warlords universe, Puzzle Quest challenges gamers to create, develop and customize the ultimate hero to save the land of Etheria from the evil Lord Bane. In order to advance, players battle in turn-based, head-to-head "match-three" style puzzle games in one of three distinct gameplay modes: Single-player allows gamers to battle against the computer AI as they embark on over 150 challenging quests, Instant Action allows gamers to jump in and immediately play continuous battles to level-up characters without participating in quests, and Multiplayer allows gamers to battle live opponents via wireless connectivity. Victory will advance the player's hero, magical arsenal, creature companions and more - ultimately rewarding gamers at nearly every turn and providing endless hours of replayablity.</plot>

		<plot>The first Rengoku was a surprise hit for many PSP® gamers. Featuring a compelling story about a cyborg yearning to escape its life of never ending battle, Rengoku provided a new and exciting world to battle through on the PSP®. Now gamers will return to the world of Rengoku as they battle their way through the towering structure of Purgatory and the Seven Deadly Sins!

		<plot>The Navy SEALs are invading the PSP for a second covert campaign, one that will take handheld owners through 14 non-linear missions with dynamically changing objectives. Commanders guide a two-man team across multiple terrain types as they strive to build "command equity" and "local influence" through successful stealth and tactical operations. By rescuing civilians, completing goals, and uncovering bonus objectives, players will earn points to spend on weapons or military support in the form of supply drops and air strikes. Black market equipment and intelligence can also be acquired from the local populace, improving the SEAL team's chances for success.[CR]An entry in the SOCOM series wouldn't be complete without multiplayer options, and Fireteam Bravo 2 includes wireless support for up to 16 players in both Ad-hoc and Infrastructure modes. Three new game types are introduced in this sequel, including a capture-the-flag variant, and users are now able to create custom tournaments, ladders, and even clan challenges. Fireteam Bravo 2 also offers an improved friends list and instant messaging to help simplify the process of finding worthy teammates and opponents. As in the first PSP title, Fireteam Bravo 2 lets owners of the PS2 version link the two games to unlock special features in both SOCOM titles.</plot>

		<plot>Tactical Strike is the third hand-held game in the long-line of the SOCOM series. This one differs from its console cousins. Not only can the player choose to control a squad of US Navy Seals, but the player can alternatively decide to control one of several foreign units that have roles comparable to the SEALS, such as the Dutch KCT, German KSK, Australian SASR, the Italian 9th Parachute Assault Regiment, the Spanish UOE, the British SAS, the French GIGN or the South Korean 707th Special Mission Unit.[CR]The story takes place in Panama, as the players national ambassador and the Panamanian ambassador are seized by a local group of rebel narcotrafficante kidnappers, referred to as "La Mano Los Gente" -- though it is worth noting that this is egregiously ungrammatical Spanish, since it would translate literally as "The Hand The People," because the "de" is missing! The fictional group of criminals, with their comical name, hold the pair for ransom and it is up to the player to conduct an increasingly complex and difficult operation in order to rescue the two diplomats.[CR]The gameplay is different from other SOCOM games, in that there remains a squad of four men to control, but instead of bringing up a menu interface and then pointing the cursor to a certain location to give an order, this new game features a locator box that is moved along the surface of the ground. This lets the player choose a specific target location or rally point as the case may be, and then to use a certain button to instruct soldiers to take cover, establish crossfire, defend, ambush, etc. One can, of course, order them to use particular weapons such as close combat knives, rifles, satchel charges for demolition, pistols, a shot fired by the squad's sniper, or thrown grenades. When choosing an aimpoint to throw a grenade, a dynamically adjustable moving arc appears, to show what trajectory it will follow.[CR]There are nine different non-linear missions to play, with the option of two instant action missions for each stage, and the story is told with pre-rendered cut-scenes.</plot>

		<plot>Samurai Warriors: State of War is set in civil war Japan, when great commanders such as Nobunaga Oda, Shingen Takeda, and Kenshin Uesugi struggled for control of the country. Arm yourself with classic Japanese weaponry such as katanas and shuriken, and launch into the chaos of 16th century Japan. The action is relentless, and ranges from massive open-field warfare to sieges of trap-laden castles. With a variety of unique characters, moves, and environments, Samurai Warriors: State of War will give you an unrivalled taste of Japan's most volatile era. Many prominent figures from Japanese history make their appearance in Samurai Warriors: State of War, including the legendary soldier Yukimura Sanada, the revolutionary Nobunaga Oda, and the enigmatic ninja Hattori Hanzo. Each character has signature weapons and skills, as well as their unique role to play in this dramatic epic. State of War's "Battlefield Area System" divides the battlefield into smaller, strategic sections, making the game perfect for quick, portable play. In addition, there are many long-term elements that will keep you coming back for more, such as the raising of character and equipment stats.</plot>

		<plot>Scarface: Money. Power. Respect is a unique game designed specifically for the PSP system that combines turn-based strategy gameplay with real-time combat. It allow gamers to relive Tony Montana's epic rise to power in the drug-fueled world of 1983 Miami. The game thrusts players into a deep and engaging strategy game as Tony Montana, where the goal is to battle and defeat competing drug cartels and conquer Miami turf-by-turf, eventually becoming the one-and-only Kingpin of the city. Featuring both single- and multi-player modes, Scarface: Money. Power. Respect. will challenge players to make critical strategic decisions to rise from humble beginnings to directing an army of henchmen and hired gunmen through detailed scenarios of conquest and domination. In the story-based single-player mode, gamers complete a series of missions based on scenes from the original movie to conquer "turfs" in Miami. Players need to direct large-scale citywide strategic commands to complete their conquest as well as direct street-level real-time combat. The game challenges gamers to handle larger territory, additional adversaries and new profit-making opportunities through increased drug trafficking. The wireless multi-player mode pits up-to-four gamers playing as criminal cartels in a race to make money and conquer turf. The multi-player battle begins with a "Land Grab," where each cartel lays claim to their share of Miami.</plot>

		<plot>The console version of Championship Manager 2006 is in many ways similar as the PC version. Players select a club from one of many different countries and play the manager's role, taking charge of tactics, training, signing new players, negotiating contracts etc. The game is very statistics heavy and assumes a fairly deep knowledge of the football game, setting it apart from its more accessible competitors.[CR]Since this version was released some months after the PC version it features updated stats to reflect changes in the leagues. Additionally it features new camera angles for viewing the playing field and a new interface more intuitive for the consoles.</plot>

		<plot>Clank's on a mission. His best buddy, Ratchet, has been framed by a ruthless enemy and jailed for a crime he did not commit. Not only that, but Ratchet's maximum security prison is full of the universe's most dangerous criminals most of whom are lining up to personally 'welcome' Ratchet into his new cell. Luckily for Ratchet he's got Clank on the outside, and luckily for Clank he's the kind of brainy little robot who is cool under pressure and knows a thing or two about tracking down a mysterious enemy. That's why, as Secret Agent Clank, he's hot on the trail of clues to unravel the mystery and secure Ratchet's release from jail. Unleash Clank's cutting edge array of weapons and gadgets, such as Cufflink Bombs, Tie-a-Rangs, Spy Sunglasses and the ever helpful Holo-Disguise Monocle. Launch into a variety of gameplay styles from all-out action to cunning stealth and brain-busting puzzle solving.

		<plot>Senjō no Valkyria 3: Unrecorded Chronicles (戦場のヴァルキュリア3 Senjō no Varukyuria?), usually referred to as Valkyria Chronicles III, is a tactical role-playing game developed and published by Sega for the PlayStation Portable. It is the third game in the Valkyria Chronicles series and was released on January 27, 2011 exclusively in Japan. An expanded version of the game, subtitled Extra Edition was released in Japan on November 23, 2011.[2] The game features an opening song もしも君が願うのなら (Moshimo Kimi ga Negauno Nara?) sung by Japanese singer May'n.[CR]Occurring in the same time frame as the first game, Valkyria Chronicles III is a side story that follows the exploits of an unwanted and castigated Gallian Army squad during the Imperial invasion of 1935.[3] Contrasting the previous games' bright outlook and recognition for their protagonists, Valkyria Chronicles III explores the themes of being outcast and the search for redemption. As described by its catchphrase, the game tells "The tale of nameless soldiers who, on the verge of despair, changed history."[CR]The game was the first in the series to not officially be translated into English by Sega. However, an unofficial fan translation for the Extra Edition was eventually released in December 2013.</plot>

		<plot>A modern-day Japanese college student is about to go on a date with his girlfriend Kumiko, who has found a particularly interesting book about ancient Japanese history in the local library. On the way to the date the young man is attacked by demonic creatures and saved by the devil summoner Kyōji Kuzunoha. Shortly thereafter, Kumiko is kidnapped by a mysterious man named Sid Davis, who hunts her boyfriend down and kills him. It appears that Kyōji was killed as well, but the student's soul is miraculously transferred into his body. Taking Kyōji's identity, the young man must now fill his place as a devil summoner, liberating the city from demons and locating Sid Davis in an attempt to rescue Kumiko.[CR]Devil Summoner continues the tradition of Megami Tensei games, being a role-playing game with a heavy emphasis on dungeon crawling and communication with randomly encountered enemies. Unlike the main Shin Megami Tensei series, the game is set entirely in modern-day Japan. The player navigates the protagonist on an overhead city map, while individual locations are maze-like 3D dungeons explored from a first-person perspective. For the most part the player controls the main protagonist and his associate Rei, while the other four available slots of an active party can be occupied by summoned demons.[CR]Both human characters can use either swords or guns in battles, their efficiency depending on the particular enemy's weaknesses. Weapons as well as ammunition for guns can be bought in shops. Rei and many demons can also cast a variety of offensive, supportive, and healing magic spells. First-person combat is turn-based, with player-controlled characters positioned in two rows, which affects their attack and defense values. When the hero and Rei level up the player must manually raise their parameters, further customizing their combat performance.[CR]The player can avoid fighting randomly appearing enemies by opting to have a conversation with them. These conversations are more complex than in Shin Megami Tensei games, featuring a wider selection of dialogue choices. They may result in the demon joining the party or exchanging items, and their outcome depends on the demon's personality type and current moon phase as well. Demons consume a type of energy known as magnetite when summoned, which is gained from defeating enemies and can be exchanged for money and vice versa. Two or three demons can be fused in special locations to create more powerful ones.[CR]In addition, the game introduces a "loyalty" system: newly recruited demons have various degrees of loyalty, and might even disobey the player's orders in battles if their loyalty level is too low. Loyalty can be increased through various means, depending on the personality of the demon. Most demons would gradually become loyal when repeatedly summoned and taken to fight enemies.</plot>

		<plot>The rumor going around St. Hermelin High School holds that if you play the "Persona" game, you can see what the future holds for you. When a group of students-some eager, some skeptical-tries the game out, they experience something quite different. Before long, the city is turned upside-down and demons are roaming the streets, and only the students' newfound power of Persona can set things right again. Whether you pursue Takahisa Kandori and his abuses of the power he wields as SEBEC's president, or whether you delve into the curse of the Snow Queen that has plagued St. Hermelin for decades, a deep, modern, psychological tale awaits. Remember your true self, and free the tortured psyches of others...</plot>

New to the series are a depiction of Silent Hill's demonic alter-dimension as a world of ice, and the removal of weapons from the game - when the monsters come out, Harry must literally run for his life.[CR]Between scenes, the game will cut to a psychiatrist's office, who asks you personal questions about yourself and your past experiences. The game will then alter itself based on your responses, changing characters and lines of dialog to something intended to be more personally uncomfortable.[CR]As you search for Cheryl, you will come across objects and recordings that tell some of the history of Silent Hill. The Wii Remote controls a flashlight aimed in real-time. Harry's cell phone accepts calls and messages from both the real and the supernatural, and a camera function is used to uncover hidden ghosts and their messages.</plot>

		<plot>Since the dawn of time, the inhabitants of Nelwë have relied on mighty elemental wizards to keep order. But the invention of steam power has overturned this ancient social order. Disillusioned by the introduction of new technology, certain sections of the population have turned instead to the power of nature. Taking advantage of the conflicts tearing apart the factions of nature and science, the forces of darkness lay siege to the magic domains in an attempt to seize power.[CR]From the peaks of Silverfall the Fair to the mist-enshrouded city of Cloudworks, Players must fight these dark forces, choosing to rely on either science or magic to help them. Whichever they choose will determine the pathy they follow through-out the game.</plot>

		<plot>Bart Simpson goes to a video game store and buys a new ultra-violent Grand Theft Scratchy game, which is promptly confiscated by his mother Marge. Suddenly, a video game manual lands right in front of him. Miraculously, after having read the manual, the members of the Simpsons family discover that each of them possesses a unique superpower. Toying with these, however, attracts the attention of the aliens Kang and Kodos, who decide to invade the Earth. Now the unlikely superheroes must not only protect the town of Springfield from an alien assault, but also find the true reason behind their newly acquired powers, and perhaps their very existence.[CR]The Simpsons Game is a 3D action game with platforming and light puzzle-solving elements, based on the long-running cartoon. The game is divided into sixteen episodes, each containing cutscenes reminiscent of the original Simpsons TV series. Every episode is set in a different environment; some of the scenarios are based in Springfield, while others take the player into meta-virtual worlds. Some of the episodes parody a popular game or genre, having names like Medal of Homer or Neverquest. Each stage features two members of the Simpson clan working together to achieve the goal. Players must switch back and forth using each family members' unique powers to complete the level. Most of the game's versions allow two-player cooperative play.[CR]The four controllable characters have their own unique abilities, which are used for combat, puzzle-solving, or exploration-related purposes. Homer can expand into a rolling blob or inflate himself with helium and float for a while; later, he learns a few other transformation abilities. Bart can become Bartman, using a grappling hook to access certain areas, as well as move upwards in air streams with his cape. Lisa's main ability is called "Hand of Buddha", which is used mainly for moving around large objects; she can also play her saxophone to stun or confuse enemies. Finally, Marge can gather people with her megaphone and control their actions, as well as send the little Maggie into crawlspaces only she can access. Some of these abilities have limited uses and must be either recharged or replenished with special items, while others are available only at specific trigger points.</plot>

		<rom name="redump.psp.p2/Snoopy vs. the Red Baron (USA).zip" size="298401154"/>
		<plot>As Snoopy sleeps atop his doghouse, the player is transported into his dreams about the adventures of his alter ego, the "World Famous WWI Flying Ace." The rest of the Peanuts characters are woven into his dream - and thereby the game's narrative - as they pass by the sleeping beagle. Lucy Van Pelt becomes the commander of the Allied forces, Linus and Sally take humorous turns as intelligence officers, while poor Charlie Brown is characteristically cast as a janitor in an Allied airbase. The story moves quickly after Charlie Brown is captured by the Red Baron's minions along with the plans for a secret weapon that could change the course of the war. Snoopy and his co-pilot Woodstock take to the skies in his trusty Sopwith Camel to recover the plans and rescue Snoopy’s hapless owner.[CR]The game mechanics center around third-person action adventure flight in contexts such as aerial races, dogfighting missions, and world exploration. Collectible items in the world unlock plane and weapon upgrades, as well as new character/plane combinations for use in versus multiplayer aerial combat. Hardcore Peanuts fans will recognize the front lines at Verdun, the woods of Montsec and Verdon Gorge as the settings for Snoopy’s original Flying Ace adventures in the comic strip by Charles M. Schulz. The game features 7 of these locations, which often change considerably from mission to mission.[CR]The flight model for Snoopy's Sopwith Camel and the other planes in the game leans heavily towards the fanciful arcade end of the realism spectrum. Controls and collision are forgiving and approachable for younger players, although advanced stunts such as barrel rolls and Immelmans are accessible through button combos for experienced aficionados of the air combat genre. The game includes boss sequences that offer novel variations on its core mechanics. For example, players will battle a flotilla of submarines as Woodstock, being towed behind Snoopy's plane in a toy balsa-wood glider. Here the mechanics are those of a rail shooter, with Snoopy pulling the player along a path while the player contends with a multi-stage boss fight.[CR]Pre-rendered cut scenes advance the narrative between missions as the player returns to a "hub world" represented by Charlie Brown's neighborhood. Here the player can upgrade his plane and weapons at Pig-Pen's Shop or complete a series of tutorials at Marcie's Flight School. The music and voiceovers in these sequences recall the classic Peanuts holiday specials that have been an annual fixture of American television since 1965.</plot>

		<plot>The Chao have disappeared and Sonic the Hedgehog and Miles "Tails" Prower immediately get on the case to find them. It turns out that Eggman Nega (once again masquerading as Doctor Eggman) has stolen the Chao and concealed them inside a haunted mansion. His plan is to feed them to an inter-dimensional beast called the "Ifrit" who needs to eat them to become invincible . After that, he plans to release the Ifrit into the world in order to destroy it. However, to open the portal to the Ifrit's world, the seven Chaos Emeralds are required. Eggman Nega secretly hires Rouge the Bat to collect the Chaos Emeralds. The Master Emerald has also gone missing (again) and Knuckles the Echidna teams up with Rouge to find it.[CR]Meanwhile, Silver the Hedgehog has returned from a now ruined future caused by the Ifrit. In order to make a happier future, he searches for and steals the Chao that are left in order to hide them. Espio first thought that Silver was hiding Chao for a cause of evil, but Espio finds out that Silver was trying to save the world. Then, they work together to save the world. The real Dr. Eggman sends Metal Sonic to find Shadow, and tells him of Nega's plans. Nega has learned of the Ifrit by accessing Professor Gerald Robotnik's journals, and Shadow and Metal Sonic set out to retrieve the Chaos Emeralds before he does. Eggman uses Metal Sonic as a communication device to aid Shadow along the way.[CR]All of the teams meet up at the Mystic Haunt Zone where the portal to the Ifrit's world is. Despite Rouge only collecting six of the Emeralds, the portal opens anyway and Nega dispatches his newly copy of Metal Sonic, Metal Sonic 3.0 to awaken the Ifrit. Despite possessing the minds of Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, and Rouge (depending on who the player plays as), the Ifrit is defeated by the other teams. Shadow and Metal Sonic defeat the Ifrit and close the portal but they and Eggman Nega are trapped in the Ifrit's dimension. However, Metal Sonic tears his chassis open, revealing the 7th Chaos Emerald. Shadow uses the Emerald to teleport back with Metal Sonic. Nega is left trapped under some rubble.[CR]Sonic and Tails save all the Chao and bring them to a Chao Garden and relax there while Knuckles finds the Master Emerald in the Emerald Detector that he and Rouge stole from Eggman Nega. Rouge steals the Master Emerald and runs, and Silver returns to what he hopes is a happy future. Espio has to answer to Vector the Crocodile who has spent their client's advanced payment on late rental fees.</plot>

		<plot>The PSP received its own adaptation of the superhero sequel Spider-Man 2. Unlike the console version with its open-world design, the PSP game is strictly linear. Spider-Man must make his way through 19 levels, each presenting him with a series of challenges. He must beat up thugs and robots, save a police car from dropping from a bridge, turn on the sprinkler system in a burning warehouse, carry away civilians from a failed fusion experiment, rescue hostages in a museum and much more. Spidey can swing from buildings, pull himself up to the ceiling and crawl on walls to get around. To defeat the many enemies, he can use a variety of kicks and punches which can be built up into combos. His webbing comes into play in various ways: he can shoot it at enemies to knock them out temporarily and must also use it to complete various objectives, like fixing leaky pipes for the sprinkling system. During the game, Spidey earns Hero Points, which can be spent after each level to unlock new moves and some bonuses. Hero Points are awarded for completing a level, using combos, high levels of health and webbing remaining, time used and secret spider symbols found.[CR]The game follows the story of the film only loosely (in the levels concerning Doctor Octopus). Many other Spider-Man villains are featured and must be defeated, including Mysterio, the Rhino, the Shocker and the Vulture. The story is told through a mixture of pre-rendered and in-game cutscenes, for which film actors Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, Alfred Molina and JK Simmons reprise their roles.</plot>

The story is told through a mixture of pre-rendered and in-game cutscenes, for which film actors Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, Alfred Molina and JK Simmons reprise their roles.</plot>

		<plot>Based off the 2007 movie of the same name, Spider-Man 3 puts players in charge of the titular hero as he tries to once again New York City safe from the combined menace of the New Goblin, the Sandman, and Venom.[CR]The game style is similar to Spider-Man 2 in which the player is free to explore a large scale version of New York City in a "Sandbox" style, this time in a larger city that allows for exploration of the subway and sewer systems. The game also allows for players to adventure in storylines not explored in the third film, such as facing familiar Spider-Man villains like Kraven, the Lizard, Scorpion, Rhino and the Kingpin, or breaking up various gang factions.[CR]One of the main focal points of the new game is the inclusion of Spider-Man's black symbiote costume. When wearing the traditional red and blue costume, Spider-Man is more fast and is more accepted by the public. When wearing the black costume, Spider-Man becomes stronger and more aggressive.[CR]The game also includes "cineractives" - cinematic scenes that allow for participation via button presses or controller movements.[CR]This version also has the inclusion of Morbius and Shriek as bosses to fight against. The black costume is an interchangeable accessory after a certain point in the game, but can threaten to overwhelm Peter if worn too long.</plot>

		<plot>Vertigo is a mix of the concepts of Marble Madness and the Monkey Ball series, but set in a futuristic environment. Players need to guide a shiny ball dubbed a xorb through high-tech environments at a high speed. The tracks are narrow and it is easy to drop off at any time, so precise steering is needed.[CR]Games can be played in an arcade mode with forking paths or in a career mode where new tracks are unlocked gradually. Courses are time-limited and set in very different environments. Checkpoint allow the player to respawn at certain sections. While playing, power-ups can be collected to access air brakes and other bonuses. The xorbs can be completely customized in terms of colour. Other game modes are time trial, three multiplayer modes and a bowling mini-game. In certain game modes the xorbs can be armed with weapons such as rockets and missiles, which also deform the xorb when taking damage.</plot>

The events take place between Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith and Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope.

She was assigned by the Rebel Alliance to steal a partial set of schematics for the Death Star. The game features famous Star Wars locations such as Danuta, Coruscant, the Death Star, Mustafar, and Tatooine, with familiar characters like Kyle Katarn, Boba Fett, Princess Leia and Darth Vader.[CR]The game also features Ad Hoc multiplayer for 2 players, also with Twi'lek vs. Twi'lek games. Throughout the game, puzzles are solved by playing mini-games, based on the memory and logical thinking.</plot>

		<plot>Star Wars: The Clone Wars - Republic Heroes bridges the gap between season one and two of the animated TV series. In the game the player learns more about the mysterious bounty hunter Cad Bane and hunts down the all-new Skakoan super villain Kul Teska in a gameplay style very similar to Lego Star Wars.[CR]The game is fully built around drop in/drop out-coop for two players. This means each mission in this 3rd-person-action-adventure features two famous characters from the TV series including Obi-Wan Kenobi, the padawan Ahsoka and Captain Rex but separated by class. The players either control commandos or Jedi characters - never both mixed as they have totally different abilities and limitations. If no second player is available, the AI will automatically take over the second character and help overcome the many obstacles waiting ahead - mostly in form of several different kinds of separatist droids. While the players can use their lightsaber or blaster to fend them off, the Jedi characters also have the ability to ride the droids by jumping onto them from behind. This is not only useful to blast through enemy lines but is also used to solve specific riddles preventing the characters from moving on. In addition the droids can be forced to dance with every other droid on the screen following his lead making them defenseless. These dances are unique for each droid and need to be bought first in the shop. Also available there: funny masks and combat upgrades like stronger blasters or a more powerful force-push.[CR]To buy these things, the players have to unlock them first and then need to invest points which are gained by killing enemies as well as by successfully completing missions or the mini-games. These mini-games are scattered around the levels and turn up once a specific section has been completed. They mostly involve killing as many enemies as possible in a short amount of time. Each kill in succession both during normal gameplay and the mini-games also ranks up the multiplier adding even more points to the account. Once a player dies, he will respawn at the nearest checkpoint either immediately if he plays alone or after the second player has reached one - both times without any penalties.</plot>

		<rom name="redump.psp.p2/Star Wars Battlefront - Elite Squadron (Europe) (En,Fr,De,Es,It).zip" size="1218688912"/>
		<plot>Star Wars Battlefront: Elite Squadron is a third-person shooter video game, part of the Star Wars: Battlefront series released November 3, 2009 on the Nintendo DS and PlayStation Portable.[CR]Gameplay[CR]Elite Squadron allows players to participate in combat on foot, in ground vehicles or in space. Players are also able to enter capital ships and, once the shields are down, fight the enemy inside on foot. The ground-space transitions are accompanied by short cutscenes while the game loads the next area. The same is also true of entering or exiting a capital ship. This is the first Battlefront game to allow players to fly from ground to space battles. The consequences of each battle will depend on the players actions, meaning that each individual enemy killed can affect the outcome of a result. The battlefront will not be one giant, seamless map, but a compilation of inter-connected, smaller size areas, each one capable of affecting the other.[CR]Elite Squadron features "Heroes and Villains" gameplay.[CR]It includes playable characters such as Luke Skywalker, Boba Fett, Darth Vader, Darth Maul, The Emperor and Kit Fisto, and the Heroes and Villains mode (Assault Mode) last featured in Star Wars: Battlefront II. Pre-release screenshots also show that General Rahm Kota, a character from Star Wars: The Force Unleashed is playable, as well as other characters from Renegade Squadron, such as Col Serra. The Heroes and Villains mode is displayed quite conveniently after a demo had been released on the PlayStation Network. Other game modes have been implied, with a focus on multiplayer, such as a deathmatch mode. Also, the Galactic Conquest mode, has undergone an enhancement on the PSP. In Galactic Conquest, two players are able to share a single PSP, and compete against each other in a strategy based game mode. PSP Players are able to mix elements from the Star Wars saga and put them into locations and situations that never happened, allowing for full customization. The story mode has been called "a huge step up from previous story modes", and was praised for incorporating the controls into the mission. It was also revealed that making progress in the story, and completing objectives, was the way to unlock customization props.</plot>

		<plot>Star Wars Battlefront: Elite Squadron is a third-person shooter video game, part of the Star Wars: Battlefront series released November 3, 2009 on the Nintendo DS and PlayStation Portable.[CR]Gameplay[CR]Elite Squadron allows players to participate in combat on foot, in ground vehicles or in space. Players are also able to enter capital ships and, once the shields are down, fight the enemy inside on foot. The ground-space transitions are accompanied by short cutscenes while the game loads the next area. The same is also true of entering or exiting a capital ship. This is the first Battlefront game to allow players to fly from ground to space battles. The consequences of each battle will depend on the players actions, meaning that each individual enemy killed can affect the outcome of a result. The battlefront will not be one giant, seamless map, but a compilation of inter-connected, smaller size areas, each one capable of affecting the other.[CR]Elite Squadron features "Heroes and Villains" gameplay.[CR]It includes playable characters such as Luke Skywalker, Boba Fett, Darth Vader, Darth Maul, The Emperor and Kit Fisto, and the Heroes and Villains mode (Assault Mode) last featured in Star Wars: Battlefront II. Pre-release screenshots also show that General Rahm Kota, a character from Star Wars: The Force Unleashed is playable, as well as other characters from Renegade Squadron, such as Col Serra. The Heroes and Villains mode is displayed quite conveniently after a demo had been released on the PlayStation Network. Other game modes have been implied, with a focus on multiplayer, such as a deathmatch mode. Also, the Galactic Conquest mode, has undergone an enhancement on the PSP. In Galactic Conquest, two players are able to share a single PSP, and compete against each other in a strategy based game mode. PSP Players are able to mix elements from the Star Wars saga and put them into locations and situations that never happened, allowing for full customization. The story mode has been called "a huge step up from previous story modes", and was praised for incorporating the controls into the mission. It was also revealed that making progress in the story, and completing objectives, was the way to unlock customization props.</plot>

		<plot>After an era of political unrest in the early 21st century, the world's leaders have fallen and natural resources have been depleted. This results in the downfall of the world economy and leads to a series of bloody conflicts in a world where the less fortunate strive for survival and live for one reason.... illegal racing.[CR]In StateShift, racing machines with highly advanced morphing abilities compete in illegal underground races around the world. Drivers go one on one with up to fifteen racers across nine tournaments. The titular stateshifts refer to special power-ups the player can unlock. With names such as «Dragster», «Ghost», «Mamouth» and «Scorch», they can be used to drive faster or take corners more sharply, but require picking up energy cells on the tracks to recharge. The game has various modes including Career Mode to unlock new tournaments, tracks, characters and stateshifts, Time Trial, Challenges, Quick Race and various tutorials. The game also has a multiplayer mode via Wi-Fi.</plot>

		<plot>Street Fighter Alpha 3 MAX is a conversion of the 2D arcade fighter Street Fighter Alpha 3. Featuring a roster of 37 characters, including 3 (Maki, Yun, Eagle) never seen outside of the GBA version, and 1 brand-new character (Ingrid) to the game, all with their own storyline, you can spend a very long time learning the intricacies of all the fighters.[CR]It includes all the novelties introduced in the Alpha series, including finite defenses, the ability to recover and isms to customize special attacks. To help avoid the typical repetitiveness of the game, all the modes available in the previous home versions of Alpha 3, such as Arcade Mode, Training Mode, Edit Mode, World Tour, Dramatic Battle and Survival modes are all available in this version, along with the brand-new 100-man kumite (survival) and tag-team battle modes.[CR]The PSP version also has network games (Ad-Hoc only) for up to 8 players, with four additional modes: VS Mode, Team Mode, Variable Battle (take three players into battle of which you control two, and the computer one), and the Dramatic Battle with multiple fighters going at it simultaneously.</plot>

		<plot>Super Fruitfall is a simple tile matching game. The playing field is a frame which is differently shaped in every level, e.g. sometimes a regular square or a tube. The interior space also features different forms. Fruits are spread out in this frame which the player can rotate either left, right or 180°. Then of course the fruits start falling and if multiple of the same kind touch each other they vanish. The goal of a level is to get rid of every fruit.[CR]There are 50 levels and four playing modes: arcade (solving as many levels as possible in a limited time), time challenge (solving one level with the fastest time), training (no clock) and a split-screen mode for two players.</plot>

		<plot>Our four heroes from Super Monkey Ball - Aiai, Meemee, Baby and Gongon - were enjoying a typical day, when they saw a flying machine crash down on a nearby island. Soon, they discovered that the mysterious Naysayers have appeared, spreading discord and unhappiness all over the island. And to top it all off, the prince and princess of the neighboring islands have gone missing on Jungle Island - if they aren't found and returned, there's sure to be trouble! Can our heroes restore order to Monearth?[CR]Super Monkey Ball Adventure takes the monkey rolling madness of the previous games and puts a story-based spin on it. Choosing from one of the four monkeys, Players roll their way around the various islands of Monearth, talking to citizens and performing the tasks they request (such as delivering sandwiches, finding a missing baby, rescuing rare flowers, and more) to cheer them up.[CR]Certain parts of the island are locked by 'Puzzle Gates' - these can only be unlocked by solving the puzzle stages which can be accessed in front of the gate. Each pad transports you to a different Puzzle Realm. The Puzzle Realm stages are the more familiar gameplay of Super Monkey Ball - simple looking stages where players must carefully (but quickly) roll their monkey to the finish line within the time limit.[CR]Bananas can also be collected throughout the game - these are used as currency, and can be used to unlock new playable characters and puzzle stages. They can also be given to particular unhappy citizens. The monkeys will also learn magical chants as they progress through the game - these allow you to climb walls, set your monkey's ball on fire, use a boxing glove to attack, and more.[CR]Also included in Super Monkey Ball Adventure are the famous Party Games - favorites like Monkey Race, Monkey Target and Monkey fight return. There's also three new games: 'Monkey Cannon' - fire monkeys at enemy towers to steal their bricks for your own tower. 'Monkey Bounce' - bounce on a trampoline-like platform with your opponents, and try to claim as many squares as possible. 'Monkey Tag' - roll around a globe and try to collect as many balloons as possible.</plot>

Can our heroes restore order to Monearth?[CR]Super Monkey Ball Adventure takes the monkey rolling madness of the previous games and puts a story-based spin on it. Choosing from one of the four monkeys, Players roll their way around the various islands of Monearth, talking to citizens and performing the tasks they request (such as delivering sandwiches, finding a missing baby, rescuing rare flowers, and more) to cheer them up.[CR]Certain parts of the island are locked by 'Puzzle Gates' - these can only be unlocked by solving the puzzle stages which can be accessed in front of the gate. Each pad transports you to a different Puzzle Realm. The Puzzle Realm stages are the more familiar gameplay of Super Monkey Ball - simple looking stages where players must carefully (but quickly) roll their monkey to the finish line within the time limit.[CR]Bananas can also be collected throughout the game - these are used as currency, and can be used to unlock new playable characters and puzzle stages. They can also be given to particular unhappy citizens. The monkeys will also learn magical chants as they progress through the game - these allow you to climb walls, set your monkey's ball on fire, use a boxing glove to attack, and more.[CR]Also included in Super Monkey Ball Adventure are the famous Party Games - favorites like Monkey Race, Monkey Target and Monkey fight return. There's also three new games: 'Monkey Cannon' - fire monkeys at enemy towers to steal their bricks for your own tower. 'Monkey Bounce' - bounce on a trampoline-like platform with your opponents, and try to claim as many squares as possible. 'Monkey Tag' - roll around a globe and try to collect as many balloons as possible.</plot>

		<plot>Saki Inafune, niece to legendary game developer Keiji Inafune, can't wait to visit her uncle's new theme park. She's been invited to the opening day ceremonies, and is looking forward to a day of fun and excitement when suddenly Count Hogstein - a villain as corpulent and cliche as he is evil - blows up the Ferris wheel, takes the park management hostage, and declares the beginning of a deadly series of games. Desperate to save her uncle, Saki volunteers to be one of the participants in Hogstein's games, and finds herself thrust into the midst of excitement very different from what she'd expected when she woke up that morning. She'll need all of her cunning, determination, and exceptional insight to get herself and her fellow participants - all available bachelors - out alive and maybe, with a little luck, find love along the way.</plot>

		<plot>TMNT for PSP and Nintendo DS is an action game based on the 2007 animated film of the same name. The game's story loosely follows the plot of the movie, in which the four Ninja Turtles have grown apart and must now reunite to combat a new threat to New York. Images and clips (on the PSP only) from the film are used to illustrate the story between levels.[CR]The game consists of 15 stages. In each, the player controls a specific turtle. The game is primarily a platformer, in which the turtles run and jump across rooftops and other environments to get to the end of the level. Jumping works by moving to a glowing hot spot and then pressing one of three buttons that launch a jump to the front, the left or the right (relative to the screen), corresponding to the goal spot. Jumps succeed automatically if the right button is used. Some situations where there are downward slides, ropes to swing on, or walls to climb require pressing a fourth button to charge the jump. Occasionally, another turtle will appear in a level and must be caught up to in a time limit. If successful, he hurls his brother further along the level which gains him a Family Bond. This can be used in the fight sequences of the game, which include fights against a number of goons as well as boss battles. In these, the turtles can use basic attacks, blocks, and various more powerful moves like a swing attack and a powerful charging move. The Family Bonds are used to summon another turtle for extra attacks.[CR]Upon completion of a level, the player is awarded medals for completing goals. These include finishing the level in a short time, collecting all four of the letters T-M-N-T, gaining the Family Bonds and performing jump chains. Chains are created if the hot spot jumps are performed in quick succession. Getting all gold medals in a level unlocks bonuses. Levels can be replayed to improve the performance.[CR]The game also includes a multiplayer component, in which players race each other across a level to see who can get to the end the fastest.</plot>

		<plot>Once, you were Suicide, the fastest rising star of the TNA iMPACT wrestling scene. You blew through some of the fiercest opponents; taking down AJ Styles, devastating Robert Roode, and destroying Booker T., but then... everything changed. The politics behind the ring got heated, and not in your favor. When you finally claimed the title, someone came for you. And now you're here. You've woken up in what appears to be a rundown hospital in Mexico, and you can't remember a thing; your name, what you do, and certainly not why you're here. Lost in a land that is not your own, you need to get back to America. You hear talk of a local wrestling match where the winner goes on to wrestle at a nearby American Air Force base. This is the best shot you've got at getting home. But once you're in the ring, something strange happens. Your body seems to remember what your mind cannot. Punches, grapples, throws, and stomps all come naturally, as if you were a seasoned professional... This is where your journey begins. Find your way home, remember who you were, and claim what was rightfully yours.</plot>

		<plot>Thrillville allows gamers of all ages to easily build and customize the coaster of your dreams. Gone are the days of the complex PC techniques used in other coaster games. Rather, Thrillville's easy to use building mode has been designed specifically for the console platforms and makes building all 75-plus rides from wooden, corkscrew and inverted coasters to merry go rounds, trains and carnival rides, easy, and most importantly, fun. Imagination is the only height limit with Thrillville, where the fun ranges from racing on go-kart tracks you put together and playing mini-golf on courses you designed to joining friends for dozens of four-player party games, from bumper cars to arcade shoot-'em-ups. You can also tour the park on foot - a first for theme-park titles - chatting and joking with all the guests to help them out and make sure they're enjoying themselves.</plot>

		<rom name="redump.psp.p2/Tom Clancy's EndWar (Europe) (En,Fr,De,Es,It).zip" size="162317113"/>
		<plot>The handheld version of Tom Clancy's EndWar is a hex based turn based strategy game similar to the Battle Isle series. The game takes place in the 2020s and a conflict has arisen between the three big powers of the world: Europe, USA and Russia. The single player mode allows the player to play through one campaign for each of the powers. There is also a multi player mode for two players and a map editor that allows for user created maps.[CR]Gameplay consists of two phases: action and movement. When one player is in the movement phase the other is in the action phase. When the phase ends the commands are executed, first the actions and then the movements. This means that units only can move if they first survive the attacks of the enemy. The player has access to both land, air and sea units depending on the mission. The units get experience points when damaging and destroying enemy units. More experience points leads to more powerful and robust units. To get more units the player can capture buildings such as depots, airfields and harbors which can produce a few more units. They can also be used to repair damaged units. Another building is the HQ. When this is captured the player loses the mission. After losing a mission in the campaign mode it's possible to ask for reinforcement units when retrying the mission.[CR]Special tactical manoeuvres of the game include blocking and jamming. Blocking means that the movement of a unit gets limited when its route is threatened by an enemy unit. Jamming involves surrounding an enemy unit with more than one unit which leads to a combat bonus. The bonus depends on the position of the units. Placing a friendly units directly behind the enemy for example leads to a 50% higher bonus. Different units have different capabilities in combat. For example airplanes can only attack other airplanes but not land or sea units. Some units such as the artillery have a larger range and can attack units that are several hexes away from them.</plot>

In total there are nine missions to play in the story modes as well as three unlockable bonus missions.[CR]The core gameplay is still the same, using stealth and shadows to eliminate or subdue targets, collect information and such. The controls have been slightly modified for the PSP, the analog being used for movement while the d-pad is used for the inventory screen, but the most notable feature is holding the "O" button will allow the player to pan around with the camera, while a single tap will reset the camera directly back to the third-person perspective.[CR]As before, gadgets such as night vision, thermal, as well as lockpicks and weapons from the previous games return as well as a new feature designed exclusively for the game, where players can challenge a human opponent via Ad-Hoc in an online spy vs. spy deathmatch.</plot>

		<plot>Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is a game based on the movie of the same name. Set a few years after the defeat of Megatron in the first game/movie, Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen reveals that the threat from the Decepticons has in fact, far from ended. Since the end of the first movie Decepticons have began popping up again all over Earth. They are in search of a mysterious object from space that will gift the balance of power.[CR]The game is a linear third-person shooter that puts the player in control of many of the main characters from the movie, shifting between both Autobot and Decepticon factions. The storyline is told via cutscenes that also allow for the player to easily transition from one character to the other. Playable characters on the Autobot side include: Optimus Prime, Iron Hide, Jetfire, Bumblebee. The Decepticon side includes: Starscream, Sideways (a new character), and Megatron.[CR]Though the game doesn’t allow transform wherever the player wants to, transformation has been introduced as special attacks during robot mode, as fixed alternate game modes (driving Shanghai tunnels as Sideways, and fly through the skies of Russia as Starscream) and, in both robot and vehicle modes, as special moves that give the player alternate abilities. For example, transforming as Starscream while flying will enable him to fly backwards as a robot to take out enemies behind the protagonist.[CR]For multiplayer, at any point during a single-player campaign a friend can join in as a "Remote Weapon System", which allows them to shoot enemies, erect a shield to defend and transfer energon between both players.</plot>

		<plot>Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is a game based on the movie of the same name. Set a few years after the defeat of Megatron in the first game/movie, Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen reveals that the threat from the Decepticons has in fact, far from ended. Since the end of the first movie Decepticons have began popping up again all over Earth. They are in search of a mysterious object from space that will gift the balance of power.[CR]The game is a linear third-person shooter that puts the player in control of many of the main characters from the movie, shifting between both Autobot and Decepticon factions. The storyline is told via cutscenes that also allow for the player to easily transition from one character to the other. Playable characters on the Autobot side include: Optimus Prime, Iron Hide, Jetfire, Bumblebee. The Decepticon side includes: Starscream, Sideways (a new character), and Megatron.[CR]Though the game doesn’t allow transform wherever the player wants to, transformation has been introduced as special attacks during robot mode, as fixed alternate game modes (driving Shanghai tunnels as Sideways, and fly through the skies of Russia as Starscream) and, in both robot and vehicle modes, as special moves that give the player alternate abilities. For example, transforming as Starscream while flying will enable him to fly backwards as a robot to take out enemies behind the protagonist.[CR]For multiplayer, at any point during a single-player campaign a friend can join in as a "Remote Weapon System", which allows them to shoot enemies, erect a shield to defend and transfer energon between both players.</plot>

		<plot>While struggling to evade capture and death in the war-ravaged wilderness, some of these shape-shifter refugees stumble upon a carefully guarded and stunning secret that rekindles hope for freedom and peace to the realm. Can these refugees-turned-heroes bring the last surviving heir of the dynasty to the capital city or will they lead him to the warlord's hand, dooming their race into extinction and their human cousins to endless oppression and strife? Untold Legends The Warrior's Code builds upon the success of the original through an all-new, epic storyline brought to life through dramatic in-game cinematics, a completely new combat experience and enhanced 3D graphics featuring improved graphics, special effects and lighting. Players now experience an evolution in the action-RPG genre through an upgraded combat engine designed for strategic combat, a wider variety of combat moves and special abilities, interactive boss battles with unique AI, and dynamic attacks of opportunity.</plot>

		<plot>This installment of the Smackdown series continues the Smackdown vs. Raw era, which now uses a yearly date in the title, similarly to other sports titles.[CR]The game includes an updated roster of wrestlers, as well as many classic superstars like Bret Hart or British Bulldog. It also includes many new arenas from recent Pay-Per-Views, as well as a classic arena from Wrestlemania 9. A new recorded dialogue for many of the wrestlers is featured in the storyline, as the player goes through many different plots in the Season Mode, chasing the championship belts.[CR]Gameplay has been slightly enhanced, with a larger list of moves available to each wrestler, and pre-match mini-games to start your fight off with and determine who has the upper hand.[CR]Another addition is the General Manager Mode, where the player takes the role of a GM trying to book a weekly show. Taking into account costs to contract wrestlers, keeping a chosen wrestler happy and healthy, and putting on matches and setting up feuds to keep the ratings for the show high are the objectives of this mode.[CR]It is also possible to earn Smackdown Dollars in the game, which the player can use to buy new moves, new create-a-wrestler items, Legends wrestlers, and even furniture to customize a locker room. The player can also earn trophies for his trophy case by completing challenges and beating the GM Mode.</plot>

This game features improvements on the tag team action, including a new Hot-Tag mode, tag team finishers, and new actions to help in the match.[CR]As with the previous game, the roster includes over 60 superstars from Smackdown, Raw and ECW. To keep the roster up-to-date, the game includes a roster editor allowing players to change the superstars on it, as well as change their appearance from face to heel. However, this is also the first game in the Smackdown series since Here Comes the Pain not to feature any legends.[CR]Another new feature is Create-a-Finisher, which allows players to create their own unique finishing move out of over 500 different animations. These can also be shared online during online matches.[CR]The game includes two different story modes: Road to Wrestlemania and Career mode. Road to Wrestlemania mode allows the player to experience six unique stories involving the wrestlers Triple H, CM Punk, Chris Jericho, The Undertaker, John Cena, and a co-op storyline featuring Batista and Rey Mysterio. Career mode is the replacement of GM Mode from previous games. This mode allows the player to make a career for superstars and upgrade custom wrestlers.[CR]Other features include the Highlight Reel, which lets the player create videos from his matches, new Inferno and Gauntlet matches, as well as new positions in the backstage brawl.</plot>

		<plot>WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2011 is a professional wrestling video game that is based on the two brands of WWE, Raw and SmackDown.[CR]One of the main changes in the game is the incorporation of a new physics system that allows objects to be used more realistically, such as objects involved in the Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match. Tables now break differently depending on the impact placed upon them. Inside and outside the ring, ladders can now be rested onto the ring ropes and be broken in half. For the first time since the original WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw game, chairs can be thrown at your opponents.[CR]The Hell in a Cell match is revamped with expanded cell walls, weapons underneath the ring, steel steps near the poles, and the cell door is removed. In addition, the game adds new ways to escape the steel cage.[CR]The game's new "WWE Universe" mode replaces the career mode from previous games. The mode builds storylines, and integrates cut scenes and rivalries between wrestlers based on the matches that are wrestled. These cut scenes appear randomly before, during, and after the match.[CR]Road to WrestleMania mode has been modified to include new features such as backstage roaming, mini-quests, and further interaction with other Superstars. Playable storylines involve Rey Mysterio, John Cena, Christian, and Chris Jericho. Along with that is the new storyline in which players choose Kofi Kingston, John Morrison, Dolph Ziggler, R-Truth, or a created superstar in a quest to end The Undertaker's undefeated WrestleMania streak.</plot>

		<plot>Pinball Hall of Fame: The Williams Collection faithfully recreates eight of the most memorable tables from the golden age of pinball in photorealistic 3D. Working closely with Williams to ensure authenticity of each of the games, the collection is highlighted by some of the most popular and innovative Williams pinball tables, including Gorgar, the first-ever talking pinball machine, Black Knight, which introduced "Magna-Save" and Bonus Ball, and Space Shuttle, which took the pinball industry by storm in 1984. Every table has been meticulously recreated to bring players the visuals, sound effects and gameplay that made these games legendary successes. Pinball Hall of Fame: The Williams Collection harkens back to the arcades of the 1980s. Players begin Pinball Hall of Fame: The Williams Collection with access to four pinball tables, and the remaining four tables are unlocked as the game progresses. Players can spend as little as two minutes on a quick pinball challenge, or delve deeper into the game, gaining rewards in a token-based system as they unlock each of the pinball tables. Single-player Arcade and Challenge modes provide hours of solo entertainment, and a Multiplayer mode lets players face each other head-on.</plot>

		<plot>WipEout Pure is the first adaptation for the PSP of the long-running Wipeout series. Players take part in a futuristic racing league known as the FX300 Racing League and control a fast hovercrafts on tight, cornering tracks, vying for first place in one of many tournaments. There are ten anti-gravity vehicles available to use (two need to be unlocked), each with their own characteristics in speed, handling and acceleration. Vehicles are further divided into classes that are unlocked gradually. In later classes most of the vehicles become much faster and require more precise steering at fast speeds. In the same vein, players can unlock new tournaments.</plot>

		<plot>The 2008 installment of the Winning Eleven: Pro Evolution Soccer series. PES 2008 features a brand new intelligence system, called Teamvision, that adapts and reacts to players own gameplay styles to ensure that the computer controlled opponents are always challenging and forcing the player to think and chance their style of play to avoid being out-thought by the game. It learns counter attacks that target your weaknesses and look to exploit any repetitive tactics players use. Defenders react better to danger, closing down the ball and charging at shots and the goalkeepers hold shots that are closer to them as well. Teammates make more intelligent runs into space and the close control has been sharpened to ensure quick and fluid passing and speedy attacks can be built.</plot>

		<plot>The kingdom of Altago is rebuilding their kingdom around a newfound peace after years of war against the merciless armies of Romn. The classic adventuresome duo, Adol and Dogi, arrive in the harbor of Altago City, and quickly find themselves in a scuffle with the Dragon Knights, the kingdom's military police body, when attempting to save a local girl from harassment by one of their commanding officers. Upset by the interruption and subsequent humiliation, the commander arrests Adol and Dogi, charging them with espionage. The king of Altago, having known of the duo's pending arrival from an old trusted friend, quickly releases the pair from prison and summons them to his chambers. He tells the men about an ancient shrine that was uncovered after a recent earthquake, and asks for their help in investigating this mysterious new find. Adol and Dogi oblige, unaware that they are about to take the first steps on a long journey to save all of Altago from long-forgotten ancient forces, and to reunite the estranged five tribes who serve and protect the Five Great Dragons deified beings who may well be the world's last hope. Ys Sevenis the latest installment in the long-running Ys series which first debuted on PC in 1987. This is the first iteration to be built specifically for the PSP system, taking full advantage of the widescreen format and hardware. The battle system consists of a three-member battle party with enemies engaged on the field map in real-time for fast-paced combat. Old fans of the series and new players alike will be immersed into the rich vibrant world containing over 30 hours of gameplay.</plot>

		<plot>For centuries, an epic battle between humans and evil lords has been raging, destroying everything in its path. Throughout that time, heroes and legends have risen above the chaos, only to eventually disappear into the pages of history. The would-be hero, the narcissistic evil lord, the crossbow-wielding princess...These three were the champions of their eras and even now, still have one last part to play. The civilized world continues to be laid siege to by relentless evil adversaries and all that remains are the ruins of castles and the bodies of the faithful knights who once proudly protected them. As the last wandering sage and final hope for humanity, it is up to the protagonist to somehow transcend time and death to unite these legends and their unique powers in one last battle against the ultimate evil lord.</plot>

		<plot>The goal of the game is clean and simple: As the God of Destruction, you must create a dungeon that is both difficult and powerful enough to fend off the human hero invaders. The dungeon must have a self-sustaining ecosystem, so players must strategically dig and create a dungeon with a balanced food chain. Periodically, human heroes will invade the dungeon, in order to bring peace and harmony to the world. But, they are your enemies. You must destroy the heroes before they capture the Overlord and take him back to the surface.</plot>

		<plot>Known as ZettaiHero Keikakuin Japan, Z.H.P. is the only turn based strategy RPG that allows you to create your own, one and only super hero to fight vicious(?) villains. Players can create a super hero literally from head to toe. If you wish to use drills instead of hands or wheels instead of legs you can do so by simply swapping out your body parts. Battle maps are all randomly generated for mad replay value and there are tons of character and secret base customization. Z.H.P. gives you the chance to relive your childhood fantasy of making your own superhero and superhero base.</plot>
