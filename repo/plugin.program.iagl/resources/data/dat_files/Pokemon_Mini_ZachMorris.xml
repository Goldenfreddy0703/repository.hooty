    <plot>With Pokemon Pinball Mini, the aim is to shoot as many balls as possible into the pockets using the special 'Pokemon Plunger'. The goal is to try and beat the high scores on the different stages and become a genuine Pokemon Pinball Champion.[CR]*Pokemon Pinball Mini has three different play modes, including Quest, Time Attack and Score Attack.[CR]*Quest Mode consists of 70 stages in total, each having a different objective for the player to complete in order to clear the stage.[CR]*Time Attack mode contains 10 stages. In this mode, a limited amount of time is available to complete the stage. The quicker the stage is completed the higher the score earned.[CR]*Score Attack mode also consists of 10 stages. In this mode you must exceed the target score before the time runs out. If there is still time remaining, players can battle on for an even higher score.[CR]An entertaining option is the "Catching Pokemon Stage". Players have a chance to catch Pokemon here to add to their collections and use them when necessary.</plot>

    <plot>Togepi no Daiboken is an action puzzle game similar to Kirby Tilt 'n' Tumble in that the player controls a Togepi who is rolling around like a ball. Traditional controls are used rather than motion controls for movement, though the Pokemon mini system's built-in tilt sensor is occasionally used for escaping when Togepi gets stuck in a hole. Togepi was peacefully walking through the forest when a Fearow noticed it. The Fearow grabs Togepi and takes it to its nest on the top of a tower. Togepi tries to escape, but trips on a pebble, and starts rolling around. The player must guide Togepi down the stairs. Many hazards exist, including bottomless pits, cracked floors, bumpers and many more too numerous to list. Sometimes, the stairs are covered by a door, and puzzles must be solved to open them, such as rolling over floor switches or knocking other Pokemon into holes. At the end each tower is a boss Pokemon, who is fought when they also trip on a pebble and start rolling. Boss arenas are small platforms surrounded by a bottomless pit. They must by rolled into and knocked into the abyss to be defeated.</plot>
