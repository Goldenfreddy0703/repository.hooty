        <emu_comment>Hacks are modified versions of old games. Some games get minor tweaks such as retranslations or simple gameplay improvements, others get complete overhauls that completely transform the original game. This is a list of just some of the Super Nintendo hacks available today.</emu_comment>

    <plot>For the past seven years, SMW Central has held a vanilla level design contest[CR]every spring. "Vanilla level design" refers to using only Lunar Magic to[CR]create your level - that is, no custom blocks, no custom sprites, and no[CR]custom code of any sort. They eventually began allowing people to use custom[CR]music, but this is not factored into their score. Once they finished designing[CR]their level, they would submit an IPS file, it would get judged + ranked, and[CR]that would be the end of it. This year, however, S.N.N. decided to assign[CR]resources (secondary exits, Map16 slots, etc) to users with the intention of[CR]putting all of their levels into a ROM and essentially creating a full hack[CR]out of it. The hack features 82 submitted entries and 4 switch palaces, which[CR]makes a grand total of 86 levels for you to beat. All of the levels are open[CR]from the start - you can play them in any order you'd like. To help you keep[CR]track of your progress, the game autosaves on the world map and beating a[CR]level will give you an "M" in the top right corner of the overworld. As a[CR]disclaimer, the levels are organized on the overworld by theme, and not by[CR]ranking. This means that the quality of the levels might fluctuate[CR]dramatically from one to the next (e.g. having a 70th place entry directly[CR]before a 12th place entry). The bottom 8 and top 8 each have their own world,[CR]however, so it's easy to distinguish them from the rest.[CR]Read[CR]Me:[CR]~~~Vanilla Level Design Contest 2014: SMW Centrals second collaboration[CR]hack.~~~[CR]*be sure to use the newest version of ZSNES, BSNES, SNES9X, etc.[CR]We cannot guarantee that this hack will run[CR]on archaic emulators that have[CR]not been updated since the stone age.[CR]Thanks!*[CR]=============================[CR]BRIEF DESCRIPTION AND[CR]HISTORY[CR]=============================[CR]~From the desk of S.N.N.~[CR]For[CR]the past seven years, SMW Central has held a vanilla level design contest[CR]every spring. "Vanilla level design" refers to using only Lunar Magic to[CR]create your level - that is, no custom blocks, no custom sprites, and no[CR]custom code of any sort. We eventually began allowing people to use custom[CR]music since, truthfully, weve all gotten a bit sick of the original five or[CR]six tracks SMW offered, but this is not factored into their score. Once they[CR]finished designing their level, they would submit an IPS file, it would get[CR]judged + ranked, and that would be the end of it.[CR]This year, however, I[CR]decided to assign resources (secondary exits, Map16 slots, etc) to users with[CR]the intention of putting all of their levels into a ROM and essentially[CR]creating a full hack out of it. The fact that youre reading this right now[CR]means that this was a resounding success - nearly everyone followed my[CR]instructions, and as such weve ended up with SMWCs second completed[CR]collaboration hack ever![CR]The hack features 82 submitted entries and 4[CR]switch palaces, which makes a grand total of 86 levels for you to beat. All of[CR]the levels are open from the start - you can play them in any order youd like.[CR]To help you keep track of your progress, the game autosaves on the world map[CR]and beating a level will give you an "M" in the top right corner of the[CR]overworld. As a disclaimer, I should note that the levels are organized on the[CR]overworld by theme, and not by ranking. This means that the quality of the[CR]levels my fluctuate dramatically from one to the next (e.g. having a 70th[CR]place entry directly before a 12th place entry).

Nobody is certain[CR]how it got there, and nobody is certain what it contains. People claim they[CR]have seen it in Lunar Magic - "level 150", they said. "Its black and white",[CR]they said, but these are all illusions. People have tried to cheat their way[CR]in, but doing so has resulted in the demise of their ROM.

    <plot>A collaboration hack made by the Talkhaus community in the style of the VIP[CR]and Wall Mix series.It has ASM, graphics, level, sound, and music changes. It[CR]is a very strange hack compared to many of the usual ones but it is much worth[CR]taking a look at. Enjoy! NOTE - May have issues with Snes9X, may want to use[CR]ZSNES for more flawless play.</plot>

    <plot>This is the sequel to Mario's Strange Quest. Picking up where Mario's Strange[CR]Quest left off, it turns out that the part where Yoshi's eggs hatched at the[CR]end of MSQ didn't actually happen. What really happened after Mario beat[CR]Bowser, rescued Yoshi's eggs, and saved the princess was that Yoshi and his[CR]sleepy friend decided to move to a new land so that he can protect his eggs[CR]from Bowser before they really hatched. So, both Yoshis do so and they find[CR]themselves in the land of Weirdonia. However, it seems that Bowser apparently[CR]insists on stealing Yoshi's eggs, since Yoshi's eggs were stolen again while[CR]Yoshi was out shopping. Since Mario isn't around to help this time, Yoshi goes[CR]on a quest by himself to retrieve his eggs. However, just like Mario's Strange[CR]Quest, this isn't your ordinary quest. The land of Weirdonia is a strange land[CR]filled with bizarre gimmicks, weird themes, and possibly jelly filled donuts[CR]and pizza. Expect the unexpected during Yoshi's journey. This hack's features:[CR]* 71 levels (100 exits) * Custom Graphics * Tested on and works on a real SNES[CR]* Custom Music * Custom ASM * Lots of level variety * Plenty of (possibly)[CR]unique gimmicks and themes * Lots of silliness and general weirdness * A box[CR]art image, a cartridge sticker image, and a game manual (download links are in[CR]the readme) * Older versions of YSQ (V1.0, V1.1, V1.2, and V1.3 Beta) are[CR]linked to in the readme for those that are interested in seeing what YSQ was[CR]like in past versions * Lots of secrets to find * Free novelty T-shirts with[CR]every download* * T-shirt not included.[CR]Read Me:[CR]Yoshis Strange[CR]Quest V1.3 - Yoshifanatic (aka yoshifanatic1, BiggestYoshifan)[CR]====Story[CR]Summery====[CR]This is the sequel to Marios Strange Quest. Picking up where[CR]Marios Strange Quest left off, it turns out that the part where Yoshis eggs[CR]hatched at the end of MSQ didnt actually happen. What really happened after[CR]Mario beat Bowser, rescued Yoshis eggs, and saved the princess was that Yoshi[CR]and his sleepy friend decided to move to a new land so that he can protect his[CR]eggs from Bowser before they really hatched.

The land of Weirdonia is[CR]a strange land filled with bizarre gimmicks, weird themes, and possibly jelly[CR]filled donuts and pizza. Expect the unexpected during Yoshis[CR]journey.[CR]====YSQs features====[CR]- 71 levels (100 exits)[CR]- Custom[CR]Graphics[CR]- Tested on a real SNES[CR]- Custom Music[CR]- Custom ASM[CR]-[CR]Lots of level variety[CR]- Plenty of (possibly) unique gimmicks and[CR]themes[CR]- Extraneous artwork done specifically for this hack, such as a box[CR]art image. You can find the general artwork here:[CR]http://biggestyoshifan.deviantart.com/gallery/33006643 and the drawings for[CR]the scenario rooms here:[CR]http://biggestyoshifan.deviantart.com/gallery/39779130. Note: Yoshifanatic[CR]plans on doing more YSQ art in the future.[CR]- Lots of silliness and general[CR]weirdness[CR]- A box art image, a cartridge sticker image, and a game manual,[CR]since real SNES games come with these things[CR]- Older versions of YSQ (V1.0,[CR]V1.1, V1.2, and V1.3 Beta) are linked to in the readme for those that are[CR]interested in seeing what YSQ was like in past versions[CR]- Lots of secrets[CR]to find[CR]- Free novelty T-shirts with every download*[CR]*T-shirt not[CR]included.[CR]====Controls====[CR]Since the player plays as Yoshi, Yoshi has[CR]some moves that Mario cant do (either because Yoshi is a Yoshi or because of[CR]the advancement of technology and game design (or something like that)). You[CR]will need to master these unique moves if you want to help Yoshi retrieve his[CR]stolen eggs![CR]A button - Aim eggs, Throw Eggs.[CR]B button (in midair) -[CR]Flutter Jump (press B in midair again to do another Flutter Jump)[CR]X button[CR]- Stick out tongue, spit out whatever is in Yoshis mouth[CR]Y button - Stick[CR]out tongue, spit out whatever is in Yoshis mouth[CR]Up + X or Y - Stick out[CR]tongue (upwards), spit out whatever is in Yoshis mouth (upwards) [CR]Down (in[CR]midair) - Ground Pound[CR]Up (holding it while aiming an egg) - Aim the egg[CR]straight up[CR]Up (while standing next to someone) - Talk to certain NPCs[CR]R button (while in level) - lock/unlock targeting cursor when aiming an[CR]egg[CR]R button (while on overworld) - Toggle between Hasty and Patient egg[CR]throwing styles[CR]L button (while on overworld) - Bring up save[CR]prompt[CR]Down (while aiming an egg) - cancel aiming an egg[CR]Select (while[CR]on Overworld) - Bring up the status screen[CR]Start (while a dialogue box is[CR]on screen) - Close dialogue box (Note: Some dialogue boxes cant be closed by[CR]pressing start)[CR]Yoshi also possesses all the moves Mario has in the[CR]original SMW, except spin jumping, throwing fireballs, and flying with a[CR]cape.[CR]====Notes====[CR]- Press the L button while on the overworld to bring[CR]up the save prompt, so you can save your game.[CR]- Unlike Mario, Yoshi cant[CR]spin Jump. The ground pound replaces the spin jump, though there are some[CR]things it cant do (like jumping off spiked enemies).[CR]- Yoshi always runs.[CR]No need to hold the X or Y buttons to run.[CR]- The counter on the lower left[CR]corner of the screen is your health counter. Every time Yoshi is hurt, this[CR]counter decreases by five. If the counter goes below 0, Yoshi will lose a[CR]life. Collect green coins (or stars that red eggs create when they hit an[CR]enemy) to refill the counter. Yoshi can have a maximum of 30 HP at once,[CR]allowing him to take up to 7 hits before dying (on normal mode, at[CR]least...).[CR]- Speaking of green coins, you can collect them by either[CR]touching them, tossing an egg at them, or by hitting them with a shell.[CR]-[CR]Yoshi is unable to grab most things with his hands. Instead, you must grab[CR]items, like springboards and shells with Yoshis tongue.[CR]- You can acquire[CR]eggs by eating enemies (though some cant be eaten, like Piranha Plants), and[CR]some cant be swallowed (like Koopa Shells) or picking them up off the ground[CR](either out in the open, from an egg plant, or from a green spotted[CR]block).[CR]- Yoshi can use three different kinds of eggs. Green eggs have no[CR]special properties. Yellow eggs create a coin when they hit an enemy. Red eggs[CR]create two stars that give Yoshi 1 HP each. [CR]- Whenever Yoshi gets an egg[CR]from one of the above methods, it will start to follow Yoshi from behind. This[CR]is how you can tell how many eggs Yoshi has. He can have up to six eggs[CR]following him at once.[CR]- If you see cracked looking rocks, you can break[CR]them with ground pounds, throwing eggs at them, or hitting them from[CR]below.[CR]- Yoshi loves green watermelons. Collect one of a 1-up.[CR]-[CR]Whenever you press the R button while on the overworld, youll change Yoshis[CR]egg throwing style, which is determined by what sound you hear when you press[CR]the button. If you hear a fireball throwing sound, you switched it to "Hasty",[CR]but if you hear a coin sound, then you switched it to "Patient". With Patient,[CR]you have to press the A button twice to throw an egg; once to aim the egg,[CR]then again to throw. With Hasty, you have to press and hold the A button to[CR]aim, then release the A button to throw.[CR]- With flutter jumping, it can be[CR]tricky to do at first. Heres how to do it properly. Whenever Yoshi finishes[CR]his current flutter jump, there is a short delay before he can do another[CR]flutter jump. Press and hold the jump button during this delay to ensure that[CR]Yoshi will flutter jump again once this delay is over. Practice this timing[CR]and youll eventually be able to flutter jump like a pro.[CR]- Experiment with[CR]how long you let Yoshi do a flutter jump for. There are various obstacles that[CR]can only be overcome by flutter jumping a certain way, such as using that[CR]slight boost Yoshi gets from the flutter jump to get around obstacles in areas[CR]where the ceiling is too low, or cancelling flutter jumps repeatedly to slow[CR]Yoshis fall.[CR]- If youve ever played Yoshis Island before, then you should[CR]know that many of the strategies and tricks you used in that game will work in[CR]this game. However, some things work slightly different from YI, such as the[CR]flutter jumping, so keep that in mind.[CR]- Some levels disable some of Yoshis[CR]abilities, though its usually justified in some way (ex. Yoshi enters an area[CR]that is very gross, causing him to lose his appetite, meaning Yoshi wont be[CR]able to use his tongue).[CR]- Some characters that Yoshi encounters on his[CR]journey can be talked to by pressing up. Not everyone will want to talk to[CR]you, though.[CR]- Every level, except for Yoshis House, has a set of invisible[CR]1-up checkpoints that will give you a 1-up if you find them. These are usually[CR]found in seemingly empty spots or in places that youll most likely not go to[CR]normally. Youre not required to find these for 100% completion (though if this[CR]game had achievements, this would probably be one of them), theyre just an[CR]optional little secret for you to find, much like bonus rooms, scenario rooms,[CR]or error message rooms.[CR]- Yoshi is a bit out of shape, thus he has a harder[CR]time flutter jumping compared to the average Yoshi. He cant get a boost from[CR]it at the peak of his jump, it can take him a while to rise up if he has a lot[CR]of downwards momentum, and since he has to make such an effort and focus to[CR]stay airborne, he loses his focus if he hits his head on the ceiling,[CR]requiring you to hit the button again to continue flutter jumping.[CR]- You[CR]can re-enter destroyed switch palaces, castles, and fortresses the same way[CR]you normally enter levels.[CR]- The L and R buttons are handy for those[CR]situations where you want to see farther ahead, such as a wide pit that you[CR]cant see the other side of when youre in the middle of the screen or to spot[CR]an enemy that may be a problem during a jump. You can also use Yoshis flutter[CR]jump in a similar way, where you can jump to the side, then flutter jump back[CR]to the ledge you jumped from in order to scout out whats ahead before doing a[CR]tricky section.[CR]- Sometimes, youll need to think outside the box to get[CR]past something, to solve a puzzle, or to find a secret exit.[CR]- Take your[CR]time when playing YSQ. YSQs levels are generally designed in a way where[CR]rushing through them will likely result in Yoshi dying. With the exception of[CR]auto scrolling levels or the rare area with a time limit, most areas in YSQ[CR]have no time limit, so you have plenty of time to think things through about[CR]the current obstacle or puzzle before doing it.[CR]- In order to advance[CR]beyond Yoshis New Home at the start of the game, you must enter it twice[CR](once, right after the intro and again after youve completed Yoshis New House[CR]and you returned to the overworld). Then, you must exit out of Yoshis New Home[CR]via side exits to go to the next level. If you think you are stuck on the[CR]overworld after beating Yoshis New House once, then it is obvious that you[CR]didnt even read this readme.[CR]- If youre an LPer who did a Lets Play of an[CR]older version of YSQ and are planning on LPing the newest version, I recommend[CR]that still show everything again. So much has changed in V1.3 over V1.2, even[CR]the stages that look almost the same as before may have a few new surprises or[CR]interesting changes.[CR]====Special Stuff====[CR]- Outside materials:[CR]I[CR]made some extra materials for YSQ that should be in this .zip folder, since I[CR]wanted YSQ to feel more like a real SNES game and because I wanted YSQ to[CR]stand out among other SMW hacks. The .zip folder for this hack contains,[CR]besides the patch/game and this readme:[CR]1). A box art drawing, which is a[CR]drawing I did myself that shows what the cover of the box might look like if[CR]YSQ actually came in a box.[CR]Download Link:[CR]https://www.dropbox.com/s/1dig87wozi6fq87/YSQ%20Box%20Art.png?dl=0[CR]2). A[CR]cartridge sticker image, which is meant to show what the cartridge sticker[CR]would look like. If you have a SNES flash cart or you are hardcore enough to[CR]actually put this game on a real SNES cartridge, you could print out this[CR]image and put it on the cartridge to make it feel more like YSQ is an actual[CR]SNES game. If you actually do this, then the dimensions of the sticker are:[CR]Width = 3.25 inches, Height = 1.75 inches (which is about 7.5% of the size of[CR]the image). In addition, you should fold the image about 0.25 inches from the[CR]top (which is where the top of the fat red line is at) as well as round out[CR]the corners. If you want to print it out, one way of doing so would be to open[CR]up Microsoft Word (if you have it), importing the sticker image into MS Word,[CR]shrinking the image to half its size in MS Word, setting the page size to 3.25[CR]in. X 1.75 in., then printing it out. What you print out should be about the[CR]correct size, and its quality should be about the same as it was in MS[CR]Word.[CR]Download Link:[CR]https://www.dropbox.com/s/32n2hpup6lfstca/YSQ%20Cartridge%20Sticker.png?dl=0[CR]3).[CR]A game manual, which is written in a way youd expect a game manual to be[CR]written. As in, it doesnt assume that youve played SMW before like this readme[CR]does. The reason that this readme is still included is because there might be[CR]some people who cant open .pdf files and this readme mentions things that[CR]would be kind of odd to mention in the manual, like the version history and[CR]glitches.[CR]Download Link:[CR]https://www.dropbox.com/s/vy0mp9diu0hgbqs/YSQ%20Manual.pdf?dl=0[CR]- Scenario[CR]rooms[CR]Throughout the land of Weirdonia are what are called "Scenario Rooms"[CR]where the player is presented with a situation involving Yoshi in some way,[CR]and the player must pick from three choices, which represent what Yoshi can do[CR]for that given scenario. The choice you make in each one of these rooms[CR]determines what reward you get. Can you find all 10 of them?[CR]- Yoshi[CR]Coins[CR]Every level in YSQ has 5 Yoshi coins for you to collect. Each one is[CR]worth 20 coins, and if you collect all 5 in a level, youll get an extra life.[CR]If you can collect every Yoshi coin in the game, then youll be rewarded in[CR]some way that Im going to keep a secret...[CR]If you can do it without using[CR]cheats, savestates, rewinds, etc. (which I imagine is not how most people are[CR]going to do this. I dare you to prove me wrong), then you deserve some kind of[CR]medal for your amazing platforming skills![CR]Note: If you die before[CR]collecting all 5 Yoshi coins, then youll lose the Yoshi coins you collected in[CR]that level, so be careful![CR]- Status Screen[CR]Pressing start while youre on[CR]the overworld will bring up a status screen that keeps track of your progress[CR]through YSQ. This screen will tell you what levels youve been to, which exits[CR]youve triggered for those levels, and whether or not you got all 5 Yoshi coins[CR]in any level that has them. If you get 100% exits, then you can also use the[CR]status screen to warp to any level on the overworld at will, and if you get[CR]100% of all the Yoshi coins, a Yoshi coin will appear on the status screen to[CR]indicate that you found them all (Note: This isnt the reward I mentioned in[CR]the Yoshi Coins entry above. Please dont send me angry messages about how you[CR]spent so much time and had so much trouble trying to get all the Yoshi coins[CR]and then thinking that the reward was just a Yoshi coin icon on the status[CR]screen. If you do this, then I have permission to laugh at you for not reading[CR]the readme. Dont give me a reason to laugh at you!)[CR]- Hard mode[CR]Whenever[CR]you go to select a file, you will have the option of selecting the difficulty[CR]level of YSQ. Normal mode is the standard difficulty, while Hard mode brings[CR]back the difficulty that V1.2 of YSQ had. Enabling hard mode will do the[CR]following:[CR]1). Doubles Yoshis knockback when he gets hit, up to V1.2[CR]levels.[CR]2). Increases the damage Yoshi takes from 5 to 10.[CR]3). Caps the[CR]maximum health Yoshi can have to 20 instead of 30.[CR]4). Midpoint tapes[CR]become useless (theyll still be present; they just wont do anything)[CR]5).[CR]Starts you off with 2 lives instead of 5.[CR] [CR]Are you hardcore enough to[CR]100% the game in hard mode, especially without using cheats, savestates,[CR]rewinds, etc.?[CR]- Boss Rush[CR]If you get 100% of all the exits, this option[CR]will become available by hitting the green block in Yoshis house. How fast you[CR]can beat each of the bosses in YSQ?[CR]- Secret music house[CR]Once you beat a[CR]certain level, this will become available to you by hitting the note block in[CR]Yoshis house. Listen to all the songs in the game from the many talented music[CR]porters who did them.[CR]- Error message rooms[CR]These are simply rooms that[CR]either are caused by the player failing in an impossible or silly way, or they[CR]are rooms that Yoshifanatic forgot to test while he was making this hack, and[CR]thus, they decided to glitch out in bizarre ways while he wasnt looking. Can[CR]you find all 10 of these strange rooms?[CR]- Replaying the Switch[CR]Palaces[CR]Once youve beaten a switch palace, youll be able to re-enter it[CR]just like any other level. Beating a switch palace a second time nets you a[CR]reward and is also required to get all Yoshi coins in each switch palace.[CR]-[CR]The pink, red and yellow ? blocks in Yoshis house.[CR]What do these do? Im not[CR]telling. If you reach certain points in YSQ, youll unlock whatever function[CR]these blocks serve.[CR]====Version History====[CR]Updates in V1.0[CR](https://www.dropbox.com/s/p1hhvkggu5kzskp/YSQV1.0.zip?dl=0)[CR]- What[CR]updates? This is the original version of YSQ.[CR]Updates in V1.1[CR](https://www.dropbox.com/s/611etotv3lbhptg/YSQV1.1.zip?dl=0)[CR]- There are[CR]three times more levels than in V1.0.[CR]- I changed the song that plays in a[CR]few of the levels, as well as the song that plays on the cave submap on the[CR]overworld.[CR]- Two of the Switch Palaces are now different colors.[CR]- Some[CR]of the levels in world one have been moved somewhere else on the[CR]overworld.[CR]- Some of the levels that were in V1.0 have a few secrets added[CR]to them. [CR]- The load times are a little shorter (not that they were long to[CR]begin with).[CR]- During some cutscenes, I made it so that all sprite graphics[CR]are invisible, in order to prevent the player from seeing stuff thats not[CR]supposed to be visible.[CR]- A couple of messages were added or changed[CR]slightly.[CR]- One of the overworld paths was changed, because it caused[CR]Yoshis position to be wrong on the overworld.[CR]- I changed the graphics for[CR]most of the food items to make them look better.[CR]- There are various minor[CR]improvements that dont really need to be listed individually.[CR]Updates in[CR]V1.2 (https://www.dropbox.com/s/55hx3gfapwifxx5/YSQV1.2.zip?dl=0)[CR]- The[CR]custom ASM has far fewer glitches with it, and has a few extra features.[CR]-[CR]Many of the levels have been changed slightly to work better with the fixed[CR]ASM[CR]- Midpoints have been added to many levels [CR]- I added an extra[CR]cutscene to one of the levels.[CR]- A few more songs have been added to the[CR]game.[CR]- I changed the "Yoshi Presents" sprite so that it looks completely[CR]different from the original "Nintendo Presents" sprite.[CR]- I added a Credits[CR]sequence to the end of demo level[CR]- When you enter a level, it now says[CR]"Yoshi Start!" instead of nothing.[CR]- I fixed a glitch in Misty Mine, so[CR]that you wont be forced to die if you press down while in a barrel cannon.[CR]However, this means that you can no longer shoot straight down in them (not[CR]that you have to shoot in that direction, anyway)[CR]- I made several minor[CR]adjustments that arent worth mentioning.[CR]Updates in V1.3 Beta[CR](https://www.dropbox.com/s/1wr5bflw61e0xc0/YSQ%20V1.3Beta.zip?dl=0)[CR]- There[CR]are twice as many levels as there were in V1.2, and several old levels have[CR]been lengthened or changed in some way.[CR]- The game has been made easier in[CR]general, at least during normal mode...[CR]- A new difficulty level has been[CR]added, which is hard.[CR]- A status screen has been added to the overworld, so[CR]you can keep track of your progress throughout the game.[CR]- Midpoints have[CR]been added to most levels that didnt have them before.[CR]- Many more songs[CR]have been added to YSQ. This includes a new death and game over theme, as well[CR]as a victory theme when you complete a level.[CR]- Some areas now play[CR]different music, such as the title screen.[CR]- Layer 3 water is now[CR]transparent.[CR]- The blue bars that are a part of the water effect HDMA used[CR]in some levels are no longer there, in order to fix a glitch where those bars[CR]would appear for a second while transitioning to another level.[CR]- I fixed a[CR]serious bug where, if you are playing YSQ in BSNES Accuracy mode or on a real[CR]SNES, certain message spites might not display the message they were supposed[CR]to.[CR]- A few levels have been moved elsewhere on the overworld, merged with[CR]another level, or had their level design changed.[CR]- I fixed a lot of bugs[CR]with the Yoshi Player patch, such as the glitch where the green coins didnt[CR]always give you health when picked up, the glitch where Yoshis tongue would[CR]get stopped by or stuck on certain things for no reason, the glitch where[CR]Yoshi can continue ground pounding through spiked enemies, etc.[CR]- Ive made[CR]various graphical and palette edits to improve the graphics.[CR]- I fixed the[CR]glitches with certain custom sprites, like the barrel cannon, the soda bottle,[CR]and the World 2 boss.[CR]- The two known cases where a static sound would play[CR]at the start of a song have been fixed.[CR]- Ive switched to a new message[CR]format that enhances all the text in this hack immensely. Every scenario room[CR]and most of the cutscenes are now in this format.[CR]- You can no longer see[CR]what Yoshi is thinking about during the castle cutscenes, due to the new way[CR]the cutscenes are presented. However, most of the things Yoshi was thinking[CR]about during those cutscenes are now a part of his dialogue in those[CR]cutscenes.[CR]- Yoshis New Home now serves as a hub, where you can access[CR]various stuff. More stuff is unlocked as you progress in the hack.[CR]- The[CR]intro gives more details about the story, and it is now an actual level.[CR]-[CR]Ive written a tutorial, which is accessed from Yoshis New Home, telling you[CR]how Yoshis unique moves work.[CR]- The switch palace room in Yoshis New Home[CR]has been dummied out, because switch palaces can now be re-entered from the[CR]overworld[CR]- You can now save the game at any time by pressing the L button[CR]on the overworld.[CR]- A few extra features have been added to the Yoshi[CR]Player patch, such as randomized idle animations and the patient/hasty egg[CR]throwing style setting.[CR]- Some levels now have a parallax scrolling HDMA[CR]effect.[CR]- Most underwater areas now have a blue (or another color in some[CR]cases) tint to them, to make those areas look more like they are[CR]underwater.[CR]- The Yoshis in Yoshi Woods have more animations and you can[CR]now talk to them.[CR]- Bonus rooms have been added to a few more levels.[CR]-[CR]I fixed a strange glitch where Yoshi would sometimes start at the midpoint of[CR]levels hed never been to before, particularly S.S.Sunk.[CR]- The P-switch[CR]theme has been removed, in order to fix a few music glitches caused by having[CR]sampled death and victory themes.[CR]Updates in V1.3 (Find it on SMWCentrals[CR]hack section)[CR]- Balanced the difficulty better so certain really hard[CR]sections are easier.[CR]- Custom Layer 3 images have been added to some areas[CR]to make them look nicer.[CR]- Cyan Yoshi and Aero have been added to the[CR]game.[CR]- Reworded a few parts of some messages to make certain things[CR]clearer to the player.[CR]- Removed the layer 2 smashers and lava from the[CR]World 6 bosss arena and redesigned it to make up for that change. This was[CR]done to reduce slowdown.[CR]- Potentially fixed a bug where the game freezes[CR]after completing the puzzle in the world 6 castle on rare occasions (Not sure[CR]if this is truly fixed because I couldnt replicate it after one of my beta[CR]testers reported it).[CR]- Modified the health counter number graphics to make[CR]them easier to see in some areas.[CR]- Added idle animations to the few[CR]characters that were lacking one and gave one of those characters dialog if[CR]you decide to talk to him.[CR]- Fixed a bunch of typos in various[CR]messages.[CR]- Added the names of the people who helped beta test YSQ to the[CR]credits.[CR]- Added a few anti-cheat measures to prevent cheating (only a few.[CR]Most of the ones you may encounter are actually unintentional, as a side[CR]effect to the way YSQ was designed and how YSQ changes SMWs engine).[CR]-[CR]Removed the ? clouds because they refuse to work half the time, and I have[CR]absolutely no idea how to fix them.[CR]- Made a bunch of minor changes and bug[CR]fixes that arent too major.[CR]====Glitches====[CR]- There are possibly some[CR]spots where, depending on how many eggs Yoshi has following him, the game may[CR]slow down. It was very hard to avoid that at times, but at least it wont last[CR]too long if it does happen.[CR]- Some levels may have some minor sound[CR]glitches in them, due to the use of sample banks, echo, or AddmusicK.[CR]-[CR]Some doors/pipes/teleport blocks take the game a bit longer to load the level[CR]they take you to. This is not really a glitch (as its intentional, so that[CR]layer 2 in certain levels is placed right), but I figured Id mention[CR]this.[CR]- In some places, I used layer 3 in a level that has a message box.[CR]However, layer 3 does come back after the message ends, so this isnt really an[CR]issue.[CR]- Any time the game switches between songs (with one or two[CR]exceptions) there is a one second pause. In addition, sometimes the status bar[CR]will be in a different position during that one second on occasion. This is[CR]more of a limitation of the new music engine introduced with AddmusicK than a[CR]glitch, but I should mention this anyway. Besides, this lets me switch the[CR]sample bank mid-level for the songs that use a different sample bank than the[CR]one currently loaded, since the sample banks are loaded with the song, rather[CR]than loaded with the level.[CR]- You can only cancel a dialogue box when text[CR]is being drawn in the text box, not when its waiting for you to press A or[CR]when its paused for a bit.[CR]- In reverse gravity (aka when Yoshi is upside[CR]down relative to the enemies), Yoshi is unable to stick his tongue out and egg[CR]aiming is reversed (so, holding up will result in Yoshi aiming down).[CR]-[CR]Every once in a while when you bring up the status screen, the game might get[CR]stuck on the black screen, which I have absolutely no idea why this happens.[CR]If this happens, youll need to reset the game. I HIGHLY urge you to save your[CR]game before bringing up the status screen just in case so you dont lose any[CR]progress (thankfully, YSQ saves more things than just the events youve[CR]triggered. It also saves things like your coin count, lives, which levels you[CR]got every Yoshi coin in, etc, so its almost like loading a savestate when you[CR]reload the game normally).[CR]- YSQ made quite a few changes to SMWs engine[CR]and has so much stuff crammed into 4 MB of space, that I wouldnt be surprised[CR]if a few strange bugs pop up if you use cheats or try to modify YSQ in Lunar[CR]Magic, even if you use Version 2.30. Do not modify YSQ or use cheats, or else[CR]you may screw something up![CR]====QPMAMASPTIWAHFYC (Questions People Might[CR]Ask Me At Some Point That I Will Answer Here For Your Convenience)====[CR]- Q:[CR]"What do I need to do to start playing your hack?"[CR] [CR] A: First, go[CR]download a patching program that lets you patch an IPS patch to a ROM, such as[CR]Lunar IPS or FLIPS (you can find the former on the creator of Lunar Magics[CR]site (Fusoya) and the latter on SMWCentral.net. Alternatively, you can[CR]download the latest version of Lunar Magic which has the ability to apply an[CR]IPS patch to SMW. Next, go download a copy of the U.S. version of a headered[CR]SMW ROM (dont ask me where to find them though, cause I cant help you with[CR]that, though I will tell you that you should look for one with [!] in its name[CR]to ensure that you got a good copy, as well as [U], which means that its the[CR]U.S. version of SMW). Next, go download your SNES emulator of choice (or buy[CR]an SNES flash cart if you have an SNES and a lot of money) and start playing[CR]the game after you apply the IPS patch to the SMW ROM.[CR]- Q: "Why do most of[CR]the Yoshis in this game talk in third person?"[CR] A: That was something that[CR]I was inspired to do based on how Yoshi talked in the Super Mario World[CR]cartoon, which I thought was kind of cute. Fortunately, if you pay attention[CR]to the context of the Yoshis dialog, it shouldnt be too hard to tell if they[CR]are referring to themselves or others when they say Yoshi. As for the Yoshis[CR]that dont talk in third person, there actually is an in-game explanation for[CR]that if you talk to one of the Yoshis that doesnt speak in third person twice[CR](although the real life explanation for that would be that those Yoshis are[CR]either special cases or they are my friends characters, so they are going to[CR]talk the way they are supposed to talk).[CR]- Q: "Aaargghhh!! This jump/puzzle[CR]is impossible! How are you supposed to get past this?"[CR] A: Nothing is[CR]impossible in YSQ (assuming youre doing things correctly of course). This hack[CR]has been tested by me multiple times (both on a real SNES and an emulator) and[CR]by several others, so you should try to tackle the part youre struggling in[CR]YSQ in a different way (such as varying the way Yoshi is flutter jumping[CR]through an obstacle). If all else fails, search up a video of someone playing[CR]YSQ on that part and see how they got past it, or just message me and Ill help[CR]out.[CR]- Q: "Did you code a lot of this stuff yourself?"[CR] A: Most of the[CR]custom ASM in YSQ was done by others (for example, the Yoshi ASM that gives[CR]the player character all of Yoshis moves from Yoshis Island was done by[CR]Jimmy52905 on SMWCentral), so no. That said, there are some things I coded[CR]myself, mainly a few simple custom blocks, a couple simple sprites (like the[CR]Yoshi sprite on the lower right corner of the titlescreen), and one of the[CR]bosses. Plus, while the Yoshi ASM wasnt done by me, I did add a few extra[CR]things to it that were not in the ASM patch originally, such as the randomized[CR]idle animation, the patient/hasty egg throw option, and many bug fixes to[CR]it.[CR]- Q: "Can I use the graphics you used in YSQ?"[CR] A: Yes. Youre free[CR]to use whatever graphics you want in YSQ, except for the Yoshi OC sprites.[CR]Youll need my permission to use mine or my friends permission to use theirs.[CR]Also, I released a bunch of graphics I ripped/drew for YSQ already, so you[CR]ought to take a look at SMWCentrals graphics section to see if what you want[CR]to use has been released (the advantage of this being that I made those[CR]graphics submissions are easier to use than if you were to take them out of[CR]YSQ, since YSQs ExGFX and Map16 organization is haphazard at best).[CR]- Q: "I[CR]cant find this secret exit. Where is it?"[CR] A: Quite a few of the secret[CR]exits in YSQ are pretty deviously hidden, so dont give up if you cant seem to[CR]find it. If all else fails, go watch a video of someone playing that level you[CR]cant find the secret exit in, or just message me and Ill help out.[CR]- Q:[CR]"What is the point of the Yoshi coins?"[CR] A: They are meant to be a[CR]challenge for those that want to 100% YSQ. Plus, there is a reward for finding[CR]them all, but its a secret.[CR]- Q: "Can I use YSQ as a base for my hack?"[CR]A: Id be ok with that, but I highly dont recommend it. Youd potentially[CR]encounter lots of glitches due to the ASM changes Ive done to YSQ, and youd[CR]have absolutely no idea what most of those changes even are or where I applied[CR]them. All in all, its not worth it.[CR]- Q: "What is the meaning of[CR]life?"[CR]- A: That question has nothing to do with YSQ, but Ill answer it[CR]anyway. The meaning of life is to put meaning into your[CR]life.[CR]====Misc.====[CR]- If you have any comments about this hack, post[CR]them in the "Yoshis Strange Quest" thread on Super Mario World Central or[CR]message him on any of the sites he has an account on (besides the SMWiki). You[CR]can find him at these places:[CR] - SMWCentral (Yoshifanatic):[CR]http://www.smwcentral.net/?p=profile&amp;id;=13743[CR] - Youtube (yoshifanatic1):[CR]http://www.youtube.com/user/Yoshifanatic1[CR] - deviantART (BiggestYoshifan):[CR]http://biggestyoshifan.deviantart.com/[CR] - FurAffinity (BiggestYoshifan):[CR]http://www.furaffinity.net/user/biggestyoshifan/[CR]- This is the final[CR]version of YSQ, unless I have to submit new version that fixes any glitches me[CR]or the playtesters didnt notice (particularly if they are major[CR]glitches).[CR]- Oh, and thanks for downloading my hack! Hope you enjoy it as[CR]much as I enjoyed making it! ^_^</plot>

    <plot>This is the sequel to Mario's Strange Quest. Picking up where Mario's Strange[CR]Quest left off, it turns out that the part where Yoshi's eggs hatched at the[CR]end of MSQ didn't actually happen. What really happened after Mario beat[CR]Bowser, rescued Yoshi's eggs, and saved the princess was that Yoshi and his[CR]sleepy friend decided to move to a new land so that he can protect his eggs[CR]from Bowser before they really hatched. So, both Yoshis do so and they find[CR]themselves in the land of Weirdonia. However, it seems that Bowser apparently[CR]insists on stealing Yoshi's eggs, since Yoshi's eggs were stolen again while[CR]Yoshi was out shopping. Since Mario isn't around to help this time, Yoshi goes[CR]on a quest by himself to retrieve his eggs. However, just like Mario's Strange[CR]Quest, this isn't your ordinary quest. The land of Weirdonia is a strange land[CR]filled with bizarre gimmicks, weird themes, and possibly jelly filled donuts[CR]and pizza. Expect the unexpected during Yoshi's journey. This hack's features:[CR]* 71 levels (100 exits) * Custom Graphics * Tested on and works on a real SNES[CR]* Custom Music * Custom ASM * Lots of level variety * Plenty of (possibly)[CR]unique gimmicks and themes * Lots of silliness and general weirdness * A box[CR]art image, a cartridge sticker image, and a game manual (download links are in[CR]the readme) * Older versions of YSQ (V1.0, V1.1, V1.2, and V1.3 Beta) are[CR]linked to in the readme for those that are interested in seeing what YSQ was[CR]like in past versions * Lots of secrets to find * Free novelty T-shirts with[CR]every download* * T-shirt not included.[CR]Read Me:[CR]Yoshis Strange[CR]Quest V1.3 - Yoshifanatic (aka yoshifanatic1, BiggestYoshifan)[CR]====Story[CR]Summery====[CR]This is the sequel to Marios Strange Quest.

Note: Yoshifanatic[CR]plans on doing more YSQ art in the future.[CR]- Lots of silliness and general[CR]weirdness[CR]- A box art image, a cartridge sticker image, and a game manual,[CR]since real SNES games come with these things[CR]- Older versions of YSQ (V1.0,[CR]V1.1, V1.2, and V1.3 Beta) are linked to in the readme for those that are[CR]interested in seeing what YSQ was like in past versions[CR]- Lots of secrets[CR]to find[CR]- Free novelty T-shirts with every download*[CR]*T-shirt not[CR]included.[CR]====Controls====[CR]Since the player plays as Yoshi, Yoshi has[CR]some moves that Mario cant do (either because Yoshi is a Yoshi or because of[CR]the advancement of technology and game design (or something like that)). You[CR]will need to master these unique moves if you want to help Yoshi retrieve his[CR]stolen eggs![CR]A button - Aim eggs, Throw Eggs.[CR]B button (in midair) -[CR]Flutter Jump (press B in midair again to do another Flutter Jump)[CR]X button[CR]- Stick out tongue, spit out whatever is in Yoshis mouth[CR]Y button - Stick[CR]out tongue, spit out whatever is in Yoshis mouth[CR]Up + X or Y - Stick out[CR]tongue (upwards), spit out whatever is in Yoshis mouth (upwards) [CR]Down (in[CR]midair) - Ground Pound[CR]Up (holding it while aiming an egg) - Aim the egg[CR]straight up[CR]Up (while standing next to someone) - Talk to certain NPCs[CR]R button (while in level) - lock/unlock targeting cursor when aiming an[CR]egg[CR]R button (while on overworld) - Toggle between Hasty and Patient egg[CR]throwing styles[CR]L button (while on overworld) - Bring up save[CR]prompt[CR]Down (while aiming an egg) - cancel aiming an egg[CR]Select (while[CR]on Overworld) - Bring up the status screen[CR]Start (while a dialogue box is[CR]on screen) - Close dialogue box (Note: Some dialogue boxes cant be closed by[CR]pressing start)[CR]Yoshi also possesses all the moves Mario has in the[CR]original SMW, except spin jumping, throwing fireballs, and flying with a[CR]cape.[CR]====Notes====[CR]- Press the L button while on the overworld to bring[CR]up the save prompt, so you can save your game.[CR]- Unlike Mario, Yoshi cant[CR]spin Jump. The ground pound replaces the spin jump, though there are some[CR]things it cant do (like jumping off spiked enemies).[CR]- Yoshi always runs.[CR]No need to hold the X or Y buttons to run.[CR]- The counter on the lower left[CR]corner of the screen is your health counter. Every time Yoshi is hurt, this[CR]counter decreases by five. If the counter goes below 0, Yoshi will lose a[CR]life. Collect green coins (or stars that red eggs create when they hit an[CR]enemy) to refill the counter. Yoshi can have a maximum of 30 HP at once,[CR]allowing him to take up to 7 hits before dying (on normal mode, at[CR]least...).[CR]- Speaking of green coins, you can collect them by either[CR]touching them, tossing an egg at them, or by hitting them with a shell.[CR]-[CR]Yoshi is unable to grab most things with his hands. Instead, you must grab[CR]items, like springboards and shells with Yoshis tongue.[CR]- You can acquire[CR]eggs by eating enemies (though some cant be eaten, like Piranha Plants), and[CR]some cant be swallowed (like Koopa Shells) or picking them up off the ground[CR](either out in the open, from an egg plant, or from a green spotted[CR]block).[CR]- Yoshi can use three different kinds of eggs. Green eggs have no[CR]special properties. Yellow eggs create a coin when they hit an enemy. Red eggs[CR]create two stars that give Yoshi 1 HP each. [CR]- Whenever Yoshi gets an egg[CR]from one of the above methods, it will start to follow Yoshi from behind. This[CR]is how you can tell how many eggs Yoshi has. He can have up to six eggs[CR]following him at once.[CR]- If you see cracked looking rocks, you can break[CR]them with ground pounds, throwing eggs at them, or hitting them from[CR]below.[CR]- Yoshi loves green watermelons. Collect one of a 1-up.[CR]-[CR]Whenever you press the R button while on the overworld, youll change Yoshis[CR]egg throwing style, which is determined by what sound you hear when you press[CR]the button. If you hear a fireball throwing sound, you switched it to "Hasty",[CR]but if you hear a coin sound, then you switched it to "Patient". With Patient,[CR]you have to press the A button twice to throw an egg; once to aim the egg,[CR]then again to throw. With Hasty, you have to press and hold the A button to[CR]aim, then release the A button to throw.[CR]- With flutter jumping, it can be[CR]tricky to do at first. Heres how to do it properly. Whenever Yoshi finishes[CR]his current flutter jump, there is a short delay before he can do another[CR]flutter jump. Press and hold the jump button during this delay to ensure that[CR]Yoshi will flutter jump again once this delay is over. Practice this timing[CR]and youll eventually be able to flutter jump like a pro.[CR]- Experiment with[CR]how long you let Yoshi do a flutter jump for. There are various obstacles that[CR]can only be overcome by flutter jumping a certain way, such as using that[CR]slight boost Yoshi gets from the flutter jump to get around obstacles in areas[CR]where the ceiling is too low, or cancelling flutter jumps repeatedly to slow[CR]Yoshis fall.[CR]- If youve ever played Yoshis Island before, then you should[CR]know that many of the strategies and tricks you used in that game will work in[CR]this game. However, some things work slightly different from YI, such as the[CR]flutter jumping, so keep that in mind.[CR]- Some levels disable some of Yoshis[CR]abilities, though its usually justified in some way (ex. Yoshi enters an area[CR]that is very gross, causing him to lose his appetite, meaning Yoshi wont be[CR]able to use his tongue).[CR]- Some characters that Yoshi encounters on his[CR]journey can be talked to by pressing up. Not everyone will want to talk to[CR]you, though.[CR]- Every level, except for Yoshis House, has a set of invisible[CR]1-up checkpoints that will give you a 1-up if you find them. These are usually[CR]found in seemingly empty spots or in places that youll most likely not go to[CR]normally. Youre not required to find these for 100% completion (though if this[CR]game had achievements, this would probably be one of them), theyre just an[CR]optional little secret for you to find, much like bonus rooms, scenario rooms,[CR]or error message rooms.[CR]- Yoshi is a bit out of shape, thus he has a harder[CR]time flutter jumping compared to the average Yoshi. He cant get a boost from[CR]it at the peak of his jump, it can take him a while to rise up if he has a lot[CR]of downwards momentum, and since he has to make such an effort and focus to[CR]stay airborne, he loses his focus if he hits his head on the ceiling,[CR]requiring you to hit the button again to continue flutter jumping.[CR]- You[CR]can re-enter destroyed switch palaces, castles, and fortresses the same way[CR]you normally enter levels.[CR]- The L and R buttons are handy for those[CR]situations where you want to see farther ahead, such as a wide pit that you[CR]cant see the other side of when youre in the middle of the screen or to spot[CR]an enemy that may be a problem during a jump. You can also use Yoshis flutter[CR]jump in a similar way, where you can jump to the side, then flutter jump back[CR]to the ledge you jumped from in order to scout out whats ahead before doing a[CR]tricky section.[CR]- Sometimes, youll need to think outside the box to get[CR]past something, to solve a puzzle, or to find a secret exit.[CR]- Take your[CR]time when playing YSQ. YSQs levels are generally designed in a way where[CR]rushing through them will likely result in Yoshi dying. With the exception of[CR]auto scrolling levels or the rare area with a time limit, most areas in YSQ[CR]have no time limit, so you have plenty of time to think things through about[CR]the current obstacle or puzzle before doing it.[CR]- In order to advance[CR]beyond Yoshis New Home at the start of the game, you must enter it twice[CR](once, right after the intro and again after youve completed Yoshis New House[CR]and you returned to the overworld). Then, you must exit out of Yoshis New Home[CR]via side exits to go to the next level. If you think you are stuck on the[CR]overworld after beating Yoshis New House once, then it is obvious that you[CR]didnt even read this readme.[CR]- If youre an LPer who did a Lets Play of an[CR]older version of YSQ and are planning on LPing the newest version, I recommend[CR]that still show everything again. So much has changed in V1.3 over V1.2, even[CR]the stages that look almost the same as before may have a few new surprises or[CR]interesting changes.[CR]====Special Stuff====[CR]- Outside materials:[CR]I[CR]made some extra materials for YSQ that should be in this .zip folder, since I[CR]wanted YSQ to feel more like a real SNES game and because I wanted YSQ to[CR]stand out among other SMW hacks. The .zip folder for this hack contains,[CR]besides the patch/game and this readme:[CR]1). A box art drawing, which is a[CR]drawing I did myself that shows what the cover of the box might look like if[CR]YSQ actually came in a box.[CR]Download Link:[CR]https://www.dropbox.com/s/1dig87wozi6fq87/YSQ%20Box%20Art.png?dl=0[CR]2). A[CR]cartridge sticker image, which is meant to show what the cartridge sticker[CR]would look like. If you have a SNES flash cart or you are hardcore enough to[CR]actually put this game on a real SNES cartridge, you could print out this[CR]image and put it on the cartridge to make it feel more like YSQ is an actual[CR]SNES game. If you actually do this, then the dimensions of the sticker are:[CR]Width = 3.25 inches, Height = 1.75 inches (which is about 7.5% of the size of[CR]the image). In addition, you should fold the image about 0.25 inches from the[CR]top (which is where the top of the fat red line is at) as well as round out[CR]the corners. If you want to print it out, one way of doing so would be to open[CR]up Microsoft Word (if you have it), importing the sticker image into MS Word,[CR]shrinking the image to half its size in MS Word, setting the page size to 3.25[CR]in. X 1.75 in., then printing it out. What you print out should be about the[CR]correct size, and its quality should be about the same as it was in MS[CR]Word.[CR]Download Link:[CR]https://www.dropbox.com/s/32n2hpup6lfstca/YSQ%20Cartridge%20Sticker.png?dl=0[CR]3).[CR]A game manual, which is written in a way youd expect a game manual to be[CR]written. As in, it doesnt assume that youve played SMW before like this readme[CR]does. The reason that this readme is still included is because there might be[CR]some people who cant open .pdf files and this readme mentions things that[CR]would be kind of odd to mention in the manual, like the version history and[CR]glitches.[CR]Download Link:[CR]https://www.dropbox.com/s/vy0mp9diu0hgbqs/YSQ%20Manual.pdf?dl=0[CR]- Scenario[CR]rooms[CR]Throughout the land of Weirdonia are what are called "Scenario Rooms"[CR]where the player is presented with a situation involving Yoshi in some way,[CR]and the player must pick from three choices, which represent what Yoshi can do[CR]for that given scenario. The choice you make in each one of these rooms[CR]determines what reward you get. Can you find all 10 of them?[CR]- Yoshi[CR]Coins[CR]Every level in YSQ has 5 Yoshi coins for you to collect. Each one is[CR]worth 20 coins, and if you collect all 5 in a level, youll get an extra life.[CR]If you can collect every Yoshi coin in the game, then youll be rewarded in[CR]some way that Im going to keep a secret...[CR]If you can do it without using[CR]cheats, savestates, rewinds, etc. (which I imagine is not how most people are[CR]going to do this. I dare you to prove me wrong), then you deserve some kind of[CR]medal for your amazing platforming skills![CR]Note: If you die before[CR]collecting all 5 Yoshi coins, then youll lose the Yoshi coins you collected in[CR]that level, so be careful![CR]- Status Screen[CR]Pressing start while youre on[CR]the overworld will bring up a status screen that keeps track of your progress[CR]through YSQ. This screen will tell you what levels youve been to, which exits[CR]youve triggered for those levels, and whether or not you got all 5 Yoshi coins[CR]in any level that has them. If you get 100% exits, then you can also use the[CR]status screen to warp to any level on the overworld at will, and if you get[CR]100% of all the Yoshi coins, a Yoshi coin will appear on the status screen to[CR]indicate that you found them all (Note: This isnt the reward I mentioned in[CR]the Yoshi Coins entry above. Please dont send me angry messages about how you[CR]spent so much time and had so much trouble trying to get all the Yoshi coins[CR]and then thinking that the reward was just a Yoshi coin icon on the status[CR]screen. If you do this, then I have permission to laugh at you for not reading[CR]the readme. Dont give me a reason to laugh at you!)[CR]- Hard mode[CR]Whenever[CR]you go to select a file, you will have the option of selecting the difficulty[CR]level of YSQ. Normal mode is the standard difficulty, while Hard mode brings[CR]back the difficulty that V1.2 of YSQ had. Enabling hard mode will do the[CR]following:[CR]1). Doubles Yoshis knockback when he gets hit, up to V1.2[CR]levels.[CR]2). Increases the damage Yoshi takes from 5 to 10.[CR]3). Caps the[CR]maximum health Yoshi can have to 20 instead of 30.[CR]4). Midpoint tapes[CR]become useless (theyll still be present; they just wont do anything)[CR]5).[CR]Starts you off with 2 lives instead of 5.[CR] [CR]Are you hardcore enough to[CR]100% the game in hard mode, especially without using cheats, savestates,[CR]rewinds, etc.?[CR]- Boss Rush[CR]If you get 100% of all the exits, this option[CR]will become available by hitting the green block in Yoshis house. How fast you[CR]can beat each of the bosses in YSQ?[CR]- Secret music house[CR]Once you beat a[CR]certain level, this will become available to you by hitting the note block in[CR]Yoshis house. Listen to all the songs in the game from the many talented music[CR]porters who did them.[CR]- Error message rooms[CR]These are simply rooms that[CR]either are caused by the player failing in an impossible or silly way, or they[CR]are rooms that Yoshifanatic forgot to test while he was making this hack, and[CR]thus, they decided to glitch out in bizarre ways while he wasnt looking. Can[CR]you find all 10 of these strange rooms?[CR]- Replaying the Switch[CR]Palaces[CR]Once youve beaten a switch palace, youll be able to re-enter it[CR]just like any other level. Beating a switch palace a second time nets you a[CR]reward and is also required to get all Yoshi coins in each switch palace.[CR]-[CR]The pink, red and yellow ? blocks in Yoshis house.[CR]What do these do? Im not[CR]telling. If you reach certain points in YSQ, youll unlock whatever function[CR]these blocks serve.[CR]====Version History====[CR]Updates in V1.0[CR](https://www.dropbox.com/s/p1hhvkggu5kzskp/YSQV1.0.zip?dl=0)[CR]- What[CR]updates? This is the original version of YSQ.[CR]Updates in V1.1[CR](https://www.dropbox.com/s/611etotv3lbhptg/YSQV1.1.zip?dl=0)[CR]- There are[CR]three times more levels than in V1.0.[CR]- I changed the song that plays in a[CR]few of the levels, as well as the song that plays on the cave submap on the[CR]overworld.[CR]- Two of the Switch Palaces are now different colors.[CR]- Some[CR]of the levels in world one have been moved somewhere else on the[CR]overworld.[CR]- Some of the levels that were in V1.0 have a few secrets added[CR]to them. [CR]- The load times are a little shorter (not that they were long to[CR]begin with).[CR]- During some cutscenes, I made it so that all sprite graphics[CR]are invisible, in order to prevent the player from seeing stuff thats not[CR]supposed to be visible.[CR]- A couple of messages were added or changed[CR]slightly.[CR]- One of the overworld paths was changed, because it caused[CR]Yoshis position to be wrong on the overworld.[CR]- I changed the graphics for[CR]most of the food items to make them look better.[CR]- There are various minor[CR]improvements that dont really need to be listed individually.[CR]Updates in[CR]V1.2 (https://www.dropbox.com/s/55hx3gfapwifxx5/YSQV1.2.zip?dl=0)[CR]- The[CR]custom ASM has far fewer glitches with it, and has a few extra features.[CR]-[CR]Many of the levels have been changed slightly to work better with the fixed[CR]ASM[CR]- Midpoints have been added to many levels [CR]- I added an extra[CR]cutscene to one of the levels.[CR]- A few more songs have been added to the[CR]game.[CR]- I changed the "Yoshi Presents" sprite so that it looks completely[CR]different from the original "Nintendo Presents" sprite.[CR]- I added a Credits[CR]sequence to the end of demo level[CR]- When you enter a level, it now says[CR]"Yoshi Start!" instead of nothing.[CR]- I fixed a glitch in Misty Mine, so[CR]that you wont be forced to die if you press down while in a barrel cannon.[CR]However, this means that you can no longer shoot straight down in them (not[CR]that you have to shoot in that direction, anyway)[CR]- I made several minor[CR]adjustments that arent worth mentioning.[CR]Updates in V1.3 Beta[CR](https://www.dropbox.com/s/1wr5bflw61e0xc0/YSQ%20V1.3Beta.zip?dl=0)[CR]- There[CR]are twice as many levels as there were in V1.2, and several old levels have[CR]been lengthened or changed in some way.[CR]- The game has been made easier in[CR]general, at least during normal mode...[CR]- A new difficulty level has been[CR]added, which is hard.[CR]- A status screen has been added to the overworld, so[CR]you can keep track of your progress throughout the game.[CR]- Midpoints have[CR]been added to most levels that didnt have them before.[CR]- Many more songs[CR]have been added to YSQ. This includes a new death and game over theme, as well[CR]as a victory theme when you complete a level.[CR]- Some areas now play[CR]different music, such as the title screen.[CR]- Layer 3 water is now[CR]transparent.[CR]- The blue bars that are a part of the water effect HDMA used[CR]in some levels are no longer there, in order to fix a glitch where those bars[CR]would appear for a second while transitioning to another level.[CR]- I fixed a[CR]serious bug where, if you are playing YSQ in BSNES Accuracy mode or on a real[CR]SNES, certain message spites might not display the message they were supposed[CR]to.[CR]- A few levels have been moved elsewhere on the overworld, merged with[CR]another level, or had their level design changed.[CR]- I fixed a lot of bugs[CR]with the Yoshi Player patch, such as the glitch where the green coins didnt[CR]always give you health when picked up, the glitch where Yoshis tongue would[CR]get stopped by or stuck on certain things for no reason, the glitch where[CR]Yoshi can continue ground pounding through spiked enemies, etc.[CR]- Ive made[CR]various graphical and palette edits to improve the graphics.[CR]- I fixed the[CR]glitches with certain custom sprites, like the barrel cannon, the soda bottle,[CR]and the World 2 boss.[CR]- The two known cases where a static sound would play[CR]at the start of a song have been fixed.[CR]- Ive switched to a new message[CR]format that enhances all the text in this hack immensely. Every scenario room[CR]and most of the cutscenes are now in this format.[CR]- You can no longer see[CR]what Yoshi is thinking about during the castle cutscenes, due to the new way[CR]the cutscenes are presented. However, most of the things Yoshi was thinking[CR]about during those cutscenes are now a part of his dialogue in those[CR]cutscenes.[CR]- Yoshis New Home now serves as a hub, where you can access[CR]various stuff. More stuff is unlocked as you progress in the hack.[CR]- The[CR]intro gives more details about the story, and it is now an actual level.[CR]-[CR]Ive written a tutorial, which is accessed from Yoshis New Home, telling you[CR]how Yoshis unique moves work.[CR]- The switch palace room in Yoshis New Home[CR]has been dummied out, because switch palaces can now be re-entered from the[CR]overworld[CR]- You can now save the game at any time by pressing the L button[CR]on the overworld.[CR]- A few extra features have been added to the Yoshi[CR]Player patch, such as randomized idle animations and the patient/hasty egg[CR]throwing style setting.[CR]- Some levels now have a parallax scrolling HDMA[CR]effect.[CR]- Most underwater areas now have a blue (or another color in some[CR]cases) tint to them, to make those areas look more like they are[CR]underwater.[CR]- The Yoshis in Yoshi Woods have more animations and you can[CR]now talk to them.[CR]- Bonus rooms have been added to a few more levels.[CR]-[CR]I fixed a strange glitch where Yoshi would sometimes start at the midpoint of[CR]levels hed never been to before, particularly S.S.Sunk.[CR]- The P-switch[CR]theme has been removed, in order to fix a few music glitches caused by having[CR]sampled death and victory themes.[CR]Updates in V1.3 (Find it on SMWCentrals[CR]hack section)[CR]- Balanced the difficulty better so certain really hard[CR]sections are easier.[CR]- Custom Layer 3 images have been added to some areas[CR]to make them look nicer.[CR]- Cyan Yoshi and Aero have been added to the[CR]game.[CR]- Reworded a few parts of some messages to make certain things[CR]clearer to the player.[CR]- Removed the layer 2 smashers and lava from the[CR]World 6 bosss arena and redesigned it to make up for that change. This was[CR]done to reduce slowdown.[CR]- Potentially fixed a bug where the game freezes[CR]after completing the puzzle in the world 6 castle on rare occasions (Not sure[CR]if this is truly fixed because I couldnt replicate it after one of my beta[CR]testers reported it).[CR]- Modified the health counter number graphics to make[CR]them easier to see in some areas.[CR]- Added idle animations to the few[CR]characters that were lacking one and gave one of those characters dialog if[CR]you decide to talk to him.[CR]- Fixed a bunch of typos in various[CR]messages.[CR]- Added the names of the people who helped beta test YSQ to the[CR]credits.[CR]- Added a few anti-cheat measures to prevent cheating (only a few.[CR]Most of the ones you may encounter are actually unintentional, as a side[CR]effect to the way YSQ was designed and how YSQ changes SMWs engine).[CR]-[CR]Removed the ? clouds because they refuse to work half the time, and I have[CR]absolutely no idea how to fix them.[CR]- Made a bunch of minor changes and bug[CR]fixes that arent too major.[CR]====Glitches====[CR]- There are possibly some[CR]spots where, depending on how many eggs Yoshi has following him, the game may[CR]slow down. It was very hard to avoid that at times, but at least it wont last[CR]too long if it does happen.[CR]- Some levels may have some minor sound[CR]glitches in them, due to the use of sample banks, echo, or AddmusicK.[CR]-[CR]Some doors/pipes/teleport blocks take the game a bit longer to load the level[CR]they take you to. This is not really a glitch (as its intentional, so that[CR]layer 2 in certain levels is placed right), but I figured Id mention[CR]this.[CR]- In some places, I used layer 3 in a level that has a message box.[CR]However, layer 3 does come back after the message ends, so this isnt really an[CR]issue.[CR]- Any time the game switches between songs (with one or two[CR]exceptions) there is a one second pause. In addition, sometimes the status bar[CR]will be in a different position during that one second on occasion. This is[CR]more of a limitation of the new music engine introduced with AddmusicK than a[CR]glitch, but I should mention this anyway. Besides, this lets me switch the[CR]sample bank mid-level for the songs that use a different sample bank than the[CR]one currently loaded, since the sample banks are loaded with the song, rather[CR]than loaded with the level.[CR]- You can only cancel a dialogue box when text[CR]is being drawn in the text box, not when its waiting for you to press A or[CR]when its paused for a bit.[CR]- In reverse gravity (aka when Yoshi is upside[CR]down relative to the enemies), Yoshi is unable to stick his tongue out and egg[CR]aiming is reversed (so, holding up will result in Yoshi aiming down).[CR]-[CR]Every once in a while when you bring up the status screen, the game might get[CR]stuck on the black screen, which I have absolutely no idea why this happens.[CR]If this happens, youll need to reset the game. I HIGHLY urge you to save your[CR]game before bringing up the status screen just in case so you dont lose any[CR]progress (thankfully, YSQ saves more things than just the events youve[CR]triggered. It also saves things like your coin count, lives, which levels you[CR]got every Yoshi coin in, etc, so its almost like loading a savestate when you[CR]reload the game normally).[CR]- YSQ made quite a few changes to SMWs engine[CR]and has so much stuff crammed into 4 MB of space, that I wouldnt be surprised[CR]if a few strange bugs pop up if you use cheats or try to modify YSQ in Lunar[CR]Magic, even if you use Version 2.30. Do not modify YSQ or use cheats, or else[CR]you may screw something up![CR]====QPMAMASPTIWAHFYC (Questions People Might[CR]Ask Me At Some Point That I Will Answer Here For Your Convenience)====[CR]- Q:[CR]"What do I need to do to start playing your hack?"[CR] [CR] A: First, go[CR]download a patching program that lets you patch an IPS patch to a ROM, such as[CR]Lunar IPS or FLIPS (you can find the former on the creator of Lunar Magics[CR]site (Fusoya) and the latter on SMWCentral.net. Alternatively, you can[CR]download the latest version of Lunar Magic which has the ability to apply an[CR]IPS patch to SMW. Next, go download a copy of the U.S. version of a headered[CR]SMW ROM (dont ask me where to find them though, cause I cant help you with[CR]that, though I will tell you that you should look for one with [!] in its name[CR]to ensure that you got a good copy, as well as [U], which means that its the[CR]U.S. version of SMW). Next, go download your SNES emulator of choice (or buy[CR]an SNES flash cart if you have an SNES and a lot of money) and start playing[CR]the game after you apply the IPS patch to the SMW ROM.[CR]- Q: "Why do most of[CR]the Yoshis in this game talk in third person?"[CR] A: That was something that[CR]I was inspired to do based on how Yoshi talked in the Super Mario World[CR]cartoon, which I thought was kind of cute. Fortunately, if you pay attention[CR]to the context of the Yoshis dialog, it shouldnt be too hard to tell if they[CR]are referring to themselves or others when they say Yoshi. As for the Yoshis[CR]that dont talk in third person, there actually is an in-game explanation for[CR]that if you talk to one of the Yoshis that doesnt speak in third person twice[CR](although the real life explanation for that would be that those Yoshis are[CR]either special cases or they are my friends characters, so they are going to[CR]talk the way they are supposed to talk).[CR]- Q: "Aaargghhh!! This jump/puzzle[CR]is impossible! How are you supposed to get past this?"[CR] A: Nothing is[CR]impossible in YSQ (assuming youre doing things correctly of course). This hack[CR]has been tested by me multiple times (both on a real SNES and an emulator) and[CR]by several others, so you should try to tackle the part youre struggling in[CR]YSQ in a different way (such as varying the way Yoshi is flutter jumping[CR]through an obstacle). If all else fails, search up a video of someone playing[CR]YSQ on that part and see how they got past it, or just message me and Ill help[CR]out.[CR]- Q: "Did you code a lot of this stuff yourself?"[CR] A: Most of the[CR]custom ASM in YSQ was done by others (for example, the Yoshi ASM that gives[CR]the player character all of Yoshis moves from Yoshis Island was done by[CR]Jimmy52905 on SMWCentral), so no. That said, there are some things I coded[CR]myself, mainly a few simple custom blocks, a couple simple sprites (like the[CR]Yoshi sprite on the lower right corner of the titlescreen), and one of the[CR]bosses. Plus, while the Yoshi ASM wasnt done by me, I did add a few extra[CR]things to it that were not in the ASM patch originally, such as the randomized[CR]idle animation, the patient/hasty egg throw option, and many bug fixes to[CR]it.[CR]- Q: "Can I use the graphics you used in YSQ?"[CR] A: Yes. Youre free[CR]to use whatever graphics you want in YSQ, except for the Yoshi OC sprites.[CR]Youll need my permission to use mine or my friends permission to use theirs.[CR]Also, I released a bunch of graphics I ripped/drew for YSQ already, so you[CR]ought to take a look at SMWCentrals graphics section to see if what you want[CR]to use has been released (the advantage of this being that I made those[CR]graphics submissions are easier to use than if you were to take them out of[CR]YSQ, since YSQs ExGFX and Map16 organization is haphazard at best).[CR]- Q: "I[CR]cant find this secret exit. Where is it?"[CR] A: Quite a few of the secret[CR]exits in YSQ are pretty deviously hidden, so dont give up if you cant seem to[CR]find it. If all else fails, go watch a video of someone playing that level you[CR]cant find the secret exit in, or just message me and Ill help out.[CR]- Q:[CR]"What is the point of the Yoshi coins?"[CR] A: They are meant to be a[CR]challenge for those that want to 100% YSQ. Plus, there is a reward for finding[CR]them all, but its a secret.[CR]- Q: "Can I use YSQ as a base for my hack?"[CR]A: Id be ok with that, but I highly dont recommend it. Youd potentially[CR]encounter lots of glitches due to the ASM changes Ive done to YSQ, and youd[CR]have absolutely no idea what most of those changes even are or where I applied[CR]them. All in all, its not worth it.[CR]- Q: "What is the meaning of[CR]life?"[CR]- A: That question has nothing to do with YSQ, but Ill answer it[CR]anyway. The meaning of life is to put meaning into your[CR]life.[CR]====Misc.====[CR]- If you have any comments about this hack, post[CR]them in the "Yoshis Strange Quest" thread on Super Mario World Central or[CR]message him on any of the sites he has an account on (besides the SMWiki). You[CR]can find him at these places:[CR] - SMWCentral (Yoshifanatic):[CR]http://www.smwcentral.net/?p=profile&amp;id;=13743[CR] - Youtube (yoshifanatic1):[CR]http://www.youtube.com/user/Yoshifanatic1[CR] - deviantART (BiggestYoshifan):[CR]http://biggestyoshifan.deviantart.com/[CR] - FurAffinity (BiggestYoshifan):[CR]http://www.furaffinity.net/user/biggestyoshifan/[CR]- This is the final[CR]version of YSQ, unless I have to submit new version that fixes any glitches me[CR]or the playtesters didnt notice (particularly if they are major[CR]glitches).[CR]- Oh, and thanks for downloading my hack! Hope you enjoy it as[CR]much as I enjoyed making it! ^_^</plot>

    <plot>WARNING: Right now, PG freezes SNES9x during a certain part, making the game[CR]impossible to finish. The latest version of ZSNES works. Chrono Trigger:[CR]Prophet's Guile is a fan game following the story of Magus's rise to power in[CR]the Kingdom of Zeal after arriving in 12000 B.C. thanks to the distortion at[CR]his lair. In his bid to stop Lavos at the Ocean Palace, Magus must gain the[CR]trust of Queen Zeal and abolish all opposition. It's about two regular Chrono[CR]Trigger chapters long, and full of surprises. Work on Chrono Trigger:[CR]Prophet's Guile began in January 2007. ZeaLitY suggested that the Crimson[CR]Echoes team, sidelined for the moment, develop a short ROM hack to be released[CR]in a couple months. Unfortunately, other matters came into play and after the[CR]backbone of the game was coded, work halted and shifted back to Crimson[CR]Echoes. In December 2007, Chrono'99 revived the project and thanks to a[CR]collaborative effort with his leadership, Prophet's Guile now stands complete.[CR]The only casualty of the development process was a plan to re-sprite Magus as[CR]the Prophet, which would have involved exhaustive work. Stay tuned for the[CR]upcoming hack, Chrono Trigger: Crimson Echoes. UPDATE: This works fine on the[CR]latest version of SNES9X (v1.53) without issues. Chrono Trigger Crimson Echoes[CR]was C&amp;D;'d by Square-Enix and will NOT be hosted on RHDN at this[CR]time.[CR]Read[CR]Me:[CR]-------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]CHRONO[CR]COMPENDIUM[CR]Chrono Trigger: Prophets Guile[CR]December 25,[CR]2007[CR]http://www.chronocompendium.com/Term/Chrono_Trigger:_Prophets_Guile.html[CR]-------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]CONTENTS[CR]-------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]1.)[CR]History and Foreword[CR]2.)

Please do not ask me where to get a ROM; it is[CR]assumed[CR]that you have one. Google it. Once the patch is applied, it cannot[CR]be[CR]undone. Also, you need to determine which patch to apply. If you arent[CR]sure[CR]what to do, just apply the one that is named "CTPG-Headered.ips".[CR]Heres the[CR]process:[CR]1. Make a copy of your ROM. This patch cant be[CR]undone, so you probably want to[CR] keep your old ROM untouched.[CR]2. Use[CR]Lunar IPS or a program of your choice to select the patch and the ROM[CR] you[CR]would like to patch it to. If you arent sure what to do, just open[CR] Lunar,[CR]hit Apply IPS Patch, then find the Prophets Guile headered .ips[CR]file.[CR]3. It will then ask you to specify the rom you wish to modify; use[CR]the copy of[CR] your CT rom.[CR]You can also rename the patch to the name of[CR]your rom and run it in ZSNES, and[CR]the emulator will automatically apply it.[CR]They must be in the same folder or[CR]specified in the Paths[CR]options.[CR]-------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]2.)[CR]ROM hacking and[CR]EP[CR]-------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]If[CR]youd like to create your own game or story with Chrono Trigger, its not[CR]too[CR]hard!

This is a vanilla-styled hack for[CR]Super Mario World which changes all the levels in the game and adds several[CR]new gameplay mechanics, custom music, etc. This is a new improved version of[CR]the hack, improves the level design and fixes a LOT of issues that the hack[CR]had along the years, with that this is the definitive version of the hack.[CR]Also, I included a Brazilian portuguese version.</plot>

This hack has: Good Level design, custom music, custom bosses,[CR]custom sprites, HDMA effects, level ASM, custom blocks and more. Here's a[CR]teaser of the hack:  Thank you for everyone that helped me with this work.[CR]Check the Read-me to see the change-log of this version of the[CR]game.[CR]Read Me:[CR]Classic Mario World 3:The Finale [CR]by[CR]Bandicoot.[CR]------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]-Whats[CR]the Story of this game?[CR]Classic Mario World 3 is a sequel of other two[CR]hacks called Classic Mario World 1 and 2.[CR]so the history continues from[CR]where CMW2 stopped.[CR]Id recommend you play the other two to understand the[CR]story.[CR]But to explain,basically Bowser discovered four magical crystals[CR]that contain so much powers,[CR]that crystals was destroyed on the last games,[CR]and Mario Sealed his pieces in a chest that was released in the Space.[CR]But[CR]now somehow Bowser put his hands on this power again and with the help of the[CR]Power Stars from Rosalinas observatory he is unstoppable unless we use the[CR]Shiny stars to destroy the power of Crystals. [CR]-How many exits and levels[CR]this hack have?[CR]This hack have 93 levels and 120 exits to find,26 levels[CR]have a secret exit hidden inside.[CR]Also,I included more 20 levels inside[CR]Toads Bonus House,so we have in total 113 levels and 120 exits.[CR]The levels[CR]inside Toads House doesnt count as exits when completed.[CR]-This game is[CR]hard?[CR]Well,this depends of your habilities,but if you are having some[CR]trouble to complete a level try get some powerups in Toads bonus[CR]house.[CR]Also,I recommend you explore the levels when playing,you will get[CR]good rewards like extras lives and powerups![CR]And also,on my view this hack[CR]is the easiest of the trilogy,if you think this one is hard try the special[CR]worlds inside CMW1 and CMW2 ;)[CR]-How I can acess the Extras Section?[CR]You[CR]need earn 50 Bonus Points that you win if you collect all the Dragon Coins in[CR]a level without any deaths.[CR]-Can I edit this hack?[CR]No,I got some[CR]problems some time ago,because a Guy was stealing levels from my hacks,and[CR]from other users too,and putting them on his own hack and saying that hes the[CR]author.[CR]So Please,dont do this,Also SMWCentral Dont allow users to upload[CR]stolen content from others.[CR]-What the prices of the shop[CR]blocks?[CR]Mushroom:10 coins[CR]Flower :25[CR]Leaf :40[CR]Star :60[CR]-How[CR]many worlds this hack have?[CR]9 worlds,with around 10 levels per world,the[CR]last ones are a bit smaller than the first 6 ones.[CR]Each world has two[CR]secret levels that you have to find except for worlds 8 and 9 that have only[CR]one.

    <plot>Colossus is my ultimate experimental hack, clocking at 95 exits and being my[CR]biggest finished hack to date. Anyways, it becomes harder than Hard[CR]difficulty, and maybe even more so than Way of the M. NOTE: There is a[CR]password protected zip folder called Great Hall. It features more bonus[CR]content that requires you to beat the last world![CR]Read Me:[CR]2nd Ed:[CR]Removed excess sprites since they caused a lot of slowdown unless you played[CR]on an overclocked ZSNES.

    <plot>Initially built as a spiritual sequel to Parallel Worlds, this project has[CR]evolved so much overtime that eventually it became an unofficial sequel to an[CR]M Rated game that was released late in the Nintendo 64 lifespan, none other[CR]than Conker's Bad Fur Day! Including all the same crude humor found in that[CR]Conker game and the many references to movies and games we've come to love.[CR]For obvious reasons, it is also rated ''AO for Adults Only''! It also[CR]includes, but not limited to, new worlds to explore, dungeons with amazing[CR]puzzles like in those Zelda games, new items, upgrades, graphics, ten[CR]different characters to play as, a completely new intro to the game inspired[CR]by those Star Wars movies, five different endings and an epic MSU-1 soundtrack[CR]composed of about one hundred songs! More than twice the replay value Parallel[CR]Worlds had, minus all the frustration of course! The difficulty of this new[CR]hack has been thoroughly adjusted over the course of the eight years of work[CR]involved so that it should be suited to just about everyone that is going to[CR]play it! There's of course some harder rooms and secrets in the game, but[CR]nothing impossible to do that needs you to master every LTTP secret out there![CR]Have fun!

    <plot>This is a hack that transforms Donkey Kong Country into a boss rush mode. Can[CR]you make it through all 7 bosses unscathed? Multiple options can be chosen for[CR]battles. Version 1.5 now has all of the features that DKC2: Brigand Barrage[CR]does, notably: You can choose to play as a two-player team in addition to[CR]going it alone. If playing alone, you can choose whether you start as Donkey[CR]Kong or Diddy, and whether the other Kong is present (For a challenge, try[CR]fighting all of the bosses as Diddy alone). Alternate color palettes can be[CR]chosen for the Kongs, not unlike Super Smash Bros. and other fighting games.[CR]You can also choose to fight individual bosses in addition to battling them[CR]all in succession. Best times are now saved to battery-backed memory for each[CR]individual boss, as well as the total. You may also notice that a few sound[CR]effects have been fixed, and some animations are more fluid than they are in[CR]the original game.[CR]Read[CR]Me:[CR]****************************************************[CR]* Donkey Kong[CR]Country: Boss Blitz, by Mattrizzle[CR]*[CR]****************************************************[CR]I.[CR]Introduction/Overview[CR]------------------------[CR]As the title suggests,[CR]Donkey Kong Country: Boss Blitz is a modification of DKC which transforms the[CR]game into a boss rush mode.[CR]Play against all 7 of the games bosses[CR]consecutively.

No. of Kongs" options have been merged[CR]into a single "Kong Select" option; which displays head icons of the Kongs[CR]- Added a "Boss Select" option: Bosses can now be faced individually instead[CR]of all in one sitting[CR] - The "Team Color" options are now labelled with[CR]numbers instead of having unique names. Also, the sixth and seventh color[CR]schemes were altered to be representative of the teams in DKC2 and 3[CR]respectively.[CR] - "Stopwatch Display" has been renamed "Timer Display"[CR] &gt;[CR]During gameplay, pausing now displays a menu with two options in addition to[CR]exiting the game: returning to the options menu, and restarting the[CR] boss[CR]rush. Similar options also appear when the game ends.[CR] &gt; The timers logic[CR]was altered so that it doesnt begin ticking until you have control of the[CR]Kong(s)[CR] * Demos of each boss play after waiting on the title screen for a[CR]while[CR] * Several animations have been altered to make use of unused[CR]sprites[CR] * Fixed the sound Dumb Drum makes when bouncing off the ground[CR]* Remapped the colors used on the inside of the Kongs mouths so they look less[CR]weird when certain color combinations are used.[CR] [CR]August 16, 2011:[CR]Initial version (1.0) released[CR]III. How to[CR]Patch[CR]----------------[CR]These instructions assume that you know how to[CR]obtain ROMs and use an SNES emulator. If you dont, just use Google![CR]1. Use[CR]Lunar IPS to patch dkc_boss_blitz.ips to a HEADERLESS Donkey Kong Country[CR](U)(R1.0) ROM (CRC32: C946DCA0).[CR] * Lunar IPS can be found at the following[CR]link: http://fusoya.eludevisibility.org/lips/index.html[CR] * If the ROM is[CR]headerless, its size should be 4,096 KB. If not, youll need to remove the[CR]header[CR] with NSRT, which can be downloaded at one of the following links,[CR]depending on your OS:[CR] Windows: http://www.romhacking.net/utils/400/[CR]Mac: http://www.romhacking.net/utils/484/[CR] Linux:[CR]http://www.romhacking.net/utils/401/[CR]2.

    <plot>In the words of its creator, "Arn's Winter Quest has been a labor of love for[CR]me for two months, and rivals those hacks such as Hat Quest and EarthBound[CR]2.5: Electric Boogaloo Joint Jive. It has a lot of fun inside jokes, an[CR]incoherent story, and all new battle graphics. This hack is basically linear[CR]Dragon Warrior with a bunch of humor thrown in, so if you like fighting and[CR]you like funny and you like very hard viewtiful fun time hacks, then don't[CR]play this hack because it'll satisfy your cravings and your head will probably[CR]explode." There are also lots of bugs. Reset everytime you save in a new[CR]place. Actually save. If you die without save-reset, then you'll end up the[CR]first place you saved. If you haven't saved throughout the game, you'll be[CR]dropped in a death ocean. NOTE: YOU MUST EXPAND THE ROM TO 48Mbits *BEFORE*[CR]YOU APPLY THIS PATCH. It's suggested you use Lunar Expand(found on this site)[CR]to do it.[CR]Read Me:[CR]Name=Arns Winter Quest - Gway[CR]Edition[CR]Author=Radiation[CR]Version=Final Release[CR]Description=Loads of[CR]inside jokes, an incoherent story, and snazzy battle graphics.

    <plot>Colinbound Infina's Invasion is a total conversion of the game, Earthbound. I[CR]have completely changed the plot and almost all of text.

    <plot>This game, which you might think of as EarthBound for girls, is a project that[CR]took several years and a lot of work with JHack and Hex Workshop to complete.[CR]Most of what I've changed is character names and the text, although I've also[CR]thrown in a few changes in the graphics I hope you'll find to your liking.[CR]There is no "adult" content in this game unless you count a few items I've de-[CR]censored from Mother 2 that might get a mention on an Internet Movie Data Base[CR]parental guide but wouldn't earn any movie so much as a PG rating (i.e.[CR]references to dating, death, and drugs). This was originally a birthday gift[CR]for a young relative of mine who is about the same age as the protagonist and[CR]even looks a bit like her. While the game story will likely seem rather[CR]familiar from EarthBound, I've added several twists and put my own spin on[CR]things as you'll see when you play it. While Shigesato Itoi's affectionate[CR]parody of America ca. 1995 has aged remarkably well in the past 16 years,[CR]there's always been room to augment and improve upon some of the story's[CR]themes. One recurrent problem I've seen in a lot of other hacks based on[CR]EarthBound is that altering the maps in any way that requires them to be moved[CR]into an expansion area of the ROM will invariably screw up the bus rides and[CR]sometimes the teleportation system. As such, I've done everything I could to[CR]keep those maps from moving in this hack. The slight increase in the hacked[CR]ROM's size comes from one of the new opening splash screens which simply could[CR]not be compressed enough to fit where it originally belonged and therefore had[CR]to be moved into the dead space at the end. Since several valid versions of[CR]EarthBound are floating around online, I've included several different patches[CR]and instructions on how to use them in this file. Since I have played this[CR]hack of the game all the way through twice to check for errors, no game-[CR]breakingly major bugs should remain. As this project was done entirely solo,[CR]however, a few minor glitches I simply failed to spot may remain.[CR]Read[CR]Me:[CR]While not substantially different from each other, several working[CR]versions of EarthBound are available online. Some have an additional half-[CR]kilobyte header and others do not. If you are not sure whether your version is[CR]headered or not, check the files properties for its exact size. An unheadered[CR]version will have 3,145,728 bytes, and a headered version will have 3,146,240[CR]bytes. Due to certain ROM-hacking protocols and a lack of certain controls in[CR]IPS patch creating programs, adding or removing a ROMs header must be done[CR]manually. Included in this archive is the header from EarthBound to compare[CR]against your own copy of the ROM in a hex editor.[CR]To prevent certain[CR]emulators from complaining about failed CRC-32 checks, I have also made[CR]further patches available for padding out the file. (The Checksum-16 on any[CR]patched ROM, however, should always be correct unless the original ROM is[CR]corrupt or you applied the wrong patch.) Once you have applied the appropriate[CR]patch, what you will have is a compact version of The Rat Race. To this, if[CR]you wish to have the correct CRC-32, you may then apply the further patches[CR]which will pad out the file.[CR]The following IPS files in this archive will[CR]convert EarthBound to The Rat Race in its various forms as[CR]indicated:[CR]Conversion[CR]The Rat Race (U-C).ips = from EarthBound[CR]Unheadered to The Rat Race Unheadered and Compact (3,166,416 bytes)[CR]The Rat[CR]Race (H-C).ips = from EarthBound Headered to The Rat Race Headered and Compact[CR](3,166,928 bytes)[CR]Padding:[CR]The Rat Race (U-P).ips = from The Rat Race[CR]Unheadered and Compact to The Rat Race Unheadered and Padded (4,194,304[CR]bytes)[CR]The Rat Race (H-P).ips = from The Rat Race Headered and Compact to[CR]The Rat Race Headered and Padded (4,194,816 bytes)[CR]The Author</plot>

    <plot>What started out with my initial desire to properly case everyone's names[CR]turned into a rather innocent discussion between a co-worker of mine and I[CR]about ways to improve/fix the original game, which in turn (somehow) became[CR]this. FF6 - Brave New World is a fairly complete overhaul of Final Fantasy VI,[CR]featuring... * Character-based esper restrictions and new stat boosts that[CR]promote greater diversity and allow for customized development. * Esper[CR]leveling system that disassociates esper bonuses from traditional levels. *[CR]New and reworked formulas which rescue everything that isn't magic or magic[CR]evasion from the dump-stat heap. * Rebalanced equipment, items, spells, and[CR]skills that aim to remove dead weight and give players more (and better)[CR]choices. * A complete overhaul of enemies from their stats to their behavior[CR]to better challenge veteran players and newcomers alike. * Tons of bugfixes,[CR]as well as remedies to many of the game's more annoying aspects (such as rage[CR]hunting taking a lifetime). * A new script that restores much of what was lost[CR]in translation and builds on existing plotlines and characterization. * And[CR]much, much more, detailed in the Readme (particularly section 4). One thing[CR]BNW is not is a difficulty mod. While it is harder than vanilla FF6, we wanted[CR]to keep it accessible to newcomers while at the same time giving veterans a[CR]new experience. Hopefully, we succeeded. Curious about what other people are[CR]saying about BNW? Like the mod and want to let us know? Hate it and want to[CR]tell us how much we suck? Completely indifferent and just bored? Feel free to[CR]drop by what's become the official forum for discussing BNW: [CR]Read[CR]Me:[CR] Final Fantasy VI: Brave New World - README[CR] TABLE OF[CR]CONTENTS:[CR] 1.

CREDITS and[CR]CLOSING[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]1. A PERSONAL MESSAGE FROM[CR]BTB[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]One[CR]day, about a year and a half ago, a coworker of mine showed me a Final Fantasy[CR]VI ROM editor hed[CR]found on the world-wide pornography receptacle known as[CR]the internet. We got to talking about how the[CR]editor could be used to fix[CR]bugs and other issues in the game, like how some asshole left the caps[CR]lock[CR]on when he was naming everybody. This soon led to a discussion about[CR]how cool it would be if there was a[CR]way to restrict certain espers to[CR]certain characters, beyond which the story differs depending on which[CR]one[CR]of us you ask since neither one of us wants to assume credit for instigating[CR]this mess. What we can[CR]agree on, however, is that the resulting product is[CR]something that were very proud of.[CR]This mod was created in two basic parts.[CR]Using the above-mentioned editor, I set out to work on the[CR]games character[CR]and enemy data, espers, spells, items, and equipment. A summary of these[CR]changes is[CR]provided in the form of a "printme" file, which is meant to[CR]provide helpful supplemental information to[CR]players - a good deal of which[CR]couldnt be easily provided in-game - as well as invoke nostalgia for[CR]the[CR]days when video games didnt suck and the inclusion of such "feelies"[CR]was standard practice for quality[CR]products. A detailed discussion of these[CR]edits can be found in section three of this readme.[CR]The other half of this[CR]mod is basically everything that I couldnt do in the editor, which was[CR]instead[CR]done by Synchysi in a combination of assembly, hex, and[CR]voodoo/witchcraft. These edits include a large[CR]variety of things, many of[CR]which were not at liberty to share (at least not up-front). Those that[CR]DO[CR]need to be advertised, however, are very important to note and are[CR]detailed in section four.[CR]The third half of this mod (math isnt my strong[CR]suit) is the dialogue/script, which was a joint effort[CR]between the two of[CR]us. The goal wasnt so much to change anything as it was to enhance what was[CR]already[CR]there. We aimed to preserve the areas of the original Ted Woolsey[CR]translation that actually worked while[CR]making what didnt more faithful to[CR]the original Japanese. In addition to this, weve further built[CR]upon[CR]existing characterization and storylines in a manner that will[CR]hopefully blend in seamlessly with the[CR]original and avoid an "obvious fan[CR]translation" feel (at least in the parts that were taken seriously).[CR]Were[CR]very interested in hearing what everyone has to say about the mod, so you can[CR]find our contact[CR]information at the bottom of this readme. Feel free to[CR]write to us with any questions or comments, or[CR]even if youre just feeling[CR]lonely (especially if you also happen to be an attractive Swedish[CR]redhead).[CR]And above all else... have fun. If everyone who tries this mod[CR]out has even half as much fun playing it[CR]as Synchysi and I did making it,[CR]then I would consider it a *huge* success.[CR]Oh, and one last thing:[CR] TALK[CR]TO EVERYONE AT THE BEGINNERS SCHOOL AT NARSHE.[CR] -BTB, May[CR]2013[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]2.[CR]INSTALLATION[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Brave[CR]New World is distributed as an .ips patch, which is the standard for SNES mods[CR]as it avoids the[CR]legal issues of distributing a fully-patched ROM. To make[CR]things as easy as possible for everyone, weve[CR]also included a utility[CR]called "Lunar IPS" which will apply the patch to the ROM directly rather[CR]than[CR]having to set it up through your emulator.[CR]To install the patch,[CR]just follow these easy instructions:[CR] ALWAYS PATCH A CLEAN ROM - that is, a[CR]Final Fantasy 3 US (version 1.0 or 1.1, it doesnt matter)[CR] ROM with nothing[CR]else already patched in. This also applies to when you are updating to a[CR]newer[CR] version of the mod. If you dont patch a clean ROM, youre gonna have[CR]a bad time.[CR] There are two versions of the patch: one for headered ROMS (H)[CR]and one for unheadered ROMS (N).[CR] Applying the wrong patch will result in[CR]the game crashing like a Russian spacecraft on re-entry[CR] when you attempt[CR]to run it, so youll know real quick if you fucked up. An easy way to tell[CR]if[CR] your ROM has a header is to check its size: headered ROMS are 3073 kb,[CR]unheadered are 3072 kb.[CR] If you desire, apply the "Clean New World" patch[CR]AFTER applying Brave New World. Be warned that[CR] Clean New World was not[CR]taken seriously and contains obviously (and badly) censored dialogue.[CR] The[CR]most immediate indication youll receive that the patch took is the new default[CR]window style[CR] when the game loads (the patch doesnt change the title screen[CR]- awesome as it would be - to its[CR] official logo). You can also view what[CR]version of the patch youre playing in the config menu.[CR] Dont freak out when[CR]you see that Terra doesnt have her special Magitek commands anymore - this[CR]is an intentional change to clear up much-needed space in the spell[CR]index[CR]Finally, note that while applying an updated version of the patch to[CR]your game will not invalidate your[CR]existing save states, you should save[CR]the game the normal way (that is, by using an in-game save rather[CR]than a[CR]save state) prior to updating and then reset the game afterward. This is to[CR]clear data out of the[CR]SRAM, which often includes shit that we fix in our[CR]updates.[CR]Oh, and one last thing:[CR] TALK TO EVERYONE AT THE BEGINNERS[CR]SCHOOL AT NARSHE.[CR] (Seriously. Im not kidding. Do[CR]it.)[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]3. CHARACTERS and GAME[CR]BALANCE[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]The[CR]original Final Fantasy VI was a lot of things, but challenging wasnt one of[CR]them. The unfortunate[CR]trend of characters being more or less entirely[CR]interchangeable in combat situations noticeably began[CR]with this game and[CR]only got much, much worse as the series continued. A commendable effort to[CR]create an[CR]unprecedentedly complex system of spells and attacks was matched[CR]with oversight ill-equipped to handle[CR]the plethora of bugs and balance[CR]issues inherent in such a setup without obsessive attention to[CR]detail,[CR]resulting in quite possibly one of the most buggy and broken[CR]mainstream games in existence. Luckily, I[CR]just so happen to be both[CR]exceptionally obsessive and have way too much spare time on my hands.[CR]The[CR]discussion of a subject as broad as overall game balance should probably start[CR]at the same place we[CR]did in development, which is at the characters[CR]themselves. At the very heart of the games diversity is,[CR]as mentioned[CR]above, who you can choose to play as. Final Fantasy VI had a rather unique[CR]system in that[CR]pretty much the entirety of character development was tied[CR]to espers, which carried a few rather obvious[CR]downsides. The first is that,[CR]due to poorly-coded/implemented game mechanics, only one stat (magic)[CR]was[CR]at all worth raising in the first place. This led to a great deal of[CR]munchkining despite nothing at all[CR]resembling enough difficulty to warrant[CR]it, especially considering that, because any character can use[CR]any esper,[CR]the endgame invariably devolved into an Ultima spam-fest (which would be the[CR]other downside).[CR]Two major sets of changes were made to the code by[CR]Synchysi (see section four of the readme) in order to[CR]help me deal with[CR]this issue. First, we had to change the way that the game handles every other[CR]stat so[CR]that magic isnt the only one with any significance whatsoever.[CR]Secondly, we had to take care of that[CR]pesky "everybody can equip every[CR]esper" problem. And so, with both learnable spells and boostable stats[CR]now[CR]restrictable by character, I set out to mold each one of them into a unique[CR]flower.[CR]Heres a quick (not really)[CR]rundown:[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]TERRA and CELES[CR] -------------[CR]Terra and Celes are discussed together[CR]because they both still function very similarly to one another.[CR]Theyre[CR]essentially red mages on steroids: Jills-of-all-trades who can easily adapt to[CR]any team you put[CR]them in and who can excel in any role that theyre set up[CR]for. Both lack a directly offensive special[CR]skill, and so their usefulness[CR]is largely dependent on their spells and equipment. Lucky for them,[CR]they[CR]have access to most of the games best equipment along with more espers[CR](and thus more spells) than the[CR]rest of the cast. Terras main advantages[CR]are a superior spell selection and a skill that capitalizes on[CR]her beat-[CR]stick nature, while Celes is more well-rounded with better stats and spells[CR]that tend to focus[CR]more on strategy than raw power.[CR]Runic and Morph have[CR]both been through some significant mechanical changes, as well. The former has[CR]been[CR]standardized to work on all white, grey, and black magic (any spell[CR]that starts with a colored dot), but[CR]not on any "blue" magic (any attack[CR]that doesnt). This, along with the fact that many more enemies use[CR]such[CR]spells in general, is meant to make using the skill both more intuitive to use[CR]and worth your while[CR]to do so. A few assembly hacks (discussed in section[CR]four) also fix some bugs it had so that it feels a[CR]lot more like a proper[CR]ability instead of a broken mess.[CR]Regarding Morph, its now a toggled stance[CR]rather than a timed one and the first of several skills that[CR]aims to rescue[CR]stamina from the "dump stat" heap by allowing it to reduce the doubled damage[CR]that Terra[CR]now takes in her esper form in return for the offensive boost[CR]that it provides. This makes using Morph[CR]a decision that hinges on more[CR]than just a simple matter of Terra being "charged up" for it, and those[CR]who[CR]are willing to suffer the drawbacks will find that a morphed Terra is easily[CR]Brave New Worlds most[CR]fearsome warrior and will likely be the first (and[CR]possibly only) character to hit the damage[CR]cap.[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]LOCKE[CR] -----[CR]At first glance, Locke appears to be nothing more than an[CR]inferior version of Terra and Celes. He lacks[CR]their raw magical power and[CR]their massive spell repertoires, instead focusing mainly on physical[CR]attacks[CR]and healing magic. But what he lacks in their versatility he picks[CR]back up with high speed and evasion.[CR]Neither stat featured very prominently[CR]in the original game, and Locke serves as a good example of just[CR]how[CR]significant these advantages are now. He tends toward armor of the lighter[CR]variety and dual-wielding[CR]is now baked in to his weapon of choice rather[CR]than enabled by a relic, so his main defense is just not[CR]getting hit in the[CR]first place. Furthermore, his speed advantage will be felt both in his role as[CR]healer[CR]as well as his ability to dish out physical damage much faster than[CR]most other characters can.[CR]Lockes magical abilities are also aided by the[CR]fact that he is now one of the three characters to which[CR]the X-Magic[CR]ability is restricted. However, dual-casting with Locke is something of a[CR]double-edged sword[CR]and an effective demonstration of how the more limited[CR]MP pools for the games non-primary spellcasters[CR]relegates them to more[CR]physical roles. That said, Locke is more than capable of outperforming the[CR]girls[CR]on both the offensive and restorative magical fronts, but it requires[CR]a focus on building and managing[CR]his MP in order to pull off.[CR]Rounding[CR]out Lockes skillset is Steal, which was reworked to make a bit of fucking[CR]sense. Only enemies[CR]who might be actually holding something (i.e. humans)[CR]can be stolen from on Brave New World - trying to[CR]steal from a bear will[CR]just get you a very dead Locke. The idea is that fewer and more obvious[CR]targets[CR]for theft along with better rewards for doing so will make treasure[CR]hunting more attractive. The formula[CR]has been reworked to use Lockes speed[CR]for both the odds of success (which previously compared his level[CR]to his[CR]victims) and the odds of getting a "rare" steal (previously a static 1/8[CR]chance), and successful[CR]theft now immediately refills Lockes ATB meter so[CR]that attempts can be chained together. This not only[CR]makes it easier to[CR]quickly rob entire enemy parties, but also upgrades "Mug" to a tactical multi-[CR]strike.[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]EDGAR[CR] -----[CR]In stark contrast to the above, Edgar is a character whose[CR]usefulness is tied almost completely to his[CR]special skills. Although one of[CR]our overall goals was to make regular physical attacks more[CR]appealing,[CR]Edgar remains the games one character with a clearly preferable[CR]alternative is his Chainsaw and/or his[CR]Drill. In the original game, Edgar[CR]peaked early due to his tools being very overpowered initially, but[CR]they[CR]failed to scale well and left him with little else to do in the endgame[CR]besides dragooning. Weve[CR]thus overhauled his tools and their effects in not[CR]only an attempt to keep the skill relevant into the[CR]late game, but also to[CR]reduce the gross amount of redundancy that many of them possessed (Chainsaw[CR]vs.[CR]Drill comes immediately to mind). Of specific note are his two new[CR]tools - the Defibrillator and Mana[CR]Battery - which provide a significant[CR]degree of support utility and allow for an alternate Edgar build[CR]that seeks[CR]to capitalize on something other than just hitting things.[CR]Of course,[CR]making Edgar a physical powerhouse is still very much an option, and his[CR]weapons have been[CR]reworked to ensure that they remain an important part of[CR]his load-out even if they are only functioning[CR]as stat sticks. Swords[CR]provide good basic stat boosts, whereas spears have been retooled into[CR]defensive[CR]weapons that boost max HP and randomly protect allies. Spears now[CR]also possess the "hold with both hands[CR]for moar damage" property (the[CR]"Gauntlet" effect), which can combine with the inherent bonus that[CR]spears[CR]already add to jump attacks for some truly amazing damage. In part[CR]because of this, and in part because[CR]of the whole "unique flower" thing,[CR]dragooning is now exclusive to Edgar and Mog (well, and Gogo).[CR]One[CR]advantage of particular note in going the dragoon route is that jumping[CR]is not subject to the back-row[CR]"half damage" damage penalty, whereas the[CR]Drill and Chainsaw (see section four below) now are.[CR]Ultimately, Edgars[CR]most notable feature in pretty much any build is likely his ability to tank.[CR]He gets[CR]a lot of HP through both his equipment and espers and he likes his[CR]heavy armor. He also gets more than[CR]one long-range physical attack (that[CR]Autocrossbow may end up more useful in the late game than you may[CR]think),[CR]so camping in the back row is always an option for The King. He gets several[CR]healing and support[CR]spells to assist him in this role, but he must rely[CR]exclusively on his other skills for damage[CR]output.[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]SABIN[CR] -----[CR]Sabin has been through quite a number changes in Brave New[CR]World in order to make him fit his character[CR]archetype. Whereas his brother[CR]is basically Kain from FF4 with Tools and a permanent hard-on, Sabin[CR]now[CR]more closely resembles Yang. The mere presence of Blitz originally[CR]relegated his regular attacks to the[CR]rubbish bin, and his claws didnt even[CR]make for decent stat sticks since the best blitzes all did magic[CR]damage[CR](due to the games original physical damage formula being total garbage).[CR]Taking a cue from Yang,[CR]the new name of Sabins game is lots of elemental[CR]damage and lots of status effects: his claws now all[CR]deal elemental damage[CR]and have random spellcasts attached. Hes then forced to dual-wield them in[CR]true[CR]Monk style by no longer being able to equip shields. He makes up for[CR]this, as well as his inability to[CR]wear much in the way of armor, by[CR]possessing some of the games best natural stats, again because[CR]monk.[CR]Blitzes have also been reworked, just as Tools were, in attempt to[CR]keep them all useful throughout the[CR]game. The result is a varied skillset[CR]that provides a choice as to how to develop Sabins stats. A vigor[CR]Sabin,[CR]for example, will focus more on physical blitzes like Pummel and Suplex, both[CR]of which continue[CR]his "status" theme by setting sap and slow, respectively.[CR]Both statuses are of little consequence in the[CR]original game since theyre[CR]the mildest of the lot, but they rise to prominence in Brave New World[CR]where[CR]they are now universally effective - particularly on (most)[CR]bosses.[CR]On the other hand, several blitzes are now affected by Sabins[CR]stamina, making him one of the best users[CR]of this once-useless stat. A[CR]stamina-based Sabin is a more defensive Sabin who assists his allies[CR]with[CR]Mantra and its new counterpart (Chakra) that restores his teams MP[CR]instead of their HP. This Sabin will[CR]rely more on the now stamina-based[CR]Aurabolt blitz for damage, especially since the physical ones[CR](which[CR]Aurabolt is *not*) are now subject to the back-row penalty just as[CR]Edgars Drill and Chainsaw are.[CR]Early in the game, Sabins natural stats will[CR]make him one of the most powerful and beefiest characters[CR]available. Later[CR]on, his limited armor options will become more of an issue and hell have to[CR]rely more[CR]on his high HP to stay on his feet. One advantage of particular[CR]note that Sabin has in this regard is[CR]that his high vigor and stamina will[CR]help him take much more consistent damage from enemy attacks due to[CR]how[CR]they now function as a sort of "natural" defense (see section four below for[CR]details), but he still[CR]ends up eating more of it in the long run than most[CR]everyone else[CR]does.[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]CYAN[CR] ----[CR]Cyan suffered immensely in the original game for being the[CR]most physically-oriented fighter in a world[CR]where magical damage reigned[CR]supreme and shitty balance decisions made 7/8 of his special attacks[CR]not[CR]worth the fucking lifetime it took to use them. He gets a much-needed[CR]overhaul in Brave New World in the[CR]form of a both a new global physical[CR]damage formula that renders his style of combat no longer complete[CR]shit, as[CR]well as some special attention to his special skills in the same vein as Tools[CR]and Blitz before[CR]them. From the undead-vanquishing powers of Mindblow (the[CR]"Dies at 0 MP" flag is now used exclusively on[CR]undead foes) to the supreme[CR]physical damage of Tempest (AKA "Quadra Slice"), every bushido has a[CR]purpose[CR]to fill and a chance to shine. Also, the Bushido meter no longer[CR]takes a fucking lifetime to charge.[CR]Like Sabin, Cyan is now denied the use[CR]of shields in order to force the inherent "can be held with both[CR]hands for[CR]extra damage" bonus on all of his weapons, which helps make even his regular[CR]physical blows a[CR]mighty force to be reckoned with. Also like Sabin, Bushido[CR]techniques that do physical damage will only[CR]be half as strong to those[CR]without a brave warrior spirit who cower in the back row. But even with[CR]these[CR]drawbacks, Cyans heavy armor and earlier access to Empowerer ensures[CR]that hes just as good at taking[CR]damage as he is at dishing it out.[CR]Furthermore, the overall lack of diversity in his esper bonuses more[CR]or[CR]less guarantees that hell end up with more vigor and/or HP than just about[CR]anyone else.[CR]Build-wise, Cyan really only has two options. You either pump[CR]his vigor to solidify him as the resident[CR]king of physical damage or go[CR]balls-deep into HP and stamina to make him a rock that spams stamina-[CR]based[CR]bushidos from the back row. Like Edgar, he has some healing spells so[CR]that he can bring his allies back[CR]from the brink whenever he finds himself[CR]the last man standing, and the fact that Empowerer also absorbs[CR]MP also[CR]makes Cyan one the mods best out-of-battle patch-up guys.[CR]In conclusion,[CR]Cyan is a pretty straightforward guy who mostly hits stuff and tosses out the[CR]occasional[CR]heal regardless of how hes set up, but at least now he does what[CR]he does exceptionally[CR]well.[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]SHADOW[CR] ------[CR]Being a ninja, Shadow naturally winds up in the role of[CR]"fragile speedster" in this mod. He doesnt use[CR]shields because ninjas have[CR]no interest in defending themselves when they can instead be dual-[CR]wielding[CR](or two-handing, in the case of katanas) totally sweet ninja[CR]weapons, and the armor that he does wear is[CR]of the "dont get hit in the[CR]first place" variety. Shadow thus tends to die whenever he gets hit,[CR]but[CR]unless hes up against an attack that cant miss he almost never does. He[CR]nearly ends up with the same[CR]problem as Edgar where a superior - and row-[CR]ignoring - special skill renders his normal physical attacks[CR]pointless and[CR]thus relegates him to permanent "back-row" status, but the high price of[CR]throwables along[CR]with the semi-exclusive option for X-Fight later in the[CR]game are sufficient to lure him out.[CR]Regarding Throw, its now restricted[CR]exclusively to knives, scrolls, and stars (no more chucking swords[CR]or[CR]rods), and each type of throwable now functions more uniquely than before.[CR]Knives tend to do the most[CR]damage, but are more expensive and only single[CR]target, whereas throwing stars can now be "spread" like a[CR]spell to hit a[CR]group of enemies. Scrolls, as always, do elemental damage that can be[CR]extremely powerful[CR]against a single target since the damage is forcibly[CR]"split" against multiple targets. Finally, Shadow[CR]can now set the image[CR]status (also known as "blink") on his teammates rather than just on himself[CR]with[CR]Smoke Bombs (known in the original game as "Shadow Edges"), which[CR]along with his handful of healing and[CR]support spells make him an excellent[CR]utility character to have on hand.[CR]Shadows greatest asset by far, however,[CR]is his unmatched speed. Pound for pound, Shadow has the highest[CR]DPS[CR]potential of any character in the game due (mostly) to just how fast he can[CR]attack; this is why hes[CR]balanced by being made of tissue paper. Add to this[CR]his above-mentioned support capabilities and you get[CR]an incredible addition[CR]to any team - provided you can figure out how to keep him[CR]alive.[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]GAU[CR] ---[CR]Gau has always been a love-him-or-hate-him sort of guy, and at[CR]least that much hasnt changed here. What[CR]Ive tried to do is make it harder[CR]to hate loving him by overhauling his Rage list in the same spirit as[CR]the[CR]other special skills, thus rendering the 64 remaining rages (down from nearly[CR]four times that amount[CR]in the original) at least as desirable as the five[CR]or six of them that were at all useful before, not to[CR]mention a great deal[CR]more diverse. The mechanics of leaping and The Veldt itself have also been[CR]fixed so[CR]that those inclined to use him no longer need to invest a lifetime[CR]into building him up. Without going[CR]into too much detail, enemies without[CR]rages (not to be confused with Men Without Hats) no longer appear[CR]on The[CR]Veldt, and you dont actually have to be on The Veldt to learn their[CR]rages.[CR]Stat-wise, Gau ends up drinking from the same punchbowl as Shadow:[CR]he dies in a gentle breeze, he likes[CR]to evade damage instead of taking it,[CR]and hes one speedy little shit. Much like Shadow - perhaps even[CR]more so -[CR]Gau ends up retardedly fast by the end of the game largely due to a lack of[CR]other useful stats[CR]to boost through his espers. Combined with the fact that[CR]his primary (ok, only) means of attack requires[CR]no user input beyond the[CR]initial selection, Gau can easily be Brave New Worlds fastest character.[CR]In[CR]the end, though, Gau is still the same as hes always been: useful bordering on[CR]broken if used well,[CR]but very difficult to use well. As the majority of his[CR]effectiveness stems directly from proper/clever[CR]use of his rages, the info[CR]found in the printme should prove especially helpful to Gau fans.[CR]Otherwise,[CR]hes designed so that even if you only grab a handful of rages,[CR]those few are at least still[CR]useful.[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]SETZER[CR] ------[CR]Setzer, perhaps most importantly, is one of the games[CR]major healers. Hes also arguably the tankiest,[CR]with the potential to gain[CR]lots of HP and being mostly restricted to heavy armor. While his selection[CR]of[CR]healing spells is obviously important to this role, equally notable are[CR]his Slots. Losing spins are now[CR]twice as powerful as they were in the[CR]original game and act as sort of a poor mans version of Banons[CR]Health[CR]command, thus making for a quite effective - and spammable - full-party[CR]heal.[CR]How Setzer likes to heal will depend in part on where his stats are.[CR]Traditional cure magic scales with[CR]magic power, as do his Slots. The Remedy[CR]and Regen spells, however, which now restore HP in addition to[CR]their normal[CR]effects, instead scale in power with stamina. Both are of much more use in[CR]Brave New World[CR]due to a larger focus on status effects, particularly sap[CR]and regen. Additionally, Setzer is one of only[CR]three casters of an upgraded[CR]Regen spell (the other two being Terra and Relm) which targets the[CR]entire[CR]party and is one of the main selling points of a build that focuses[CR]on stamina over magic.[CR]On the offensive side of things, Slots have been de-[CR]rigged to favor skill completely instead of RNG, and[CR]winning spins allow a[CR]magically-built Setzer to contribute significantly to the teams damage output[CR]if[CR]hes good enough at nailing them. Physically, he has the option to dual-[CR]wield and is now the exclusive[CR]user of the new "X-Fight" relic; he also has[CR]access to weapons that either arent subject to the damage[CR]penalties imposed[CR]by either of those things (Dice) or rely on random procs rather than direct[CR]damage to[CR]be effective (Doom Darts). The fact that Setzer cant raise his[CR]vigor through espers also means that his[CR]physical damage output is[CR]completely unaffected by his build choice. And then theres GP Toss, which[CR]has[CR]been reworked into a stamina-based attack thats most likely a stamina-[CR]focused Setzers best option for[CR]consistent, reliable damage that doesnt[CR]involve giving up his shield.[CR]Ultimately, however, Setzer is more about[CR]tanking than he is about fighting. His ability to take hits[CR]ranks up there[CR]with the likes of Edgar and stamina Cyan, but hes not usually as good at[CR]returning fire[CR]as they are since his attack options tend to require either[CR]luck or sacrifice to be truly viable. Its[CR]through that first catch that[CR]Setzers "gambler" persona carries over to his role in combat, and[CR]most[CR]battles will tend to see him as either a top contributor or a creepy[CR]paperweight.[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]MOG[CR] ---[CR]Mog is something of an oddball character in Brave New World. He[CR]gets a generous selection of esper stat[CR]boosts and a great potential to[CR]maximize them since hes an entirely optional character, but what you[CR]focus[CR]on will depend largely on what you want to do with him. He doesnt really[CR]hybridize well, which[CR]leads to some very unusual and rather extreme build[CR]options.[CR]Probably the most obvious choice is to focus on Mogs magic power,[CR]which boosts both the potency of his[CR]spells and of his offensive dance[CR]steps. With a smattering of offensive and status magic to choose[CR]from,[CR]access to the X-Magic ability, and the ability to equip rods, going[CR]whole hog into jacking up his magic[CR]power is far from a bad idea. Note,[CR]however, that Dance also uses his stamina not only to determine the[CR]odds of[CR]stumbling on non-native terrain, but also to raise the effectiveness of the[CR]steps that heal the[CR]party. The eight dances themselves have been rebalanced[CR]to be more uniquely tailored to specific builds[CR]and situations rather than[CR]just being the same thing eight times over, just with different[CR]backgrounds.[CR]Water Rondo, for example, is a heavily offensive dance that[CR]will be mostly appreciated by a magic-built[CR]Mog looking to deal big damage,[CR]whereas Forest Suite is a more defensive dance that can be utilized[CR]to[CR]great effect by a tankier build. Both examples are particularly useful[CR]in boss battles, whereas other[CR]dances like Love Sonata and Dusk Requiem are[CR]more suited to random crowd control.[CR]On the flip-side, Mog can also opt to[CR]forgo all of that "magic" crap and embrace his role as the mods[CR]other[CR]potential dragoon. While he may at first appear to be pretty much just Edgar,[CR]but cuter, he gains[CR]access to a few things that drastically set him apart[CR]from everyones favorite perv, the least of which[CR]is a weapon type other[CR]than spears that make for viable pogo sticks. Generally speaking, Mog most[CR]likely[CR]wont be doing much attacking aside from jumping since his physical[CR]damage output is otherwise lacking.[CR]Ideally, whenever a physically-built[CR]Mog isnt taking a hint from Van Halen, hell instead be taking[CR]advantage of[CR]his spells and dances that dont rely on his raw magic power to be[CR]effective.[CR]The conclusion is that, while Mog has many skills and abilities[CR]available to him, no one build is really[CR]able to take full advantage of[CR]them all. Instead, its better to focus on what you want out of him and[CR]work[CR]toward that goal. Failing that, he tends to be a sub-par character with little[CR]purpose other than[CR]being the adorable team/corporate mascot and a rather[CR]blatant author[CR]avatar.[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]STRAGO[CR] ------[CR]Strago is essentially Cyans magical counterpart in Brave[CR]New World: he casts the spells that makes the[CR]peoples fall down. He boasts[CR]the highest natural (and potential) raw magic power in the game, as well[CR]as[CR]an ability which makes great use of it. Lore, as you can probably guess[CR]by now, has been given the same[CR]treatment as every other skill before it[CR](Rage being perhaps the best direct comparison) wherein all of[CR]the useless[CR]crap has been dutifully pruned out and all that remains is now more useful.[CR]His normal spell[CR]selection is a bit less impressive, but he gets X-Magic to[CR]keep it competitive/interesting. As for his[CR]equipment, all rods (Stragos[CR]weapon of choice) now possess the "consumes MP for critical hits"[CR]property[CR]so that their random spellcasts can help Strago deal big magical[CR]damage even with his regular attacks.[CR]All of this makes him more dependent[CR]on MP than any other character to be at all effective in battle,[CR]however,[CR]and so hes one of the few characters able to significantly boost it through[CR]both espers and[CR]equipment and one of only two to which the Osmose spell is[CR]now restricted.[CR]Stragos two main disadvantages are that hes squishy and hes[CR]slow as all fuck. His natural stats and[CR]armor will provide him with good[CR]magical defense, but his physical defense and HP will remain quite low.[CR]His[CR]shitty speed can be overcome with enough of the right equipment, though it[CR]will likely come at the[CR]expense of maximizing his other stats (by which I[CR]mean his magic power). How hes built and loaded out[CR]will hinge mostly on[CR]whether you prefer to use him primarily as a nuker or to take advantage of the[CR]many[CR]utility spells and lores that he possesses to support the rest of the[CR]team. In either case, he probably[CR]needs to stay in the back row since the[CR]only advantage of not doing so is better random cast damage from[CR]his rods -[CR]and I can really only think of three or four or five situations where thats[CR]worth dying[CR]for.[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]RELM[CR] ----[CR]Relm may seem like a pint-sized, foul-mouthed version of her[CR]grandfather at first, but shes actually a[CR]very different beast. Both are[CR]glass cannons with an emphasis on powerful magic, but their[CR]similarities[CR]end there. First off, she trades a bit of her grandfathers raw[CR]magic power to get back some much-needed[CR]speed. Second, Relm possesses a[CR]handful of the games strongest spells both as her main advantage and as[CR]her[CR]main weakness. Dubbed "Little Miss Overkill" in testing, Relm functions well[CR]as both an offensive[CR]powerhouse and as a traditional healer. The downside[CR]is that shes something of a two-trick pony and has[CR]little else going on for[CR]her otherwise. Her early-game offense is largely limited to Sketch - which[CR]has[CR]at least been fixed to no longer destroy the universe when she uses it,[CR]as well as to actually deal some[CR]fucking damage once in awhile. And her[CR]primary healing ability outside of end-game magic is whacking her[CR]friends[CR]with a paint brush, which (for some reason) now heals them. Definitely a late[CR]bloomer, this one.[CR]Because of Relms strong emphasis - that is to say her[CR]outright dependence - on powerful magics, shes[CR]the (only) other character[CR]who now learns Osmose so that she at the very least remains self-[CR]sufficient.[CR]Just remember that shes still quite squishy, so stick her in[CR]the rear and use her speed and offensive[CR]magic as a means to eliminate as[CR]much of the enemy threat as quickly as[CR]possible.[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]UMARO AND GOGO[CR] --------------[CR]These two, lastly, end up in Brave New[CR]World as largely enhanced versions of what I presume they were[CR]originally[CR]meant to be. Umaro is big, strong, and hits like a fucking truck. Due to this,[CR]hell appeal[CR]greatly to inexperienced players that are just looking for a[CR]tank to smash shit up. But because he cant[CR]really do anything *else*, his[CR]long-term usefulness is somewhat limited.[CR]Gogo, on the other hand, looks[CR]downright horrid on paper due to his shit stats and generally[CR]lackluster[CR]equipment options. However, the mysterious pile of rags holds[CR]great rewards for the clever player who[CR]takes the time to unlock his true[CR]potential. In the original game, Gogos role was heavily diminished by[CR]the[CR]aforementioned fact that, by the time you found him, your team was already[CR]full of faceless Ultima[CR]factories. But if weve at all succeeded in our goal[CR]to mold every character into a unique being, each[CR]with their own distinct[CR]advantages and disadvantages, then there is tremendous value in someone who[CR]can[CR]wield any of those advantages at will. In fact, if not for his abysmal[CR]stats, Gogo would be hands-down[CR]the absolute best character in the game.[CR]And even with them... he still very well may[CR]be.[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Finally,[CR]theres the obstacles that your team will face: the enemies themselves.[CR]Something that I firmly[CR]believe to be a common failing of many mods is an[CR]either overwhelming or outright complete focus on the[CR]challenge, whereas[CR]the design philosophy driving Brave New World is that challenge is merely a[CR]means to[CR]an end and that the focus of (almost) any good game should instead[CR]be on the characters that you control[CR]to overcome them. Make no mistake:[CR]this mod is is more difficult than the original game, and not just by[CR]sheer[CR]virtue of fixing its many broken mechanics. However, Brave New World was[CR]neither made nor marketed[CR]as a "difficulty" hack - a label far better[CR]suited to mods that place their difficulty in the spotlight.[CR]Back to the[CR]point, the changes made to enemies in this mod are worthy of note because they[CR]represent a[CR]significantly large portion of the total work done. Everything[CR]about enemies, from their stats to their[CR]formations to their AI, has been[CR]gutted and rebuilt from the ground up. The primary goals are a[CR]greater[CR]variety of enemy behavior and an increased focus on good strategy[CR](as in, not just mashing A to win) in[CR]order to defeat them. Once again,[CR]many other mods tend to fall into the trap of interpreting "strategy"[CR]as[CR]"do this one specific thing to win", or worse "exploit this one broken[CR]mechanic to win". And not to[CR]beat a dead horse here, but our mod isnt about[CR]that. Brave New World is about choice - to make the game[CR]your own and find[CR]your own route to victory, wherever that route may take you.[CR]As you can[CR]see, any discussion about the enemies in this mod will quickly turn into[CR]discussion about its[CR]attitude toward difficulty in general. To say more[CR]about them than I already have would spoil the fun of[CR]figuring them out for[CR]yourself. Pay attention, use all of the tools at your disposal (that includes[CR]the[CR]ol brain meats), and most importantly...[CR] TALK TO EVERYONE AT THE[CR]BEGINNERS SCHOOL AT NARSHE.[CR] (Or Ill eat your fucking[CR]children.)[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]4. PATCHES and ASSEMBLY[CR]HACKS[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Esper Restrictions This is pretty much the cornerstone of the entire mod; it[CR]restricts the[CR] ------------------ use of espers only to characters who are[CR]compatible with them (see the[CR] printme for a full list), thus allowing us[CR]to make the characters more[CR] unique due to the fact that espers are pretty[CR]much the only contributing[CR] factor to character development in Final[CR]Fantasy VI.[CR] Esper Bonuses Aside from the above (and complimentary to it),[CR]the most sweeping change[CR] made in Brave New World is transforming the esper[CR]level-up stat bonuses[CR] from an apparent last-minute afterthought in the[CR]games design into the[CR] core of character development and customization.[CR]Espers now offer the following (per-level) stat bonuses:[CR] HP +60[CR] MP[CR]+40[CR] HP +30/MP +15[CR] HP +30/Stamina +1[CR] MP +25/Stamina +1[CR] Vigor[CR]+1/HP +20[CR] Magic +1/MP +15[CR] Vigor +1/Speed +1[CR] Magic +1/Speed +1[CR]Vigor +1/Stamina +1[CR] Magic +1/Stamina +1[CR] Speed +1/Stamina +1[CR] Vigor[CR]+2[CR] Magic +2[CR] Stamina +2[CR] Speed +2[CR] Esper Experience We[CR]encountered several obstacles regarding esper stat boosts, the least[CR] of[CR]which was that almost every stat sucked (see "nATB System", "Physical[CR]Damage", and "Stamina Overhaul" below) and the most persistent of which[CR]was that FF6s leveling system was clearly not designed with esper stat[CR]boosts in mind. This ultimately resulted in an environment where, after[CR]everything else was all said and done, players were penalized for not[CR]keeping levels as low as possible in the early game because every level[CR]gained without espers was "empty". Late-game characters like Setzer and[CR]Strago were hit particularly hard by this, as was any character build[CR]which relied heavily on World of Ruin espers (i.e. magic/support Locke).[CR]To balance this, stat boosts from espers were given their own leveling[CR]system independent of regular levels. Each character starts out at an[CR]"esper level" (EL) of 0 - regardless of their regular level - and gains[CR] EP[CR](exp. for esper levels) according to the following formula:[CR] EP = (spell[CR]points * exp.) / 8[CR] (NOTE: Spell points were renamed from "magic[CR]points")[CR] Note that esper levels use the same experience table as regular[CR]levels[CR] and cap at 25. Also note that a character will not gain any EP if[CR](s)he[CR] has no esper equipped, which is no longer an issue because...[CR]Esper Bank The newfound advent of character builds eventually found itself at[CR]odds[CR] with the fact that they still had to equip espers to learn spells,[CR]which[CR] meant a lot of battles on the Veldt and/or micromanagement of[CR]experience[CR] gains to avoid gaining unwanted esper levels. To alleviate this[CR]concern[CR] and finally put the whole matter to bed once and for all, spell[CR]points[CR] earned by characters in battle now go into a "bank" for each[CR]character,[CR] and spells are now learned by spending them in the esper menu[CR]without[CR] needing to actually equip that esper and fight with it on. The[CR]learning[CR] rate for spells on espers is now the cost of that spell; the[CR]maximum[CR] amount of spell points that any character can bank at a time is[CR]30.[CR] Similarly, esper levels are "banked" in the same manner as spell[CR]points[CR] are rather than being granted immediately upon earning them in[CR]battle.[CR] This completely eliminates the need to micro-manage equipped[CR]espers for[CR] the purposes of stat gains, and it also allows for a "re-spec"[CR]feature[CR] later in the game that reverts all of your spent ELs to the bank[CR]so that[CR] you can rebuild characters with different stat boosts. To spend a[CR]banked[CR] EL, just click on the EL bonus in the esper menu. Pretty simple,[CR]right?[CR] Esper Junctions The only problem with how the EL bank system[CR]removed the need to micro-[CR] manage espers was exactly that - players no[CR]longer had a reason to care[CR] who had what equipped since the only[CR]functional difference between them[CR] all at that point was summoning them in[CR]battle. To address this, espers[CR] now have an "on equip" bonus just like a[CR]piece of equipment - such as a[CR] stat boost or reducing incoming elemental[CR]damage - that is completely[CR] separate from that espers EL bonus.[CR] For[CR]example, Kirin offers a +5 bonus to Magic when equipped, but raises[CR] HP and[CR]Stamina for each EL spent. The former is a static bonus that is[CR] only[CR]present so long as Kirin remains equipped, whereas EL bonuses are[CR]permanent, cumulative, and not contingent on the esper being equipped.[CR]Characters may also mix and match EL bonuses from their available espers[CR]to their liking, whereas only one may be equipped at any given[CR]time.[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Levels and Experience Character levels are now capped at 50 with a "soft" cap[CR]starting in the[CR] ------------------- late 30s (expected end-game levels are[CR]mid-30s). Growth is otherwise[CR] linear except for three "humps" after levels[CR]10, 20 and 30. For more[CR] details, consult the experience/level chart in the[CR]printme.[CR] Level Averaging In the original game, characters were brought up[CR]to the teams average[CR] level at set points throughout the game. This was a[CR]feature we initially[CR] removed entirely due to issues discussed above with[CR]esper stats, as well[CR] as to encourage using a variety of characters rather[CR]than just the same[CR] four characters while everyone else sits on the bench.[CR]The EL system has[CR] since removed the first problem, and so weve reinstated[CR]level averaging[CR] in a manner that only addresses the second.[CR] To the[CR]point, level averaging now occurs at only one point in the game[CR] aside from[CR]initial averaging thats done for each character when they[CR] join (or, in[CR]Shadows case, *every* time he joins you in the World of[CR] Balance). Everyone[CR]gets re-averaged at the games halfway mark, which is[CR] importantly distinct[CR]from how the game originally did it for everyone[CR] when you re-obtained them[CR]later on; with the averaging all done at once,[CR] theres no longer any[CR]benefit in putting off getting anyone back.[CR] (Also note that, for obvious[CR]reasons, esper levels cannot be gained via[CR] re-averaging - that much must[CR]still be done the old-fashioned way.)[CR] Concerning the initial levels that[CR]characters join up at, that has also[CR] been changed. In the original game,[CR]most characters joined at slightly[CR] above the party average, whereas now[CR]everyone except Gogo (average -3)[CR] and Umaro (average +5) now joins at the[CR]exact[CR]average.[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]nATB System The short explanation of what this hack does is that it pauses the[CR]ATB[CR] ----------- timer during attack animations, while the "Fight" command[CR]is targeting,[CR] and while Bushido is charging. This has two effects: one, it[CR]makes speed[CR] contribute more significantly to how fast and often a[CR]character acts in[CR] battle, as well as preventing it from effectively soft-[CR]capping at around[CR] 60 or so; two, it removes the exploit of camping in the[CR]item menu under[CR] the "wait" setting to gain a huge speed advantage. The[CR]resulting system[CR] is basically a modified version of "wait", which I[CR]mention because there[CR] is no longer an "active/wait" setting, nor a "battle[CR]speed" slider.[CR] Speed Tweak Removing the soft cap from speed and thus[CR]allowing faster characters to[CR] get more turns over time turned it into[CR]something of a DPS god stat, if[CR] not just a god stat in general. In[CR]response to this, the overall effect[CR] of speed was lowered at high levels[CR]while slightly raising the effective[CR] speed of slower characters. Refer to[CR]the below benchmarks, comparing the[CR] number of turns gotten by several[CR]characters over the same timeframe.[CR] CHARACTER TURNS (OLD) TURNS (NEW)[CR]--------------- ----------- -----------[CR] Strago (31 SPD) 4.0 4.0[CR] Terra[CR](48 SPD) 5.33 5.0[CR] Celes (71 SPD) 7.0 6.0[CR] Shadow (126 SPD) 10.66[CR]8.4[CR] First Strike On the flip-side of the above, a major intended feature[CR]of speed was to[CR] allow faster characters to act first in battle. The[CR]original formula to[CR] determine characters initial ATB fill in battle took[CR]speed very little[CR] into account and was instead largely randomized. Speed[CR]is now factored[CR] more heavily, with faster characters like Locke and Shadow[CR]now getting[CR] first strike in battles much more often than not.[CR] Initital[CR]ATB fill% =[CR] OLD: ([Spd...(2Spd - 1)] + ([0...9] * 8) + 16G) * 256 /[CR]65535[CR] NEW: ([2Spd...(3Spd + 29)] + ([0...9] * 4) + G) * 256 / 65535[CR] G[CR]= (10 - Number of entities in battle)[CR] Command Delays Complementary to the[CR]above changes, we have edited the delays between[CR] command input and[CR]execution to balance various skills:[CR] NO DELAY ($00) SHORT DELAY ($10)[CR]-------------------- --------------------[CR] Steal/Mug Fight[CR] Runic[CR]Item[CR] Leap Rage[CR] Mimic Dance[CR] Revert Throw[CR] Defend/Row Sketch[CR]Possess Health[CR] Magitek ???[CR] MODERATE DELAY ($20) LONG DELAY ($40)[CR]-------------------- --------------------[CR] Magic/X-Magic* Morph[CR] Tools[CR]Summon (esper)[CR] Blitz[CR] Bushido HUGE-ASS DELAY ($70)[CR] Slots/GP Toss[CR]--------------------[CR] Lore Jump (air time)[CR] *X-Magics delay is[CR]effectively $40 in practice[CR] And thats... really all you need to know.[CR]Below, Ill go into the finer[CR] details of battle timing and what nATB had to[CR]change to work within the[CR] game, but Id recommend just skipping ahead to[CR]the physical damage hack.[CR]-------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Combat Speed First of all, the nATB system triples the speed of the combat[CR]timer to[CR] make up for the fact that it pauses it incessantly. This is[CR]meaningless[CR] to the layperson as the combat timer concerns only enemy A.I.,[CR]but what[CR] is relevant are the speed "multipliers" for the haste and slow[CR]statuses[CR] (plus a third for "normal" speed). Because even small speed[CR]differences[CR] are much more impacting in nATB - and also because Slow is now[CR]effective[CR] against anything (even bosses) without inherent haste - it was[CR]necessary[CR] to narrow the gap between the three statuses to keep them in[CR]check:[CR] NEW MULTIPLIERS OLD MULTIPLIERS[CR] ---------------[CR]---------------[CR] Slow 60x Slow 32x[CR] Normal 75x Normal 64x[CR] Haste 90x[CR]Haste 84x[CR] Note that while the end result is a net increase to the flow of[CR]combat,[CR] the pacing will feel slower very early in the game when your have[CR]fewer[CR] characters (especially given that Terra is one of the slower[CR]characters[CR] in the mod) and you dont yet have any speed-boosting espers or[CR]gear.[CR] Status Timers Several status effects utilize a timer to determine[CR]when they wear off;[CR] since these are different timers than the global timer[CR]mentioned above,[CR] it was again necessary to shorten their durations to[CR]compensate for the[CR] fact that their incrementation is constantly being[CR]interrupted:[CR] NEW TIMER SETTINGS OLD TIMER SETTINGS[CR] ------------------[CR]------------------[CR] Stop 5 Stop 18[CR] Sleep 10 Sleep 18[CR] Freeze 10[CR]Freeze 34[CR] Reflect 15 Reflect 26[CR] Condemned * Condemned *[CR] Note that[CR]cutting the timers for sleep and reflect in half renders their[CR] durations[CR]about the same as they were originally, while stop and freeze[CR] were further[CR]reduced as a balance measure. Condemned is a bit tricky,[CR] since its timer[CR]is generated by the following formula:[CR] Random Number = [Casters[CR]Lv...((Casters Lv * 2) - 1)][CR] Timer starts @ (79 - Random Number) / 2[CR](NOTE: minimum starting timer value is 10)[CR] This formula is largely[CR]identical to the one from the original game; all[CR] thats been changed is[CR]that both the end result and the minimum starting[CR] time have been cut in[CR]half to compensate for nATB.[CR] Timer Speed The speed at which the timers[CR]count down in the original game is roughly[CR] 1 tick every 1-2 seconds; the[CR]nATB system cuts that speed about in half[CR] due to the constant[CR]interruptions. The X-factor in play here is that the[CR] speed of these timers[CR]is also affected by slow and haste - theyll count[CR] down slower if youre[CR]slowed and faster if youre hasted. For the most[CR] part this makes sense,[CR]since the beneficial status will cause negative[CR] ones to wear off more[CR]quickly and the detrimental one makes them linger.[CR] However, the frequency[CR]of regen/sap/poison ticks (which are also edited[CR] by nATB, but unimportant[CR]to this discussion) are also affected by timer[CR] speed, which means that a[CR]hasted character will also take more frequent[CR] damage from sap and poison[CR]while a slowed character takes less. It also[CR] means that the condemned[CR]status kills you quicker if youre hasted and[CR] slower if youve been slowed.[CR]Reflect is sort of a wash since it can be[CR] seen as either positive or[CR]detrimental depending on your situation, but[CR] the fact that its duration is[CR]tied to your speed is still kind of weird.[CR] !Viva La Retreat! The last[CR]thing that nATB edits is the run timer, since running away from[CR] fights[CR]would be virtually impossible it it didnt. I wont get into the[CR] specifics[CR]since theyre largely irrelevant, but the short answer is that[CR] running away[CR]is somewhat harder than before under ordinary circumstances[CR] and a lot[CR]harder from non-overworld battles in second half of the game.[CR] Its[CR]generally advised to warp (via Warp Whistles or the titular spell)[CR] from[CR]late-game encounters if you wish to avoid[CR]them.[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Physical Damage The formula for physical (non-magical) damage dealt by[CR]characters has[CR] --------------- been completely rewritten so that vigor[CR]plays a more significant role.[CR] OLD PHYSICAL DAMAGE FORMULA[CR]---------------------------[CR] Dmg = BatPwr + (Lv^2 * (2Vgr + BatPwr) / 256)[CR]* 3/2[CR] NEW PHYSICAL DAMAGE FORMULA[CR] ---------------------------[CR] Dmg[CR]= 2Vgr + BatPwr + ((Lv^2 * Vgr / 16) * (BatPwr / 16)) / 24[CR] Vigor = Defense[CR]In addition to determining physical damage dealt, vigor now helps reduce[CR]incoming physical damage, as well. See "Random Variance" in the stamina[CR]overhaul section below for more details.[CR] Back Row Nerfs The back row now[CR]only reduces incoming physical damage by 25%. Outgoing[CR] physical damage is[CR]not only still halved, but the penalty now extends to[CR] physical damage[CR]dealt by the Tools(*), Blitz, and Bushido commands[CR] (*Exception: the[CR]Autocrossbow, which is long range)[CR] For the record, the only two commands[CR]that inherently deal row-ignoring[CR] physical damage regardless of weapon are[CR]Jump and Throw. Physical damage[CR] from other commands, i.e. Mug and Sketch,[CR]does not ignore row. The fixed[CR] damage from GP Toss also ignores row, but[CR]is not considered physical.[CR] Blind Accuracy Further to the above, the blind[CR]status (renamed from "dark") now affects[CR] all physical and most(*) stamina-[CR]based damage from special commands (all[CR] of which remain otherwise 100%[CR]accurate). The exception is (hilariously[CR] enough) Sketch, which is[CR]technically classified as a magical attack.[CR] (*Exception: Cyans Eclipse[CR]bushido, as noted in the printme)[CR] In addition, hitting something in the[CR]back (side/pincer attacks) is now[CR] affected by blindness, as well, whereas[CR]before a back attack would never[CR] miss under any circumstances. It also[CR]isnt circumvented by weapons that[CR] never miss or by relics that grant[CR]perfect[CR]accuracy.[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Stamina Overhaul In the original game, stamina did as close to nothing as a[CR]stat could[CR] ---------------- possibly do without actually doing nothing[CR](like evasion did). Its main[CR] purpose was to act as a separate layer of[CR]evasion against attacks which[CR] considered it, except only instant death[CR]attacks did. That role has now[CR] expanded to include fractional damage (i.e.[CR]Demi), redirectional damage[CR] ("steals HP"), MP damage, and all status[CR]ailments. To further emphasize[CR] the role of stamina in defending you[CR]against such attacks, its now the[CR] *only* evasion check against them. In[CR]the printme, this is indicated by[CR] listing their hitrates as "Stam%", so[CR]thats what that is.[CR] The stamina evasion formula is a simple (Stamina/128)[CR]chance of success,[CR] and a rewrite of its functionality allows it to only[CR]consider the status[CR] portion of attacks that also deal regular damage. Such[CR]attacks will use[CR] regular (or magical) evasion to determine hit probability[CR](assuming that[CR] its an attack that can be dodged), and then will run a[CR]stamina check if[CR] the attack hits to determine if the status is set. In the[CR]printme, such[CR] attacks use the verbiage "may set (status)" instead of "sets[CR](status)".[CR] This edit also affects negative statuses set by enemy "special"[CR]attacks:[CR] regular physical attacks with either an added status effect or a[CR]damage[CR] multiplier (most notably used by Gau in most of his rages).[CR](NOTE: any attack with "Stam%" accuracy will always set its status when[CR] it[CR]hits, since its hitrate IS the stamina check)[CR] It should be noted that[CR]enemies also possess stamina; Brave New World[CR] lowers the minimum and[CR]maximum values for enemy stamina from 17~40 to[CR] 1~32 (the formula is simply[CR][MaxHP/256] with a cap at 32). This is done[CR] so that weak enemies remain[CR]vulnerable to status attacks while casting[CR] Slow on a boss still has a[CR]relatively decent chance (75%) to hit.[CR] To keep things simple for the[CR]player, all attacks which are used only by[CR] your party skip the stamina[CR]check for statuses if the attack also deals[CR] damage. This is done to remove[CR]unnecessary guesswork since enemies dont[CR] give any visual indication of[CR]many statuses, such as slow or blind. I do[CR] make an exception with the[CR]"Chocobo/Chocobo/Chocobo" winning Slots spin,[CR] since stop is a bit too OP[CR]to allow players to set en masse with perfect[CR] accuracy. The other outliers[CR]are Drain and Osmose, which foes dont use[CR] so that I could give them set[CR]hitrates instead of stam% ones; the Bserk[CR] and Imp spells, which cant miss[CR]since they can be used beneficially on[CR] your own party; and the Poison[CR]spell (but *not* Bio), so that its the[CR] better spell to use if youre just[CR]looking to set the status.[CR] Random Variance In addition to helping you[CR]avoid most of the nastier side effects of[CR] magical attacks, stamina now[CR]also acts as an additional layer of defense[CR] against their primary effects[CR]in the same manner that vigor now reduces[CR] physical damage. This is done[CR]via the games "random variance" formula,[CR] which is applied to every attack[CR]that doesnt do a set amount of damage.[CR] OLD RANDOM VARIANCE FORMULA:[CR]----------------------------[CR] Damage = (Damage * [224...255] / 256) + 1[CR]NEW RANDOM VARIANCE FORMULA:[CR] ----------------------------[CR] Damage =[CR](Damage * [Low...High] / 225) + 1[CR] Low = 225 - (Vigor or Stamina * 2/3)[CR]High = 255 - (Vigor or Stamina)[CR] In the original game, random variance was[CR]a fixed range between 87% and[CR] 99% of the original value; in Brave New[CR]World, high vigor and/or stamina[CR] will help you take less - and more[CR]consistent - damage from attacks. To[CR] better demonstrate the effects of[CR]this, here are some examples:[CR] 24 Vigor/Stamina = 92% ~ 102%[CR] 30[CR]Vigor/Stamina = 91% ~ 100%[CR] 36 Vigor/Stamina = 89% ~ 97%[CR] 42[CR]Vigor/Stamina = 87% ~ 94%[CR] ---[CR] 60 Vigor/Stamina = 82% ~ 86%[CR] 90[CR]Vigor/Stamina = 73%*[CR] 120 Vigor/Stamina = 64%*[CR] (*A negligible amount of[CR]variance still applies)[CR] The four benchmarks on the top represent the[CR]initial values that (most)[CR] characters possess for vigor and stamina, while[CR]the three on the bottom[CR] show the effects of raising them via equipment[CR]and/or espers. Note that[CR] the range of damage at 60 vigor/stamina is[CR]significantly smaller than at[CR] the earlier benchmarks, and the variance[CR]disappears (*almost) completely[CR] at 90 when the ceiling hits the floor.[CR]Vigor and stamina see diminishing[CR] returns beyond that point as the ceiling[CR]continues to drop at the same[CR] rate as the floor, though it should be worth[CR]mentioning that very few[CR] characters will realistically ever reach that[CR]point.[CR] (Also, in case you were wondering, curative spells and abilities[CR]still[CR] use the old random variance formula.)[CR] Stamina Attacks Less[CR]broadly, stamina is now a factor in several spells/attacks/commands[CR](replacing the role of magic power wherever applicable), making it more[CR]individually appealing to the characters that use them. This includes...[CR]...the Remedy and Regen spells (which now also cure HP)[CR] ...Harvester and[CR]Sun Bath (Rage/Dance moves)[CR] ...Rock, Tentacle, and Shrapnel (Rage[CR]attacks)[CR] ...several blitzes (refer to the printme for details)[CR] ...two[CR]bushidos (ditto)[CR] ...Dance (non-native dance success % = (96 + Stam * 2) /[CR]255)[CR] ...Morph (see "Morphology" description below)[CR] ...GP Toss (see[CR]"Make It Rain" description below)[CR] ...Umaros "Blizzard" attack (see "Umaro[CR]Hit Hard" below)[CR] ...the Atma/Omega Weapon (see "Atma and Omega"[CR]description below)[CR] ...desperation attacks (previously magic-based)[CR]...Interceptor (ditto)[CR] ...??? ((Lv^2 * Stam) / 12) + (Users Current HP *[CR]2)[CR] Just to be clear, all of the above except for the Atma/Omega Weapon[CR]are[CR] considered to be magical rather than physical and are thus unaffected[CR]by[CR] 25% physical damage boosts from relics/espers or the back-row[CR]penalty.[CR] (And just to be clearer, ALL DAMAGE IS MAGICAL UNLESS OTHERWISE[CR]STATED.)[CR] Tank and Spank Counter to the above, which sells stamina as an[CR]alternative attack stat[CR] with some defensive capabilities, we wanted a way[CR]of meshing it with the[CR] other stats in a meaningful way. It was thus[CR]decided that it should be[CR] tied to two equipment-enabled abilities: cover[CR](synergizes with HP) and[CR] counter-attacks (synergizes with vigor).[CR] As[CR]was the case in vanilla, characters with "true knight" equipment will[CR]always take hits for allies who are at "near fatal" status, even if they[CR]themselves are also at critical HP. Now, in addition to that, guardians[CR]who are not in critical status may also take hits for *healthy* allies.[CR]Cover% (healthy allies) = Stam / 192[CR] To balance this, characters can no[CR]longer cover AT ALL while in the back[CR] row, evasion is halved for any[CR]attack that he or she jumps in front of,[CR] and covering an ally will break a[CR]character out of the "defend" status.[CR] Interceptor will also not protect[CR]Shadow if hes covering someone else.[CR] (See "Smart Cover" below for further[CR]changes to the cover mechanic.)[CR] For the "spank" half of things, the games[CR]original counter-attack rate[CR] was 75%. We found this to be excessive once[CR]we got other things sorted[CR] out (see "Parry and Counter" below), so we[CR]opted for a new formula that[CR] bases the counter-attack rate on stamina[CR](starting at a floor of ~50%).[CR] Counter-Attack% = (Stam + 32) / 128[CR](See also "Parry and Counter" below.)[CR] Sap and Regen Moving on, the[CR]formulas for regen and sap/poison (all of which are much[CR] more prominent[CR]statuses in this mod than they were originally) have been[CR] edited to allow[CR]stamina to contribute more significantly toward raising[CR] the amount of HP[CR]restored by the former while now defending against the[CR] latter (originally,[CR]stamina *raised* the damage dealt by sap/poison).[CR] OLD REGEN/SAP[CR]FORMULA[CR] ---------------------[CR] *Tick = ((MaxHP * Stam) / 1024) *[CR](Random Variance)[CR] (*If sap on a player character, tick is halved)[CR] NEW[CR]REGEN FORMULA[CR] -----------------[CR] Tick = ((MaxHP / 32) + Stam) * (Random[CR]Variance)[CR] (NOTE: Random Variance is 87% ~ 99%)[CR] NEW SAP FORMULA[CR]---------------[CR] Tick = (MaxHP / (16 + (Stam / 8)) * (Random Variance)[CR](NOTE: Random Variance is the new formula shown above)[CR] Note that the first[CR]part of the formula is stored in an 8-bit value, and[CR] is thus capped at[CR]255. The minimum value for random variance is 1, so no[CR] regen or sap tick[CR]can exceed 254 (further, because sap damage to player[CR] characters was[CR]originally halved, it could never exceed 127).[CR] Poison Edits Poison works[CR]in a manner similar to sap, except that it only ticks half[CR] as frequently[CR]and each tick deals incrementally more damage. Originally,[CR] the increment[CR]value was equal to the value of the initial tick; we have[CR] halved the[CR]increment value in Brave New World to keep poison from being[CR] too[CR]detrimental of a status (given the lower overall HP totals of player[CR]characters compared to the original game).[CR] Weve also corrected an error[CR](possibly intentional, but I doubt it) in[CR] the original code wherein the[CR]variable that increments with each tick[CR] doesnt reset when the status is[CR]cleared, so poison ticks will now start[CR] back over at the beginning if the[CR]status is re-applied to the same d00d[CR] in the same battle rather than[CR]picking back up where they left off.[CR] Magic Bonus Fixes As a side effect of[CR]the above changes, weve also fixed two other bugs[CR] wherein the "magical[CR]damage +25%" relic property was raising the damage[CR] of sap/poison ticks -[CR]even allowing them to go over the 8-bit cap - and[CR] wasnt being applied to[CR]curative spells. We also thought it a little bit[CR] odd/overpowered that the[CR]magic damage bonuses were stackable whereas the[CR] physical ones were not, so[CR]they no longer are[CR]now.[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Evade Bug Fix Physical and magical evasion now function properly instead of[CR]magical[CR] ------------- evasion covering both types and physical evasion[CR]doing nothing at all.[CR] Seems like a simple enough fix, right?[CR]However...[CR] Status Evasion Fixing the evasion system awakened a dormant[CR]mechanic from deep within[CR] the games code wherein physical attacks will[CR]gain accuracy bonuses or[CR] penalties (+/-25%) if the target has certain[CR]statuses set. Some of these[CR] made sense and were left alone, like how being[CR]slowed, blinded, muddled,[CR] or zombied will now make the afflicted easier to[CR]hit. Others, most oddly[CR] the rerise (AKA "Life 3") status being subject the[CR]same penalty, were[CR] fucking retarded and were thrown in the trash where[CR]they belong.[CR] The big issue, however, wasnt with the accuracy bonuses, but[CR]rather the[CR] penalties when attacking targets affected by the haste, sap,[CR]poison, and[CR] "near fatal" statuses. Not only did none of these make any[CR]sense (except[CR] for haste, but haste is OP enough already), but their[CR]newfound ubiquity[CR] in Brave New World - haste and sap in particular - made[CR]balancing the[CR] physical game hell (and yes, those penalties *stacked*).[CR](Needless to say, the penalties in the above paragraph are now gone.)[CR]Parry and Counter On the flip side to the above, a functional evasion system[CR]combined with[CR] several characters who are very much built for it (Locke and[CR]Shadow come[CR] immediately to mind) rendered the "randomly counters" property[CR]less than[CR] useful since characters could originally only counter attacks[CR]that had[CR] successfully hit them (which in Shadows case usually left him too[CR]dead[CR] to retaliate). We have removed this requirement, thus allowing the[CR]likes[CR] of Locke and Shadow to parry and counter to their hearts[CR]content.[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Evasion% Since evasion and MBlock (magic evasion) max out at 128 instead of[CR]100,[CR] -------- they are no longer represented in-game as a percentage.[CR]Accuracy% For simplicitys sake, the accuracy of all weapons and physical[CR]attacks[CR] made by the enemy (except ones that never miss) have been set to[CR]100%.[CR] The odds of any regular physical attack connecting are thus a[CR]straight[CR] check against the targets evasion (out of 128) while all other[CR]physical[CR] attacks (i.e. those from special commands like Blitz and Bushido)[CR]never[CR] miss* unless the attacker is blind - this is why the printme only[CR]lists[CR] hitrates for magical attacks.[CR] (*Exception: Edgars Autocrossbow,[CR]which behaves like a normal weapon)[CR] And this is where it gets a little[CR]confusing. Because of the presence of[CR] evasion, 100% is only a perfect[CR]hitrate if the targets evasion is zero;[CR] a "true" perfect hitrate is 255%.[CR]And again to keep things as simple as[CR] possible, enemies in Brave New World[CR]do not possess magical evasion.[CR] tl;dr In other words, any (magical)[CR]hitrate shown in the printme is exactly[CR] that if the target is an enemy,[CR]whereas it will be lower against your[CR] characters since they actually[CR]possess magical evasion. Anything without[CR] a hitrate will never miss unless[CR]its a physical attack and the attacker[CR] is blind or if its just a regular[CR]physical attack (i.e.[CR]Fight/Rage).[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Vanish/Doom Fix One of the original games more infamous bugs (and one of the[CR]select few[CR] --------------- to warrant a shitty patch job in all subsequent[CR]releases) related to the[CR] "clear" status circumventing instant death[CR]attacks. This is *properly*[CR] fixed in Brave New World via an external hack[CR]created by Terii Senshi.[CR] "Special" Fix Lesser known (and infinitely less[CR]exploitable) than the above bug is one[CR] where enemy "special" attacks with[CR]the instant death flag would flat-out[CR] ignore death immunity altogether,[CR]vanish or not. The root cause of both[CR] bugs is the roundabout way that the[CR]code treats death as a status, and[CR] the general lack of enemy specials in[CR]the original game that are set to[CR] do so leads me to believe that the[CR]developers had to have been aware of[CR] this bug on at least some level. In[CR]any case, its fixed now.[CR] Overcast Fix Similar to the above, another patch[CR]fixes an issue with an attack called[CR] Overcast forcibly setting zombie on[CR]your party regardless of immunity.[CR] This led to it being impossible to[CR]remedy due to how immunities work in[CR] this game; Overcast now simply no[CR]longer bypasses zombie[CR]immunity.[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Abort On Enemies Failing the old "Vanish/Doom" trick, a vanilla players[CR]primary fallback[CR] ---------------- for any undead enemies (including[CR]bosses) is simply to toss a Phoenix[CR] Down or Revivify on it and call it a[CR]day. My first response to this was[CR] simply to make items unable to target[CR]enemies, but clever players know[CR] that the muddle status can get around[CR]that little fix. That is, it *did*[CR] work until we hard-coded certain things[CR]to not work on enemies at all.[CR] Thing is, quite a few of the games laundry[CR]list of bugs tend to involve[CR] hitting enemies with shit thats not meant to[CR]be used on them, Palidor[CR] being a rather notable offender. Curiously,[CR]theres a targeting flag in[CR] the games code to abort an attack in the event[CR]that it somehow ends up[CR] targeting the party, yet theres no equivalent for[CR]the *enemy* party,[CR] where such a flag is actually needed.[CR] Long story[CR]short, we made an "abort on enemies" flag for shit thats not[CR] supposed to[CR]be used on enemies. And as for shit that is fine to use on[CR] just *regular*[CR]enemies, but not on bosses...[CR] Boss Immunity The "Suplex" byte, which[CR]originally prevented Suplex from targeting[CR] certain enemies (primarily[CR]those of the floating or stationary variety),[CR] is now a hard override to[CR]prevent fractional damage attacks (i.e. Demi,[CR] Quartr) from being cheesed[CR]against bosses. Such attacks originally were[CR] set to miss anything immune[CR]to instant death, so instant death attacks[CR] were thus always preferable.[CR]Fractional damage now deals earth and/or[CR] wind damage and follow suit with[CR]other earth and wind attacks by being[CR] generally very powerful, but unable[CR]to hit a weakness due to a lack of[CR] them (though some enemies still resist[CR]them).[CR] In addition to fractional damage attacks, this flag is also used by[CR]the[CR] Rerise spell (to prevent issues/bugs with bosses that drop items),[CR]and[CR] the Snare dance step (which otherwise disregards death immunity).[CR]And yes, Suplex works on everything now - have fun pile-driving[CR]Kefka.[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Genji Glove Fix Dual-wielding weapons now results in a 25% decrease in damage[CR]from both[CR] --------------- weapons (as it was originally intended to do).[CR]Note that this patch has[CR] been modified from the original version created[CR]by Assassin17 (as noted[CR] in the credits) to only affect regular physical[CR]attacks instead of all[CR] attacks that deal physical damage (i.e. most of[CR]Sabins blitzes).[CR] Dual Wind Slash Another modification to this hack allows[CR]the damage penalty to affect[CR] Wind Slash and Aero when weapons randomly[CR]cast them in place of regular[CR] physical damage. See also the Gauntlet fix[CR]below for more on this.[CR] Dual-Wield Weapons Finally, note that the dual-[CR]wield property is now attached to certain[CR] weapons (see the printme) rather[CR]than to a relic. Any weapon possessing[CR] the dual-wield property allows a[CR]second weapon to be used regardless of[CR] whether or not the second one[CR]allows for it - a sword and dagger combo,[CR] for example, is a valid setup.[CR]The only exception is spears, which are[CR] disallowed in dual-weapon setups[CR](this only affects Mog) because I spent[CR] most of development running my Mog[CR]with a spear/boomerang load-out and[CR] Synchysi thought it was bloody[CR]stupid.[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Gauntlet (Fix?) Holding certain weapons in both hands now increases battle[CR]power by 50%[CR] --------------- rather than 75%. This was done because, as[CR]with the dual-wield property,[CR] two-handed functionality is now applied to[CR]specific weapons rather than[CR] enabled by a relic and the games original[CR]bonus led us to some balance[CR] issues (think "dragoon"). A modified version[CR]of an external hack known[CR] as "Throw Down (part of) The Gauntlet" is also[CR]utilized to allow their[CR] effective battle power to be shown accurately in[CR]the equip menu.[CR] 2-Hand Wind Slash As also with the above hack, a 50%[CR]damage bonus will also apply to Wind[CR] Slash and Aero when two-handed[CR]weapons randomly spark them in place of[CR] regular damage. Combined, these[CR]two allow for a very noticeable balance[CR] between those weapons when used by[CR]Shadow (who typically dual-welds) and[CR] Cyan (who is forced to use both[CR]hands since he cant use a shield).[CR] Two-Handed Weapons Finally, note that[CR]using two hands for weapons that allow it is entirely[CR] optional (except for[CR]Cyan, who as noted above is forced to do so by his[CR] equipment[CR]restrictions). Specifically, giving Edgar or Mog a spear and a[CR] shield[CR](i.e. The SPARTAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! Setup) is allowable even though it[CR] looks[CR]like the game doesnt want to let you do it. To further illustrate[CR] this, an[CR]empty off-hand will now turn yellow (instead of gray) if a two-[CR] handed[CR]weapon is equipped in the other[CR]one.[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Sketch Fix First and foremost, using Sketch should no longer cause the[CR]universe to[CR] ---------- implode on itself thanks to a patch that fixes[CR]whatever in the hell was[CR] wrong with it in the original game. So, theres[CR]that.[CR] Sketch Formula Second, the Sketch formula now uses Relms (or Gogos)[CR]stats instead of[CR] those of the enemy so that its actually worth using.[CR]Brushless Sketch Finally, Sketch is now disallowed unless a brush is equipped[CR]by a patch[CR] called "Brushless Sketch" (which does pretty much the exact[CR]opposite of[CR] what its name suggests) because painting with a knife is[CR]something that[CR] only psychopaths do (which Relm kind of is, come to think[CR]of it).[CR] Brush Targeting Aside from allowing Sketch, the other feature of[CR]paint brushes in Brave[CR] New World is that they now cure HP rather than[CR]damage it (a la the Heal[CR] Rod). The targeting code has been edited so that[CR]they correctly target[CR] your party by default instead of the enemy, and vice[CR]versa in the event[CR] that Relm (or Gogo) is muddled or[CR]bserked.[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Auto-Swordless Runic Similar to the Brushless Sketch patch (both utilize the[CR]same base code,[CR] -------------------- and so Brushless Sketch requires this[CR]one to work), Auto-Swordless Runic[CR] keeps Celes from spamming the ever-[CR]loving shit out of Runic when shes[CR] muddled or at the Colosseum if she[CR]doesnt have a sword to Runic *with*.[CR] Elemental Runic Weve also corrected a[CR]bug wherein Runicd spells would not be stripped[CR] of their elemental[CR]properties, so protection from any element would also[CR] "protect" Celes (or[CR]Gogo) from absorbing the spells MP[CR]cost.[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Persistent Rage Fix So named because the original name is stupid (its made by[CR]the same guy[CR] ------------------- who made Brushless Sketch and Auto-[CR]Swordless Runic... go figure) and not[CR] really descriptive of what the patch[CR]does. What it does is recalculates[CR] resistances whenever Gau dies so that[CR]elemental immunities/weaknesses he[CR] gains through Rage wont persist (and[CR]stack) throughout the battle.[CR] Rage Status Patch This is an extension of[CR]the above written by Think (nATB, many others),[CR] which fixes it to also[CR]affect statuses. The problem with the original[CR] patch was that the[CR]recalculation code does not remove statuses that you[CR] are immune to because[CR]the code basically interprets status immunity as[CR] "cannot be toggled on or[CR]off". Thus, characters who are given statuses[CR] like safe or haste by their[CR]equipment, or in this case by Rage, are then[CR] considered by the game to be[CR]"immune" to those statuses.[CR] This patch does two things to correct the[CR]above issue. First, it strips[CR] characters of any status that isnt provided[CR]by their equipment whenever[CR] resistances are recalculated (i.e. when they[CR]die). Second, whenever Gau[CR] enters the rage status, he is purged of all[CR]statuses that his rage gives[CR] him immunity to (*actual* immunity, not[CR]"inherent" immunity). Note that[CR] in addition to preventing Gau from being[CR]stuck with status ailments that[CR] he cant cure, this also fixes an exploit[CR]where raging a monster that[CR] absorbs poison damage (all of whom resist the[CR]poison status in Brave New[CR] World) with the poison status set basically[CR]gave you regen on[CR]steroids.[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Leap Anywhere The "Leap" command can now be used on any rageable formation,[CR]regardless[CR] ------------- of whether or not you are on the Veldt. While[CR]this does give Gau earlier[CR] access to some key rages in certain areas, its[CR]largely a QoL patch that[CR] makes it easier to collect all of his rages.[CR]Unlike before, Leap no longer ends the current battle. Rather, it will[CR]remove Gau from the party for its duration (hes counted as dead for the[CR]purpose of what happens if the rest of your party wipes); he will learn[CR]the rages of the enemy party whether or not you win the fight or[CR]run.[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Smart Cover This fixes the "protect allies" effect to behave more[CR]intelligently than[CR] ----------- before. Primarily, it disables blocking[CR]attacks that originate from your[CR] own team under most circumstances, which[CR]has the significant benefit of[CR] preventing party members from being[CR]"protected" from Relm trying to heal[CR] them with a brush.[CR]Muddled/Zombied/Charmed characters will be allowed to[CR] hit themselves, but[CR]not their teammates. One notably important change in[CR] light of the fact[CR]that characters can now cover non-critical allies (see[CR] "Tank and Spank[CR]above) is that cover will no longer activate on a counter-[CR] attack from an[CR]enemy - only proactive strikes.[CR] Cover is also disabled under the the[CR]following other conditions:[CR] If bodyguard has... If target has...[CR] Blind[CR]Image[CR] Bserk Magitek[CR] Image Death (*)[CR] Magitek Stone (*)[CR] Muddle[CR](unchanged) Zombie (*)[CR] Sleep (unchanged) Clear (unchanged)[CR] Death[CR](unchanged)[CR] Stone (unchanged)[CR] Zombie (unchanged)[CR] Clear[CR](unchanged)[CR] *This game was programmed by monkeys, I swear[CR] Finally,[CR]cover is disabled entirely if Golem is active, and attacks that[CR] would be[CR]nullified/absorbed by the intended target are also not[CR]blocked.[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Impology Imp was always one of the more misunderstood statuses in the[CR]original[CR] -------- game, mainly since it wasnt very up-front about what it[CR]did and even it[CR] seemed to not have a very good idea about it was trying to[CR]be. It was a[CR] weird offensive debuff/mute hybrid that didnt even behave the[CR]same way[CR] on enemies as it did on your party. And dont even get me[CR]*started* on[CR] how buggy the animation was/is.[CR] Now, imp is a simple[CR]output debuff: 50% off everything, both offensively[CR] and healing-wise. Its[CR]basically the exact opposite of Morph (see below)[CR] except that it doesnt[CR]affect incoming damage. Attacks and spells with[CR] fixed or fractional damage[CR]are also unaffected, but the imp penalty does[CR] apply to some things that[CR]you wouldnt expect it to like items and regen[CR] and sap/poison ticks (this[CR]is explained a bit more in the next[CR]section).[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Morphology Terras Morph ability is now a toggled stance rather than a timed[CR]one.[CR] ---------- Rather than doubling her offensive output and halving all[CR]magical damage[CR] taken, it now boosts her output by 50% at the expense of[CR]doubling *all*[CR] damage taken. This damage penalty is reduced by 1/128 for[CR]each point of[CR] stamina that Terra has, down to a minimum of 25% at 96[CR]stamina.[CR] Its important to note that the 50% output boost from Morph[CR]applies to[CR] pretty much everything. The Morph bonus is added to damage[CR]calculation[CR] as a "multiplier", which in the original game are ignored by[CR]any attack[CR] that ignores defense. This is no longer true - defense-ignoring[CR]spells[CR] and abilities now respect multipliers*. This includes curative[CR]spells,[CR] which ignore defense as an obvious necessity. Because the games[CR]code is[CR] weird, the Morph multiplier will also be applied to items that[CR]restore a[CR] set amount of HP/MP (i.e. Dried Meat), but not to items like[CR]Tonics or[CR] Ethers that restore fractional amounts - apparently, beef jerky[CR]is 50%[CR] more delicious when a naked pink lady is cramming it down your[CR]gob.[CR] (*Exception: the Flare spell is hard-coded to ignore damage[CR]multipliers)[CR] On the subject of healing, the above-mentioned damage penalty[CR]does not[CR] distinguish between incoming damage and incoming healing -[CR]everything[CR] will hit her for higher numbers (except for fixed or fractional[CR]values).[CR] This means that, although Terra will be more fragile in her esper[CR]state,[CR] shell also be much easier to heal. Where things start to get[CR]confusing[CR] is sap and regen ticks, which receive the damage multiplier from[CR]Morph[CR] because the game considers those things to be Terra hitting herself.[CR]For[CR] that same reason, however, their numbers are also boosted by the[CR]penalty[CR] that doubles all incoming damage. This means that the same stat[CR]which[CR] raises the strength of her regen ticks in the first place will in[CR]fact[CR] *lower* the boost they get from Morph, making the whole mess a[CR]wash.[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Atma and Omega Due to the lower overall levels that everyone will achieve in[CR]this mod,[CR] ------------ the special damage formula used by the Atma (and[CR]now Omega) Weapon ends[CR] up nerfing the ever-loving shit out of it since it[CR]assumes a "baseline"[CR] level of 64(!). To remedy this problem, its formula[CR]has been gutted:[CR] OLD ATMA WEAPON FORMULA[CR] -----------------------[CR]1. Normal attack (ignores defense)[CR] 2. Dmg = Dmg * Lv[CR] 3. Dmg = Dmg *[CR]((HP / 256) + 1) / ((MaxHP / 256) + 1)[CR] 4. Dmg = (Dmg / 64) + 1[CR] NEW[CR]ATMA WEAPON FORMULA[CR] -----------------------[CR] 1. Normal attack (ignores[CR]defense) w/ stamina in place of vigor[CR] 2. Dmg = Dmg * ((HP / 256) + 1) /[CR]((MaxHP / 256) + 1)[CR] Bserk ITD Boost As mentioned in the above hack[CR]description, all defense-ignoring attacks[CR] now respect damage multipliers.[CR]Aside from Morph, the only other effect[CR] that change has is that defense-[CR]ignoring weapons are now boosted by the[CR] bserk status, where previously[CR]they were not(*). Its also worth noting[CR] that the Atma/Omega Weapon is[CR]still stripped of its special formula and[CR] treated like a normal weapon[CR]with 255 BatPwr if you use it with Mug or[CR] Jump, which may or may not be[CR]desirable depending on your situation.[CR] *Theres an actually an exception[CR](Setzers Dice) since FF6 was coded by[CR] monkeys, but its not really[CR]important and I dont think anyone[CR]cares[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]MP 4 Crits Weapons that consume MP for automatic critical hits now cost an[CR]amount[CR] ---------- equal to 1/2 the users level rather than [12...19]. This[CR]is important[CR] primarily because auto-crits are now a standard feature on[CR]rods to take[CR] advantage of an oddity in the games code that causes random[CR]spellcasts[CR] from them to also do critical damage - something that spells[CR]ordinarily[CR] cannot do. Combined with a new equipment feature which doubles[CR]the odds[CR] of a random spellcast occurring (from 25% to 50%), this allows[CR]rods to[CR] function as perfectly viable weapons for magically-inclined[CR]characters.[CR] A major caveat to the above, however, is that random spellcast[CR]damage is[CR] affected by row and 3/4 of BNWs rod users die in a gentle[CR]breeze. This[CR] can be bypassed with the Jump command, and random spellcast[CR]damage will[CR] receive the 50% damage boost from jumping, but the downside is[CR]that Jump[CR] also disables critical hits and critical hits have a higher[CR]damage boost[CR] (100%) than jumping with a rod does (Jump only provides the[CR]same damage[CR] boost as a critical hit when you do it with a spear).[CR] An[CR]astute reader may recognize the above bonuses as damage multipliers,[CR] and[CR]no doubt many of you are thinking (judging by the number of times I[CR] get[CR]asked this) that bserk would be the *perfect* way to boost your rod[CR] users[CR]damage. Except its not. Despite the fact that random spellcasts[CR] benefit[CR]from every *other* damage multiplier (MP-fueled criticals, Jump,[CR] Morph),[CR]BSERK DOES NOT AFFECT RANDOM SPELLCASTS. Blame Squaresoft.[CR] Spoil The Rod[CR]Speaking of poor coding practices, using a rod (or shield) as an item in[CR]the original game would cause the resulting spell to deal massive damage[CR]because all items are coded to ignore damage modifiers, namely defense.[CR]This has been fixed so that spells cast from rods used as items will do[CR]the same damage that they would have had the character cast it normally.[CR]Quartr/Doom Crits Because the random spellcasts on the Quartrstaff and[CR]Doomstick dont do[CR] "regular" damage, they are not affected by the[CR]bugs/"features" mentioned[CR] above. Thus, this hack allows Quartr to affect[CR]all enemies when randomly[CR] cast from an MP-fueled critical hit (it would[CR]normally only affect the[CR] target of the rod attack) while the Doomstick[CR]will instead cast X-Zone[CR] (rather than Doom) on a group of enemies under[CR]the same circumstances.[CR] Sword Crits Conversely to the above, the Holy and[CR]Flare spells are hard-coded *not*[CR] to deal critical damage when randomly[CR]cast from the Illumina/Apocalypse.[CR] More specifically, they are hard-coded[CR]to ignore damage multipliers to[CR] keep the Apocalypse/Illumina from being[CR]overwhelmingly OP; Flare not[CR] getting the Morph damage boost as a result is[CR]an unfortunate casualty.[CR] Always Load MP The game now always loads[CR]characters MP at the start of battle, even if[CR] the Magic command is not[CR]present. This allows Gogo to use his MP for rod[CR] attacks without needing[CR]Magic (or Lore) set as a command. It also has an[CR] unintended side effect of[CR]doing the same for Banon and the rod-wielding[CR] moogles in the opening[CR]battle to save Terra from the guards, although[CR] none of them possess enough[CR]MP for more than one critical hit.[CR] Always Halve MP The "MP for crits"[CR]property now respects the "1/2 MP costs" flag on the[CR] Gem Box/Soul[CR]Box.[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Random Number Good FF6s notoriously streaky Random Number Generator has been[CR]replaced with[CR] ------------------ a new one that wipes clean without[CR]leaving any streaks behind. Note that[CR] this is an updated version of the[CR]one that existed in previous versions[CR] of the mod (1.6 and prior) that adds[CR]in an extra layer of randomness to[CR] prevent/discourage RNG manipulation. As[CR]you could expect, this affects[CR] the games entire combat system to some[CR]extent, as well as many of the[CR] other hacks on this list (i.e. the ones[CR]concerning the odds of things).[CR] For example...[CR] Rage and Dance Odds The[CR]two attacks on each rage are now common (2/3 odds of being used) and[CR]uncommon (1/3 odds) instead of it being an even 50/50 chance. Similarly,[CR]the 2nd and 3rd steps of each dance now have 5/16 and 3/16 odds instead[CR] of[CR]6/16 and 2/16 (respectively). Both of these changes combine with an[CR]overhaul of the attacks involved, because diversity (its a thing now).[CR]Image Nerf The image status (also known as "blink") now has a 1/3 chance of[CR]being[CR] dispelled each time it blocks a physical attack (instead of[CR]1/4).[CR] Formation Odds The appearance probabilities of the last two enemy[CR]formations in a pack[CR] have been changed from 5/16 and 1/16 to 3/16 (each).[CR]This allows for a[CR] greater variety of enemy encounters, particularly in[CR]larger areas.[CR] Odds and Ends Finally, see below for a list of all random[CR]weapon and ability procs:[CR] RANDOM EFFECT ODDS[CR] ------------- ----[CR]Randomly casts spell 25% (50% w/ boost)[CR] Randomly hits as Wind Slash/Aero[CR]50%[CR] Randomly sets Stop/Slow (Kagenui) 50%[CR] Anti-Floating weapons*[CR]50%[CR] Anti-Undead weapons* 50% (undead only)[CR] Randomly kills 25% (100% if[CR]undead)[CR] Randomly cleaves/crits* (Zantetsuken) 25%[CR] Randomly steals[CR](Switchblade) 50%[CR] Randomly jumps twice (Dragon Helm) 25%[CR] Randomly sets[CR]"Stone" (Dragon bushido) 66%[CR] Randomly sets "Image" (Mirage) 50%[CR] *See[CR]"Random Weapon Effects" below for[CR]details[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Random Weapon Effects Several of the games "random" weapon effects have been[CR]modified in some[CR] --------------------- form or fashion, including...[CR]Zantetsuken The random "cleave" proc on the Zantetsuken now deals a critical[CR]hit to[CR] anything thats immune to instant death, thus increasing its[CR]usefulness[CR] against enemies other than trash mobs. As an interesting side-[CR]note, this[CR] wont prevent ordinary critical attacks from occurring,[CR]resulting in a[CR] 1/128 chance of a *double* critical hit.[CR] Chainsaw[CR]Massacre Similar to the above, the random "hockey mask" proc on the Chainsaw[CR]was[CR] altered so that the instant death effect is in addition to damage[CR]dealt[CR] rather than instead of it. Note that this is referred to as "cleave"[CR]in[CR] the printme even though it doesnt have the "cut into pieces"[CR]animation[CR] like the Zantetsuken or Cyans titular bushido do. This is in[CR]order to[CR] distinguish it from "randomly kills" property that heals undead[CR]enemies[CR] instead of killing them to (re)death.[CR] Anti-Undead Weapons Also[CR]distinct from "randomly kills" is the brand-new anti-undead feature[CR] on the[CR]Demonsbane shortsword and Setzers Tarot cards, described in-game[CR] simply as[CR]"strong vs. undead foes". What you get here is a 50% chance of[CR] instant[CR]death similar to "randomly kills", except that it only works on[CR] the[CR]undead. If the target is an undead *boss*, then it will instead deal[CR]critical damage (similar to how the Zantetsuken now works).[CR] Anti-Air[CR]Weapons Weapons with the "randomly throws" property (renamed to "strong[CR]against[CR] floating enemies" to avoid confusion with weapons that can be used[CR]with[CR] the "Throw" command) originally received a damage boost of 50%[CR]against[CR] non-floating enemies and 200% (triple damage) on floating ones[CR]when they[CR] were randomly "thrown". This large discrepancy rendered them a[CR]bit *too*[CR] powerful in the situations where they were useful and a bit too[CR]useless[CR] otherwise, and so the damage boost for grounded enemies has been[CR]raised[CR] to 100% and their battle powers have been re-balanced[CR]accordingly.[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]The X-Fight Effect The "Offering" effect, which is now on a Setzer-exclusive[CR]relic and a[CR] ------------------ Shadow-exclusive weapon, is set to make[CR]"Fight" a 2x targetable attack[CR] with a 25% damage penalty instead of a 4x[CR]untargetable attack with a 50%[CR] damage penalty. This was edited because[CR]Setzer possesses several weapons[CR] that either ignore the penalty (Dice) or[CR]otherwise dont rely on direct[CR] damage to be effective (Tarot, Doom Darts).[CR]On Shadows end, the damage[CR] penalty is ignored by the random Wind[CR]Slash/Aero procs of the Kazekiri[CR] and Mutsunokami, as well as the random[CR]spellcasts of the Sakura.[CR] Note that the new "X-Fight" also lacks three[CR]little-known properties of[CR] the original: it does not set attacks to "cant[CR]be dodged", it does not[CR] disable critical hits, and it no longer disables[CR]random spellcasts.[CR] X-Magic Counter The X-Magic command is now[CR]uninterrupted so that its no longer possible[CR] to provoke two counter-[CR]attacks from the same target with[CR]it.[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Throw Effects Weapons now retain special properties when used with "Throw",[CR]namely the[CR] ------------- "2x damage to humans" property of the Butterfly[CR]and Man Eater knives.[CR] (For those of you who are curious how Throw[CR]determines its damage, its[CR] basically a regular attack with the weapon[CR]being thrown that ignores the[CR] users row, the targets defense, and is given[CR]a 100% damage boost.)[CR] Gogo Throw Gogo can now still use Throw even if[CR]Shadow is no longer[CR]available.[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Bushido Blade Physical-damage bushido techniques (Dispatch, Flurry, and[CR]Tempest) now[CR] ------------- rely exclusively on the power of the equipped[CR]sword to determine their[CR] strength; their power levels are set to a given[CR]fraction of the users[CR] Battle Power (refer to the printme for[CR]specifics).[CR] SwordTech Charger Bushido (AKA "SwdTech") no longer takes a[CR]bloody lifetime to charge up[CR] (charge speed will increase as more[CR]techniques are[CR]learned).[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Treasure Hunting Steal/Mug no longer takes the level of the "treasure hunter"[CR]or victim[CR] ---------------- into consideration and is now just a straight-[CR]up roll against the RNG[CR] that uses the "hunter"s speed (% of success = (112[CR]+ Speed * 2) / 255).[CR] Speed also affects the likelihood of a rare steal[CR](Speed / 256) instead[CR] of the flat 1/8 chance in the original game, making[CR]them more common in[CR] the later game with a little bit of investment in[CR]Lockes speed.[CR] Quicksteal Further to the above, successful steal attempts[CR]are now treated by the[CR] game as a "free" action and will immediately refill[CR]the ATB gauge of the[CR] character who performed it (note that this also[CR]applies to random steal[CR] attempts made by a certain knife). This allows the[CR]"Mug" command to act[CR] as a multi-attack rather than just a regular one plus[CR]a theft attempt.[CR] Two Legs Good Finally, as I mentioned earlier, treasure[CR]hunting has been standardized[CR] so that only humanoid enemies have items for[CR]the taking. This not only[CR] made it easier for me to balance stealables[CR]since I had far fewer foes[CR] to work with, but it should also make it much[CR]easier for players to[CR] figure out which enemies are worth the effort to[CR]hunt[CR]from.[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Slot De-Rigging The Slots command is no longer rigged to force certain[CR]outcomes based on[CR] --------------- how the RNG is feeling - its now[CR]entirely timing-based, and the reels[CR] have been edited to group the symbols[CR]together, FF7-style:[CR] REEL 1 REEL 2 REEL 3[CR] ------ ------ ------[CR] 7 7[CR]7[CR] Bar Bar Bar[CR] Chocobo Blackjack Diamond[CR] Chocobo Blackjack[CR]Diamond[CR] Chocobo Blackjack Diamond[CR] Bar Bar Bar[CR] Bar Bar Bar[CR]Diamond Chocobo Blackjack[CR] Diamond Chocobo Blackjack[CR] Diamond Chocobo[CR]Blackjack[CR] Bar Bar Bar[CR] Bar Bar Bar[CR] Blackjack Diamond Chocobo[CR]Blackjack Diamond Chocobo[CR] Blackjack Diamond Chocobo[CR] Bar Bar Bar[CR]The two other changes worthy of note are that the Bar-Bar-7 "fuck you"[CR]spin has been disabled and Bar-Bar-Bar no longer forcibly passes over[CR] Odin[CR]as a potential random esper to be summoned.[CR] A list of Slots results and[CR]their effects can be found in the[CR]printme.[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Make It Rain The formula for GP Toss (AKA "GP Rain") has been reworked to not[CR]only[CR] ------------ make it an attack worth actually using, but to tempt an[CR]alternate build[CR] for your Setzer as the new formula quite strongly[CR]considers his stamina.[CR] OLD GP RAIN FORMULA[CR] -------------------[CR] GP[CR]Rained = Lv * 30[CR] Dmg = (GP Rained * 2) / # of foes[CR] NEW GP TOSS[CR]FORMULA[CR] -------------------[CR] GP Tossed = Stam * 10[CR] Dmg = (GP Tossed[CR]* Lv) / (2 * (# of targets + 1))[CR] Further, GP Toss has been designated as a[CR]"free targeting" attack (press[CR] L/R to target multiple foes) instead of[CR]being forcibly multi-targeted.[CR] This is a particularly important feature[CR]for GP Toss given its special[CR] damage split formula that penalizes damage[CR]output for every target hit[CR] rather than the flat 50% penalty used by all[CR](most) other[CR]attacks.[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Umaro Hit Hard Umaro has four attacks: a regular "Fight" attack and three[CR]special ones,[CR] -------------- two of which are enabled by specific relics.[CR]If you count the fact that[CR] his base stats and the battle power of his Bone[CR]Club have been adjusted,[CR] all four of them have been tweaked and/or fixed[CR]by this mod:[CR] ..."Tackle", which is always available, is basically just his[CR]regular[CR] fight command set to ignore defense. Because Umaros base battle[CR]power[CR] combined with that of his weapon give his regular attacks a maxed-[CR]out[CR] battle power of 255, this is basically his equivalent of Bum Rush.[CR]..."Rage", the "character toss" ability thats enabled by the Rage Belt,[CR]was initially just Tackle (a regular attack that ignores defense) set to[CR]add the battle power of the character being tossed to Umaros. However,[CR]since battle power is an 8-bit value (read: it caps at 255), this didnt[CR]end up being as significant as it was probably meant to be. It now has a[CR]set battle power of 255 (see above) with the "Gauntlet" bonus applied to[CR]it for an effective battle power of 382. Further, it now deals critical[CR]damage if the character thrown is Mog (as it was originally intended to[CR]do, but didnt due to a bug). As always, Umaro will prioritize throwing[CR]allies with the sleep or muddle statuses, as this attack removes them.[CR]..."Blizzard" (formerly "Storm"), which the Blizzard Orb relic enables,[CR] no[CR]longer does half damage (AKA "split loss") if more than one target is[CR]present. Its power has been lowered *slightly* (100 -&gt; 90), but Umaros[CR]stats more than make up for that. Note that this is the same "Blizzard"[CR]attack that appears in the Snowman Jazz dance (refer to the printme for[CR]details) with two notable distinctions. One, it uses Umaros stamina to[CR]determine its damage rather than his (rather abysmal) magic power. Two,[CR] it[CR]bypasses the enemy stamina check to see whether or not it sets slow.[CR]Attack Odds The odds of each attack being used have also been adjusted.[CR]Previously,[CR] they varied depending on whether Umaro had one or both of his[CR]special[CR] relics equipped - having both on was often undesirable as the odds[CR]of[CR] Rage or Storm being used were higher if only their one special relic[CR]was[CR] equipped. To simplify things, all three of Umaros special attacks[CR]now[CR] have a hard 76/255 (roughly 30%) chance of being used, otherwise[CR]Umaro[CR] will use his regular fight command. This gives fight a 179/255[CR]chance[CR] (roughly 70%) of being used if neither special relic is present,[CR]103/255[CR] odds (or 40%) if one is equipped, and 27/255 (10%) if both[CR]are.[CR] Bare Naked Yeti Finally, Umaros equip menu is no longer locked down[CR]so that you can now[CR] (un)equip him just like a normal character. Of course,[CR]he still has zero[CR] options aside from what he starts out with - this change[CR]was made purely[CR] to correct a bug in the original game wherein the "unequip[CR]all of your[CR] d00ds" dude wouldnt take Umaros relics away since it would[CR]also remove[CR] his other equipment (that youd then have no way to get back on[CR]him).[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Defend Buff The "defend" battle command now halves both physical and magical[CR]damage[CR] ----------- instead of just physical damage. This is a rather[CR]important hack for the[CR] crazies who are trying for a level one Gogo (and[CR]yes, its been[CR]done).[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Status Display This is a collection of hacks that greatly improve how the game[CR]conveys[CR] -------------- the presence of status effects in battle to the[CR]player.[CR] Status Auras Removes the glowing auras from the safe, shell, and[CR]reflect statuses.[CR] Because only one aura can be displayed at a time,[CR]buffing your party to[CR] any significant degree otherwise quickly devolves[CR]into a confusing mass[CR] of bright colors wherein only the status with the[CR]highest priority will[CR] be displayed. The three statuses which are still[CR]represented with auras[CR] are either unable to coexist on the same target[CR](haste and slow) or will[CR] otherwise completely override the other two for[CR]its duration (stop).[CR] Targeting Panel When choosing a friendly target for[CR]an item or spell in battle, a panel[CR] appears to display any status effect[CR]present on each character. Similar[CR] to the problem with auras, only one[CR]status could be displayed here at a[CR] time and the order in which the 25(!)[CR]possible results were prioritized[CR] was questionable at best. This panel now[CR]displays *only* the presence of[CR] any combination of the safe, shell, and[CR]reflect statuses.[CR] Rerise On ATB So, that list of 25 possible status[CR]effects I mentioned a second ago?[CR] Well, rerise (AKA "Life 3") is dead[CR]fucking last on the priority list -[CR] strange, given that it has absolutely[CR]no visual indication unlike, say,[CR] float, muddle, blink, imp... or[CR]literally everything else that will take[CR] precedence over it being shown.[CR]Its almost like this game was coded by[CR] idiots or something.[CR] The[CR]presence of the rerise status on a party member is now indicated by[CR] their[CR]ATB bar turning green while charging (it still turns yellow when[CR] full).[CR]Needless to say, the effects of this change are lost if the ATB[CR] gauge is[CR]disabled in the config menu.[CR] Status Scan Finally, since enemies arent[CR]exactly as forthcoming about their current[CR] status as your characters are,[CR]the Scan spell will now display all of a[CR] targets status effects has in[CR]addition to its weaknesses. This can be[CR] useful, for example, for figuring[CR]out whether or not you remembered to[CR] put Slow on a boss (or for figuring[CR]out why Slow wont work[CR]it).[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]HP/MP Text Color Text coloration in battle will now change to indicate MP[CR]damage (red) or[CR] ---------------- healing (blue). A side effect of this[CR]patch is that it also alters the[CR] color of the "reflect" shield when[CR]attacks are bounced off of it due to[CR] the fact that the MP healing is[CR]piggybacking off of the same palette as[CR] reflect uses. This also means that[CR]the MP healing font is susceptible to[CR] the same little-known bug as reflect[CR]wherein the coloring gets fucked up[CR] for the duration of any fight in which[CR]Crusader is summoned.[CR] Bad Decoration This fixes the Crusader redecorates[CR]reflect barriers[CR]bug.[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Original Graphics Restores the following sprites to their original[CR](uncensored) versions:[CR] -----------------[CR] Siren[CR] Goddess[CR]Chadarnook[CR] Critic[CR] Barb-E/Madam/Dahling[CR] (Note that most of these[CR]have been renamed)[CR] This hack is omitted from the "clean" version of Brave[CR]New[CR]World.[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]New Window Style Added a new window style as the default one, with the old[CR]default style[CR] ---------------- replacing #8 (which was used only by[CR]assholes and mental[CR]patients).[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Menu Item Sorting Using the "arrange" command in the inventory now sorts item[CR]types in a[CR] ----------------- manner that actually makes some fucking[CR]sense:[CR] NEW ORDER: OLD ORDER:[CR] -------------- --------------[CR] Tool[CR]Dagger[CR] Throwing Star Sword[CR] Ninja Scroll Spear[CR] Dagger Katana[CR]Sword Rod[CR] Spear Brush[CR] Claw Throwing Star[CR] Katana "Other" Weapon[CR]Casino Weapon Casino Weapon[CR] Rod Claw[CR] Brush Shield[CR] "Other" Weapon[CR]Helmet[CR] Shield Armor[CR] Helmet Tool[CR] Armor Ninja Scroll[CR] Relic[CR]Relic[CR] Alphabetical Rage In addition to all of the other changes weve made[CR]to make Rage the best[CR] skill it can be, weve also utilized a patch that[CR]sorts all of his rages[CR] alphabetically instead of by their order in the[CR]code. Another new patch[CR] condenses the list of rages in the skills submenu[CR]to use only the first[CR] 64 slots (the total number of rages in BNW) instead[CR]of all 256.[CR] Alphabetical Lore Lores are also listed alphabetically now, as[CR]well as condensed in the[CR] menu. Neither of these are due to a hack, however[CR]- I just manually[CR] re-arranged them in the spell index.[CR] Compact Spell[CR]List Finally, the "magic" menu for each character is now condensed in[CR]battle[CR] to remove the empty spaces that previously existed due to the[CR]nature of[CR] how the code dynamically generated the lists of known[CR]spells.[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Obscure Menu Hacks This is a collection of lesser-visible edits to the menu[CR]screen.[CR] ------------------[CR] Overlay and MP Costs This removes the small[CR]overlay which identifies the skill submenus (i.e.[CR] Espers, Spells,[CR]Bushido...) because it was unnecessary and it obscured[CR] the lower-right[CR]portion of the information panel above it (the mod makes[CR] use of this real[CR]estate whereas vanilla did not). The only useful piece[CR] of information that[CR]appeared in this overlay was the MP cost of a chosen[CR] spell; spell costs[CR]are now visible by default in the main menu panel.[CR] (I say "by default"[CR]above because a little-known feature of the original[CR] game is that you can[CR]press "Y" in the spell menu to toggle MP costs in[CR] the main panel; whats[CR]shown by default is the spell percentage learned,[CR] which isnt exactly[CR]useful/relevant information in Brave New World.)[CR] Esper Equip Screen[CR]Speaking of little-known features in the original game, a summary of the[CR]partys equipment can be viewed by selecting the equip or relic menu[CR]options, pressing L/R to select the entire party, and then pressing left[CR]on the D-pad. This screen has been edited in our mod to also show your[CR]equipped espers, since theyre now an important part of your load-out.[CR] Y[CR]Equip Relics Quickly switch between the equip and relic menus with the "Y"[CR]button.[CR] Unequipium This fixes a bug wherein characters max HP/MP values[CR]would not update[CR] after removing equipment that boosts it until they were[CR]in active party,[CR] leading to incorrect values being shown on the party[CR]creation screen.[CR] Blitz Screen Blitz names are now displayed in the menu[CR]instead of just the inputs.[CR] Yellow Streak Fix This removes the small[CR]yellow line that appears in Gogos command[CR]menu.[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Optimize/Hotswap Ban Because the "optimize" command only considers raw[CR]defense/battle power,[CR] -------------------- its generally a poor judge of[CR]usefulness - especially given the many[CR] other benefits that most equipment[CR]now has. This is the *actual* reason[CR] for disabling the command, although[CR]our justification is that it didnt[CR] play nicely with the "dual wield"[CR]property on weapons.[CR] The other function that didnt jibe well with baking[CR]the "dual-wield"[CR] property into weapons was the ability to swap out them[CR]and/or shields in[CR] mid-battle. Unlike optimize, which we were all too glad[CR]to take out back[CR] and put down, we were actually kind of sad to see this[CR]one go. Not sad[CR] enough to try and fix it, mind, but still kind of sad[CR]nonetheless.[CR] Optimize Fix The only instances in Brave New World where the[CR]optimize code is still[CR] used are when Edgar and Terra are force-equipped[CR]when they re-join you[CR] immediately prior to boss battles, and we utilized[CR]an external patch to[CR] prevent it from doing shit like making Edgar wear a[CR]drill as a hat.[CR] (Also, it no longer ignores the Blood Sword and Soul[CR]Sabre.)[CR] Shop Display In the same spirit as axing optimize because weapons[CR]and armor are now[CR] much more than their primary stats, so too have we done[CR]away with the[CR] symbols that appear when buying equipment that compares it[CR]to what you[CR] already have equipped. Again, since only raw battle[CR]power/defense was[CR] considered, we felt that the partial information it[CR]provided was worse[CR] than none at all. Players are encouraged to use the[CR]printme to look up[CR] information about equipment or, failing that, the[CR]extended information[CR] panel in your inventory screen (double-click on a[CR]piece of equipment to[CR] display who can use it, then press left on your[CR]D-pad to see its[CR]stats).[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Rewards Display The Colosseum menu now displays the prize for any item wagered[CR]without[CR] --------------- having to commit to the wager beforehand.[CR] Note[CR]that the Colosseum has been completely reworked and standardized to[CR] make[CR]it more obvious/intuitive what items can be wagered to win fabulous[CR] prizes[CR]and what will simply earn you a date with Mr. Chupon. Simply put,[CR] any item[CR]with no resale value is considered rare and can be bet at the[CR] Colosseum -[CR]everything else is not rare and wins you literally[CR]nothing.[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]MP Party Restore The "choose a party screen" now restores the MP of all[CR]characters to max[CR] ---------------- instead of just HP. This was done[CR]primarily to act as a full party heal[CR] prior to the Battle of Narshe,[CR]though its also a good convenience hack.[CR] Not only does it remove the need[CR]to visit an inn after swapping out your[CR] team, but it also affects picking[CR]a character to fight in the[CR]Colosseum.[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]NoGainz There is now an option in the config menu to disable exp. gains (and,[CR]by[CR] ------- extension, spell point and EP gains) from battle. This feature[CR]is mostly[CR] intended for challenge gamers trying a low-level game, but can[CR]also be[CR] useful for someone who just wants to farm for GP without over-[CR]leveling.[CR] (NOTE: this option is NOT a challenge to the size of your penis.[CR]Anyone[CR] who leaves this option on and then bitches to us about how hard the[CR]mod[CR] is will be laughed at/ridiculed and then told to gain a fucking[CR]level.)[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Get Back Here, Shadow! Shadow wont randomly run off on you anymore at any[CR]point during Sabins[CR] ---------------------- scenario or if you hire him in[CR]Kohlingen. Hes also kind enough now to[CR] leave all of his shit behind when[CR]he leaves you at Baren Falls.[CR] Zozo Unequip Further to the above, everyone[CR]is force-unequipped after the scene with[CR] Ramuh at Zozo so that nobody[CR](Shadow &gt;.&gt;) runs off with your shit. Note[CR] that, with this change, THERE[CR]ARE NO MORE INSTANCES OF SOMEONE RUNNING[CR] OFF WITH ANY OF YOUR STUFF, so[CR]dont worry about it anymore, k?[CR] Scenario Unequip In a similar, though less[CR]severe case of the above, Locke and Celes are[CR] now unequipped at the end of[CR]their scenario. This removes the incentive[CR] to put it off until last since[CR]it no longer "locks" your best equipment[CR] into two characters you wont be[CR]seeing again for a little while.[CR] Arvis Unequip Finally, Arvis is now an[CR]unequip dude following the Battle of Narshe, so[CR] you dont have to go to the[CR]trouble of forming a party of everyone whos[CR] *not* going to Zozo just so[CR]you can take all of their shit[CR]off.[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]B Button Dash Obsoletes Sprint Shoes by adding a dash button (B). Note that[CR]this patch[CR] ------------- has been modified from the original version to[CR]disallow dashing during[CR] the following points in the game where dashing was[CR]originally disabled:[CR] The opening sequence (Magitek raid on Narshe)[CR] Any[CR]*other* time youre wearing Magitek armor)[CR] The "Save Terra" sequence (the[CR]moogle battle)[CR] The Battle of Narshe[CR] Celess opera solo[CR] Daryls Tomb[CR](the stair/flashback sequence)[CR] This patch has also been *further* modified[CR]to replace the now-useless[CR] optimize/empty slot in the config menu with the[CR]option to make running[CR] the default speed (where holding B will make you[CR]walk at normal speed).[CR] Fancy Walking Characters now continue taking poison[CR]damage whilst walking diagonally[CR] (i.e. up or down stairs), whereas they[CR]originally[CR]didnt.[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Save and Restore In response to the fact that the ability to save the game at[CR]any time is[CR] -------------- a feature of the software required to play this[CR]mod in the first place,[CR] we made the active decision to shift Brave New[CR]Worlds difficulty model[CR] away from save denial (which, frankly, died out[CR]with blast processing)[CR] and more toward inventory management with the[CR]following changes:[CR] Several save points have been added to key areas[CR]Some save points are now also "full recovery" points[CR] Tents and sleeping[CR]bags have been removed from the game[CR] In short, recovery items are now more[CR]important since you cant just pop[CR] a tent just before every boss fight, and[CR]saving the game is a tool meant[CR] to prevent you from losing huge amounts of[CR]time to fuckups. To that end,[CR] the time-honored advice of "save early and[CR]often" holds true becuase...[CR] Game Over, Man! Death in battle now kicks you[CR]back to the menu screen instead of to your[CR] last save. This was done[CR]because, while this would retain all experience[CR] gained, it would not[CR]retain any esper boosts (and thats[CR]bad).[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]5. BUGS and KNOWN[CR]ISSUES[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]During certain battles, most notably the Cranes, the menu cursor will become[CR]difficult to see or[CR] disappear entirely - this is an emulator issue and has[CR]absolutely nothing to do with the mod[CR] (ditto for off-screen characters[CR]appearing layered over the HUD during in-battle cutscenes)[CR] Another[CR]emulator-specific issue involves the battle interface randomly "flashing"[CR]whenever an[CR] action is about to take place; this seems related to using the[CR]SNES9x Next (AKA SNES9x 201) core[CR] with RetroArch and can be fixed be[CR]switching to standard SNES9x[CR] More so here than in the original game,[CR]renaming your characters (especially those with short[CR] names like Cyan,[CR]Gau, and Mog) can result in weird formatting in dialogue boxes; the ones[CR]that[CR] appear during battle cutscenes are notable offenders since they dont[CR]wrap normally and can[CR] potentially result in text overrunning the dialogue[CR]window[CR] Inherent statuses (i.e. regen from the Life Bell) will not[CR]initialize properly on characters who[CR] are dead at the beginning of the[CR]battle, and they will be immune to that status for the duration[CR] of it;[CR]further, the transitions during the Ifrit/Shiva and Chadarnook battles will[CR]trigger this[CR] bug for any character who is dead when they occur (or fix it[CR]if they are brought back to life)[CR] When Gau (or Gogo) rages an enemy with a[CR]single-target move that affects friendlies (Soldier,[CR] Conjurer, Repo Man,[CR]Flan, Witch) during a side attack, he will never target his allies on the[CR]opposite side; this is due to the "one side only" targeting flag that such[CR]spells all have set[CR] Physical Rage attacks that set sleep (Raven and Eye[CR]Goo) will reportedly always miss on enemies[CR] with large sprites; this one[CR]is particularly difficult to nail down due to its transient nature[CR] and[CR]tendency to randomly fix iteself in the process of troubleshooting it[CR] Gau[CR]occasionally likes to slowly creep forward across the battlefield until hes[CR]all up in your[CR] enemies shit; Im fairly certain this is a carry-over from[CR]vanilla thats being exacerbated by[CR] something weve done, but I havent the[CR]foggiest idea what and I dont care enough to find out[CR] A variant of the[CR]above bug can be seen by summoning Phoenix against enemies with large[CR]sprites;[CR] again, this is a vanilla bug and large enemy sprites seem to be a[CR]common denominator with them[CR] Another hold-over from vanilla: foes will[CR]retain the imp sprite if cured by anything other than[CR] the titular spell;[CR]only three enemies (Griffin/Osprey and Tumbleweed) are capable of doing[CR]this[CR] As was (again) the case in vanilla, floating, vanished targets will[CR]still be stripped of their[CR] "clear" status if a ground-based non-physical[CR]attack (i.e. Quake) misses them[CR] When the Quartrstaff multi-targets its[CR]spell proc on an MP-fueled autocrit, it will target *all*[CR] enemies -[CR]including ones who are already dead - due to the way that the targeting is[CR]hard-coded[CR] Treasure chests containing key items (such as the ones at Ebots[CR]Rock) will close if you go into[CR] the menu screen and will be empty if you[CR]attempt to re-open them; this is another vanilla bug[CR] If the first battle[CR]with Ultros ends while Edgar in the air (Jump is available much earlier in[CR]Brave New World than in vanilla), the following cutscene will play out without[CR]him[CR] There have been occasional reports of the rich mans house at South[CR]Figaro experiencing slightly[CR] high load times during Lockes scenario; we[CR]have absolutely no fucking clue why[CR] This little gem:[CR]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BaY8C_4TJM[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]6. VERSION[CR]HISTORY[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Version 1.9.0 (January 06, 2018)[CR] Added new hacks which allow stamina to[CR]influence counter-attacks and the possibility of "true knight"[CR] characters[CR]taking hits for healthy allies (critically-wounded characters are still always[CR]protected)[CR] Fixed a bug where stamina would not protect against status[CR]ailments set by enemy "special" attacks[CR] Added a hack to condense the in-[CR]battle spell menu (removes all empty spaces)[CR] Fucked around with the spells[CR]that each character learns again (highlights: Relm gets Life and Stop,[CR] Mog[CR]picks up Haste, Celes learns Demi much earlier now, and Warp is again pushed[CR]back to the WoR)[CR] The Life spell now revives to 250~500 HP instead of 1/4[CR]maxHP; Phoenix Downs now revive to 1 HP[CR] Raised Cyans base stamina; lowered[CR]the power of the Dragon and Eclipse bushidos to compensate[CR] Raised the[CR]chances for the Dragon bushido to set Stone from 50% to 66%[CR] Raised the[CR]power of the Aurabolt blitz and swapped the levels at which it and Mantra are[CR]learned[CR] Edited the GP Toss formula to do 50% more damage (note: edited[CR]Katanasouls stats to compensate)[CR] Lowered the power of the Blackjack and[CR]Solitaire slot spins[CR] Lowered the cost of several spells, including Demi,[CR]Rasp, Dispel, and SleepX[CR] Lowered the hitrate of several magical attacks to[CR]help make magic evasion more useful[CR] Reworked and rebalanced swords to[CR]offer more (and better) choices for vigor-built characters[CR] Swords that[CR]consume MP for critical hits now respect the "1/2 MP costs" effect of the[CR]Gem/Soul Box[CR] Spears now inherently possess the "may guard allies" property[CR]instead of random counter-attacks[CR] Adjusted the properties of the Wind[CR]Slash and Aero procs from the Kazekiri and Mutsunokami[CR] Removed the[CR]Kagenuis speed boost and slightly adjusted the boosts on Shadows other[CR]weapons[CR] Changed Setzers dice to boost stamina instead of magic and vise-[CR]versa for his other weapons[CR] The Morning Star and Kusarigama now ignore[CR]defense instead of being anti-undead[CR] The Demonsbane is now anti-undead in[CR]addition to holy-elemental[CR] Raised the proc rate of anti-undead weapons[CR]from 25% to 50%[CR] Fixed a bug where using items on undead characters would[CR]randomly kill them[CR] Renamed the Diva Brush to Dali Brush and the Magic[CR]Brush to Monet Brush[CR] Changed the animation of several weapons; also[CR]swapped the animations of the two "Blizzard" attacks[CR] Corrected the[CR]Stormfang menu description[CR] The BatPwr of the Soul Sabre and Omega Weapon[CR]now display correctly in the item menu[CR] The Soul Sabre/Blood Sword are no[CR]longer ignored by the "Optimize" routine; the Omega Weapon now is[CR] Switched[CR]the Colosseum opponents/prizes for the Masamune and Kagenui (and a few[CR]others)[CR] Celes now starts with an Iron Cutlass instead of a Mythril[CR]Bolo[CR] Gogo can now use Throw even if Shadow is dead[CR] Interceptor now[CR]sets Sap[CR] Lowered Golems defense from 192 to 128[CR] Made several changes[CR]to the Battle of Narshe[CR] Made an important update to Atma Weapons[CR]script[CR] Fixed a bug in the Soul Fire script (Wrexsoul fight)[CR]Enabled/disabled random encounters on a few maps for better consistency[CR]Aquilas no longer have any MP as they do not use any attacks that use it[CR]Phunbaba and Doom Gaze now give 10 spell points when defeated as other bosses[CR]do[CR] Fixed a bug where it was not possible to run from all of the enemies in[CR]the New Mines[CR] Rewrote Gaus tutorial to match how Leap now functions; also[CR]added a new line of dialogue for Gau[CR] Added more screenshots, boxart with[CR]cart label, and enemy graphics to the unlockme image[CR]gallery[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Older Versions[CR] Release notes for older versions are located at:[CR]http://btb2.free.fr/mods/ff6/Version.txt[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]7.

Youre sort of like the Dave[CR]Murray of NG+ if[CR] Dave Murray was constantly giving his bandmates horrible[CR]ideas that they wish theyd never had.[CR] I just want you to know that you are[CR]solely responsible for every line in Clean New World thats[CR] actually[CR]dirtier than the ones they replace.[CR] Advent[CR] ------[CR] I cant even[CR]begin to count the number of players that were turned on to Brave New World[CR]between[CR] you and Stann pimping it out to anyone looking for a fun mod to[CR]play. You help keep my forum...[CR] how should I say this... entertaining, and[CR]Im really glad knowing that I always have someone to[CR] talk to if I need it.[CR]Thanks a lot, man. Seriously.[CR] Anima Zero[CR] ----------[CR] It says a lot[CR]that whenever Im looking for a quick opinion, youre one of the first people[CR]that[CR] I always think to ask. Your perspective as a challenge gamer that has[CR]somehow managed to retain[CR] your precious, precious sanity means a lot to[CR]me. Youve taught me that real men take down Randy[CR] "Macho Man" Savage at[CR]level 3 and that Wrexsoul is a little bitch who needs to die before he can[CR]even move. Youve taught me that Gogo is horribly broken and probably always[CR]will be (though at[CR] least a little less so than he was before). And most[CR]importantly, youve taught me that platonic[CR] love *can* exist between two[CR]grown men (no, wait, that was Waynes World).[CR] So, just those first two[CR]things, then.[CR] Bishop[CR] ------[CR] Thank you so much for lending your[CR]extensive knowledge of Ye Olde Broken English to our efforts[CR] in making[CR]Cyan actually speak like the developers intended. And beyond that, thank you[CR]just for[CR] being an awesome member of the community and a great friend to[CR]talk to about Buffy or just what[CR] ever happens to be bothering me at the[CR]moment. I hereby dub thee Pope Woolsey IX, because just[CR] "Pope Woolsey the[CR]First" doesnt really seem to command much authority.[CR] Also, we are no[CR]longer accepting bug reports from you. I dont know what you did to your ROM[CR]and[CR] I dont *want* to know.[CR] DN[CR] --[CR] Menu hacking is an absolute[CR]pain in the ass (or so Im told), so its greatly appreciated that[CR] you are[CR]practically pulling menu hacks out of your ass. You and Think have done so[CR]much for our[CR] mod at this point that youre practically unofficial members[CR]of the team. I sincerely hope that[CR] your work for us has in some way helped[CR]or inspired your work for your own mod, and I hope that[CR] you can pull[CR]through the trials life has sent your way and find your true calling one[CR]day.[CR] Funnyman[CR] --------[CR] Dude, I dont even know where to start.[CR]Youve shown a degree of dedication to this mod thats[CR] exceeded only[CR]possibly by my own. I cant tell you how many nights I spent during[CR]development[CR] (and still even now) obsessing over the tiniest details of[CR]game balance and wondering if it all[CR] would ever end up making a[CR]difference, and you more than anyone else have made me feel like my[CR]efforts were not in vain. I really wish that we had more beta testers like[CR]you, because youre[CR] pretty much a game designers dream (or, at least a[CR]*good* game designers dream).[CR] Hart Hunt[CR] ---------[CR] You may not have[CR]played Brave New World as much as much everyone else Im mentioning has[CR](except[CR] for Arch, I suppose), but youve given me just as much moral[CR]support - if not far more. Youre[CR] like the Ma-Ti of ID if Ma-Ti was totally[CR]metal and not a huge pussy. Seriously, youre one of[CR] the kindest people Ive[CR]ever met. Dont ever change \m/[CR] Lockirby[CR] --------[CR] You crazy,[CR]masochistic bastard. You were the first one to take a mod I thought was[CR]unbreakable[CR] and break it like a fucking Bethesda game. And since[CR]apparently even that wasnt enough for you,[CR] you did it all over again while[CR]blindfolded. If Ive learned at all anything from you, its that[CR] no matter[CR]how hard I try to keep people from breaking my mod, people will just keep[CR]trying to do[CR] it anyway. And honestly, watching them succeed is half the[CR]fun (the other half is the inevitable[CR] fan art of Celes committing suicide[CR]by smashing herself over the head with a morning star).[CR] Mishrak[CR]-------[CR] First and foremost, thanks for the Excel lessons. Its not often[CR]that I pick up skills with my[CR] hobby that are actually useful outside of[CR]it. Beyond that, thanks for that awesome character[CR] planner you made (and[CR]accepting my humble input with it), for one of the funniest moments Ive[CR]ever seen on a non-GDQ stream, and for all the exposure Brave New World ended[CR]up getting as a[CR] result. Lastly, thanks just for being a great friend to us[CR]and a member of the community that[CR] were always glad to have around; your[CR]attitude gives us all something to aspire to.[CR] Nakar[CR] -----[CR] Ive read[CR]your build guide more times than I care to admit (also, I stole a lot of what[CR]I wrote[CR] in the character descriptions from it. Thanks for that &gt;.&gt;) Youve[CR]helped me understand so much[CR] about my own mod and continue to provide me[CR]and the rest of the community with a great wealth of[CR] information that I[CR]know Brave New World is much better off for having.[CR] Nowea[CR] -----[CR]More and more these days, youve come in my eyes to represent the average[CR]player in a community[CR] full of insane challenge gamers and masochists.[CR]Youre always willing to offer a humble opinion,[CR] and Im thankful for all of[CR]the problems weve been able to address as a direct result of having[CR] seen[CR]you suffer through them. Youre kind of like the Job of our community,[CR]really.[CR] Secondadvent (AKA "Revenge of the Advent")[CR]------------------------------------------[CR] You just love finding broken[CR]shit in our mod, dont you? I wouldve been perfectly happy never[CR] knowing[CR]that Quicksand worked on bosses since nobody except you would ever think to[CR]dance the[CR] Desert Aria against a fucking tonberry. Also, I think youre the[CR]only person to have actually[CR] legitimately found the WoB Refract backdoor,[CR]which only furthers my belief that you are a[CR] sorcerer and I thus now fear[CR]you. Please dont turn me into a toad :([CR] Stann[CR] -----[CR] Youre one of[CR]the first people I met at Insane Difficulty, and definitely one of the those[CR]who[CR] convinced me that it was a place worth sticking around. Your help with[CR]testing pretty much every[CR] major release thus far has been greatly[CR]appreciated, and your perspective as a smart player who[CR] actually knows[CR]what hes doing, yet just wants to have some fun while playing a game has[CR]been[CR] invaluable in helping us to fine-tune this thing and make it the very[CR]best that it can be.[CR] Think[CR] -----[CR] You went *way* above the call of[CR]duty on this, dude. At this point, you have easily contributed[CR] more work[CR]to this project than anyone who isnt named BTB or Synchysi. I cant think of[CR]anything[CR] else to say except thank you and Ive got a fence that I think[CR]youll have a blast[CR]painting.[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]...looking for the guys responsible for this mess?[CR] btb@abusemynipples.biz[CR](BTB)[CR] synchysi@yahoo.com (Synchysi)[CR] Please feel free to contact us[CR]with your questions, feedback, comments, concerns, observations,[CR]complaints, insults, ridicule, screeds, japes, thrusts, death threats, and[CR]marriage proposals.[CR] Or better yet, visit any of our discussion[CR]forums...[CR] http://www.ngplus.net/index.php?/forums/forum/3-mods/[CR]http://www.ff6hacking.com/forums/showthread.php?tid=3298[CR]http://www.insanedifficulty.com/board/index.php?app=forums[CR] ...or join us[CR]on Discord: https://discord.gg/eHVZ9xW[CR] Is liking things on Facebook your[CR]bag, baby?

    <plot>What started out with my initial desire to properly case everyone's names[CR]turned into a rather innocent discussion between a co-worker of mine and I[CR]about ways to improve/fix the original game, which in turn (somehow) became[CR]this. FF6 - Brave New World is a fairly complete overhaul of Final Fantasy VI,[CR]featuring... * Character-based esper restrictions and new stat boosts that[CR]promote greater diversity and allow for customized development. * Esper[CR]leveling system that disassociates esper bonuses from traditional levels. *[CR]New and reworked formulas which rescue everything that isn't magic or magic[CR]evasion from the dump-stat heap. * Rebalanced equipment, items, spells, and[CR]skills that aim to remove dead weight and give players more (and better)[CR]choices. * A complete overhaul of enemies from their stats to their behavior[CR]to better challenge veteran players and newcomers alike. * Tons of bugfixes,[CR]as well as remedies to many of the game's more annoying aspects (such as rage[CR]hunting taking a lifetime). * A new script that restores much of what was lost[CR]in translation and builds on existing plotlines and characterization. * And[CR]much, much more, detailed in the Readme (particularly section 4). One thing[CR]BNW is not is a difficulty mod. While it is harder than vanilla FF6, we wanted[CR]to keep it accessible to newcomers while at the same time giving veterans a[CR]new experience. Hopefully, we succeeded. Curious about what other people are[CR]saying about BNW? Like the mod and want to let us know? Hate it and want to[CR]tell us how much we suck? Completely indifferent and just bored? Feel free to[CR]drop by what's become the official forum for discussing BNW: [CR]Read[CR]Me:[CR] Final Fantasy VI: Brave New World - README[CR] TABLE OF[CR]CONTENTS:[CR] 1. A PERSONAL MESSAGE FROM BTB[CR] 2. INSTALLATION[CR] 3.[CR]CHARACTERS and GAME BALANCE[CR] 4. PATCHES and ASSEMBLY HACKS[CR] 5. BUGS and[CR]KNOWN ISSUES[CR] 6. VERSION HISTORY[CR] 7. CREDITS and[CR]CLOSING[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]1. A PERSONAL MESSAGE FROM[CR]BTB[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]One[CR]day, about a year and a half ago, a coworker of mine showed me a Final Fantasy[CR]VI ROM editor hed[CR]found on the world-wide pornography receptacle known as[CR]the internet. We got to talking about how the[CR]editor could be used to fix[CR]bugs and other issues in the game, like how some asshole left the caps[CR]lock[CR]on when he was naming everybody. This soon led to a discussion about[CR]how cool it would be if there was a[CR]way to restrict certain espers to[CR]certain characters, beyond which the story differs depending on which[CR]one[CR]of us you ask since neither one of us wants to assume credit for instigating[CR]this mess. What we can[CR]agree on, however, is that the resulting product is[CR]something that were very proud of.[CR]This mod was created in two basic parts.[CR]Using the above-mentioned editor, I set out to work on the[CR]games character[CR]and enemy data, espers, spells, items, and equipment. A summary of these[CR]changes is[CR]provided in the form of a "printme" file, which is meant to[CR]provide helpful supplemental information to[CR]players - a good deal of which[CR]couldnt be easily provided in-game - as well as invoke nostalgia for[CR]the[CR]days when video games didnt suck and the inclusion of such "feelies"[CR]was standard practice for quality[CR]products. A detailed discussion of these[CR]edits can be found in section three of this readme.[CR]The other half of this[CR]mod is basically everything that I couldnt do in the editor, which was[CR]instead[CR]done by Synchysi in a combination of assembly, hex, and[CR]voodoo/witchcraft. These edits include a large[CR]variety of things, many of[CR]which were not at liberty to share (at least not up-front). Those that[CR]DO[CR]need to be advertised, however, are very important to note and are[CR]detailed in section four.[CR]The third half of this mod (math isnt my strong[CR]suit) is the dialogue/script, which was a joint effort[CR]between the two of[CR]us. The goal wasnt so much to change anything as it was to enhance what was[CR]already[CR]there. We aimed to preserve the areas of the original Ted Woolsey[CR]translation that actually worked while[CR]making what didnt more faithful to[CR]the original Japanese. In addition to this, weve further built[CR]upon[CR]existing characterization and storylines in a manner that will[CR]hopefully blend in seamlessly with the[CR]original and avoid an "obvious fan[CR]translation" feel (at least in the parts that were taken seriously).[CR]Were[CR]very interested in hearing what everyone has to say about the mod, so you can[CR]find our contact[CR]information at the bottom of this readme. Feel free to[CR]write to us with any questions or comments, or[CR]even if youre just feeling[CR]lonely (especially if you also happen to be an attractive Swedish[CR]redhead).[CR]And above all else... have fun. If everyone who tries this mod[CR]out has even half as much fun playing it[CR]as Synchysi and I did making it,[CR]then I would consider it a *huge* success.[CR]Oh, and one last thing:[CR] TALK[CR]TO EVERYONE AT THE BEGINNERS SCHOOL AT NARSHE.[CR] -BTB, May[CR]2013[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]2.[CR]INSTALLATION[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Brave[CR]New World is distributed as an .ips patch, which is the standard for SNES mods[CR]as it avoids the[CR]legal issues of distributing a fully-patched ROM. To make[CR]things as easy as possible for everyone, weve[CR]also included a utility[CR]called "Lunar IPS" which will apply the patch to the ROM directly rather[CR]than[CR]having to set it up through your emulator.[CR]To install the patch,[CR]just follow these easy instructions:[CR] ALWAYS PATCH A CLEAN ROM - that is, a[CR]Final Fantasy 3 US (version 1.0 or 1.1, it doesnt matter)[CR] ROM with nothing[CR]else already patched in. This also applies to when you are updating to a[CR]newer[CR] version of the mod. If you dont patch a clean ROM, youre gonna have[CR]a bad time.[CR] There are two versions of the patch: one for headered ROMS (H)[CR]and one for unheadered ROMS (N).[CR] Applying the wrong patch will result in[CR]the game crashing like a Russian spacecraft on re-entry[CR] when you attempt[CR]to run it, so youll know real quick if you fucked up. An easy way to tell[CR]if[CR] your ROM has a header is to check its size: headered ROMS are 3073 kb,[CR]unheadered are 3072 kb.[CR] If you desire, apply the "Clean New World" patch[CR]AFTER applying Brave New World. Be warned that[CR] Clean New World was not[CR]taken seriously and contains obviously (and badly) censored dialogue.[CR] The[CR]most immediate indication youll receive that the patch took is the new default[CR]window style[CR] when the game loads (the patch doesnt change the title screen[CR]- awesome as it would be - to its[CR] official logo). You can also view what[CR]version of the patch youre playing in the config menu.[CR] Dont freak out when[CR]you see that Terra doesnt have her special Magitek commands anymore - this[CR]is an intentional change to clear up much-needed space in the spell[CR]index[CR]Finally, note that while applying an updated version of the patch to[CR]your game will not invalidate your[CR]existing save states, you should save[CR]the game the normal way (that is, by using an in-game save rather[CR]than a[CR]save state) prior to updating and then reset the game afterward. This is to[CR]clear data out of the[CR]SRAM, which often includes shit that we fix in our[CR]updates.[CR]Oh, and one last thing:[CR] TALK TO EVERYONE AT THE BEGINNERS[CR]SCHOOL AT NARSHE.[CR] (Seriously. Im not kidding. Do[CR]it.)[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]3. CHARACTERS and GAME[CR]BALANCE[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]The[CR]original Final Fantasy VI was a lot of things, but challenging wasnt one of[CR]them. The unfortunate[CR]trend of characters being more or less entirely[CR]interchangeable in combat situations noticeably began[CR]with this game and[CR]only got much, much worse as the series continued. A commendable effort to[CR]create an[CR]unprecedentedly complex system of spells and attacks was matched[CR]with oversight ill-equipped to handle[CR]the plethora of bugs and balance[CR]issues inherent in such a setup without obsessive attention to[CR]detail,[CR]resulting in quite possibly one of the most buggy and broken[CR]mainstream games in existence. Luckily, I[CR]just so happen to be both[CR]exceptionally obsessive and have way too much spare time on my hands.[CR]The[CR]discussion of a subject as broad as overall game balance should probably start[CR]at the same place we[CR]did in development, which is at the characters[CR]themselves. At the very heart of the games diversity is,[CR]as mentioned[CR]above, who you can choose to play as. Final Fantasy VI had a rather unique[CR]system in that[CR]pretty much the entirety of character development was tied[CR]to espers, which carried a few rather obvious[CR]downsides. The first is that,[CR]due to poorly-coded/implemented game mechanics, only one stat (magic)[CR]was[CR]at all worth raising in the first place. This led to a great deal of[CR]munchkining despite nothing at all[CR]resembling enough difficulty to warrant[CR]it, especially considering that, because any character can use[CR]any esper,[CR]the endgame invariably devolved into an Ultima spam-fest (which would be the[CR]other downside).[CR]Two major sets of changes were made to the code by[CR]Synchysi (see section four of the readme) in order to[CR]help me deal with[CR]this issue. First, we had to change the way that the game handles every other[CR]stat so[CR]that magic isnt the only one with any significance whatsoever.[CR]Secondly, we had to take care of that[CR]pesky "everybody can equip every[CR]esper" problem. And so, with both learnable spells and boostable stats[CR]now[CR]restrictable by character, I set out to mold each one of them into a unique[CR]flower.[CR]Heres a quick (not really)[CR]rundown:[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]TERRA and CELES[CR] -------------[CR]Terra and Celes are discussed together[CR]because they both still function very similarly to one another.[CR]Theyre[CR]essentially red mages on steroids: Jills-of-all-trades who can easily adapt to[CR]any team you put[CR]them in and who can excel in any role that theyre set up[CR]for. Both lack a directly offensive special[CR]skill, and so their usefulness[CR]is largely dependent on their spells and equipment. Lucky for them,[CR]they[CR]have access to most of the games best equipment along with more espers[CR](and thus more spells) than the[CR]rest of the cast. Terras main advantages[CR]are a superior spell selection and a skill that capitalizes on[CR]her beat-[CR]stick nature, while Celes is more well-rounded with better stats and spells[CR]that tend to focus[CR]more on strategy than raw power.[CR]Runic and Morph have[CR]both been through some significant mechanical changes, as well. The former has[CR]been[CR]standardized to work on all white, grey, and black magic (any spell[CR]that starts with a colored dot), but[CR]not on any "blue" magic (any attack[CR]that doesnt). This, along with the fact that many more enemies use[CR]such[CR]spells in general, is meant to make using the skill both more intuitive to use[CR]and worth your while[CR]to do so. A few assembly hacks (discussed in section[CR]four) also fix some bugs it had so that it feels a[CR]lot more like a proper[CR]ability instead of a broken mess.[CR]Regarding Morph, its now a toggled stance[CR]rather than a timed one and the first of several skills that[CR]aims to rescue[CR]stamina from the "dump stat" heap by allowing it to reduce the doubled damage[CR]that Terra[CR]now takes in her esper form in return for the offensive boost[CR]that it provides. This makes using Morph[CR]a decision that hinges on more[CR]than just a simple matter of Terra being "charged up" for it, and those[CR]who[CR]are willing to suffer the drawbacks will find that a morphed Terra is easily[CR]Brave New Worlds most[CR]fearsome warrior and will likely be the first (and[CR]possibly only) character to hit the damage[CR]cap.[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]LOCKE[CR] -----[CR]At first glance, Locke appears to be nothing more than an[CR]inferior version of Terra and Celes. He lacks[CR]their raw magical power and[CR]their massive spell repertoires, instead focusing mainly on physical[CR]attacks[CR]and healing magic. But what he lacks in their versatility he picks[CR]back up with high speed and evasion.[CR]Neither stat featured very prominently[CR]in the original game, and Locke serves as a good example of just[CR]how[CR]significant these advantages are now. He tends toward armor of the lighter[CR]variety and dual-wielding[CR]is now baked in to his weapon of choice rather[CR]than enabled by a relic, so his main defense is just not[CR]getting hit in the[CR]first place. Furthermore, his speed advantage will be felt both in his role as[CR]healer[CR]as well as his ability to dish out physical damage much faster than[CR]most other characters can.[CR]Lockes magical abilities are also aided by the[CR]fact that he is now one of the three characters to which[CR]the X-Magic[CR]ability is restricted. However, dual-casting with Locke is something of a[CR]double-edged sword[CR]and an effective demonstration of how the more limited[CR]MP pools for the games non-primary spellcasters[CR]relegates them to more[CR]physical roles. That said, Locke is more than capable of outperforming the[CR]girls[CR]on both the offensive and restorative magical fronts, but it requires[CR]a focus on building and managing[CR]his MP in order to pull off.[CR]Rounding[CR]out Lockes skillset is Steal, which was reworked to make a bit of fucking[CR]sense. Only enemies[CR]who might be actually holding something (i.e. humans)[CR]can be stolen from on Brave New World - trying to[CR]steal from a bear will[CR]just get you a very dead Locke. The idea is that fewer and more obvious[CR]targets[CR]for theft along with better rewards for doing so will make treasure[CR]hunting more attractive. The formula[CR]has been reworked to use Lockes speed[CR]for both the odds of success (which previously compared his level[CR]to his[CR]victims) and the odds of getting a "rare" steal (previously a static 1/8[CR]chance), and successful[CR]theft now immediately refills Lockes ATB meter so[CR]that attempts can be chained together. This not only[CR]makes it easier to[CR]quickly rob entire enemy parties, but also upgrades "Mug" to a tactical multi-[CR]strike.[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]EDGAR[CR] -----[CR]In stark contrast to the above, Edgar is a character whose[CR]usefulness is tied almost completely to his[CR]special skills. Although one of[CR]our overall goals was to make regular physical attacks more[CR]appealing,[CR]Edgar remains the games one character with a clearly preferable[CR]alternative is his Chainsaw and/or his[CR]Drill. In the original game, Edgar[CR]peaked early due to his tools being very overpowered initially, but[CR]they[CR]failed to scale well and left him with little else to do in the endgame[CR]besides dragooning. Weve[CR]thus overhauled his tools and their effects in not[CR]only an attempt to keep the skill relevant into the[CR]late game, but also to[CR]reduce the gross amount of redundancy that many of them possessed (Chainsaw[CR]vs.[CR]Drill comes immediately to mind). Of specific note are his two new[CR]tools - the Defibrillator and Mana[CR]Battery - which provide a significant[CR]degree of support utility and allow for an alternate Edgar build[CR]that seeks[CR]to capitalize on something other than just hitting things.[CR]Of course,[CR]making Edgar a physical powerhouse is still very much an option, and his[CR]weapons have been[CR]reworked to ensure that they remain an important part of[CR]his load-out even if they are only functioning[CR]as stat sticks. Swords[CR]provide good basic stat boosts, whereas spears have been retooled into[CR]defensive[CR]weapons that boost max HP and randomly protect allies. Spears now[CR]also possess the "hold with both hands[CR]for moar damage" property (the[CR]"Gauntlet" effect), which can combine with the inherent bonus that[CR]spears[CR]already add to jump attacks for some truly amazing damage. In part[CR]because of this, and in part because[CR]of the whole "unique flower" thing,[CR]dragooning is now exclusive to Edgar and Mog (well, and Gogo).[CR]One[CR]advantage of particular note in going the dragoon route is that jumping[CR]is not subject to the back-row[CR]"half damage" damage penalty, whereas the[CR]Drill and Chainsaw (see section four below) now are.[CR]Ultimately, Edgars[CR]most notable feature in pretty much any build is likely his ability to tank.[CR]He gets[CR]a lot of HP through both his equipment and espers and he likes his[CR]heavy armor. He also gets more than[CR]one long-range physical attack (that[CR]Autocrossbow may end up more useful in the late game than you may[CR]think),[CR]so camping in the back row is always an option for The King. He gets several[CR]healing and support[CR]spells to assist him in this role, but he must rely[CR]exclusively on his other skills for damage[CR]output.[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]SABIN[CR] -----[CR]Sabin has been through quite a number changes in Brave New[CR]World in order to make him fit his character[CR]archetype. Whereas his brother[CR]is basically Kain from FF4 with Tools and a permanent hard-on, Sabin[CR]now[CR]more closely resembles Yang. The mere presence of Blitz originally[CR]relegated his regular attacks to the[CR]rubbish bin, and his claws didnt even[CR]make for decent stat sticks since the best blitzes all did magic[CR]damage[CR](due to the games original physical damage formula being total garbage).[CR]Taking a cue from Yang,[CR]the new name of Sabins game is lots of elemental[CR]damage and lots of status effects: his claws now all[CR]deal elemental damage[CR]and have random spellcasts attached. Hes then forced to dual-wield them in[CR]true[CR]Monk style by no longer being able to equip shields. He makes up for[CR]this, as well as his inability to[CR]wear much in the way of armor, by[CR]possessing some of the games best natural stats, again because[CR]monk.[CR]Blitzes have also been reworked, just as Tools were, in attempt to[CR]keep them all useful throughout the[CR]game. The result is a varied skillset[CR]that provides a choice as to how to develop Sabins stats. A vigor[CR]Sabin,[CR]for example, will focus more on physical blitzes like Pummel and Suplex, both[CR]of which continue[CR]his "status" theme by setting sap and slow, respectively.[CR]Both statuses are of little consequence in the[CR]original game since theyre[CR]the mildest of the lot, but they rise to prominence in Brave New World[CR]where[CR]they are now universally effective - particularly on (most)[CR]bosses.[CR]On the other hand, several blitzes are now affected by Sabins[CR]stamina, making him one of the best users[CR]of this once-useless stat. A[CR]stamina-based Sabin is a more defensive Sabin who assists his allies[CR]with[CR]Mantra and its new counterpart (Chakra) that restores his teams MP[CR]instead of their HP. This Sabin will[CR]rely more on the now stamina-based[CR]Aurabolt blitz for damage, especially since the physical ones[CR](which[CR]Aurabolt is *not*) are now subject to the back-row penalty just as[CR]Edgars Drill and Chainsaw are.[CR]Early in the game, Sabins natural stats will[CR]make him one of the most powerful and beefiest characters[CR]available. Later[CR]on, his limited armor options will become more of an issue and hell have to[CR]rely more[CR]on his high HP to stay on his feet. One advantage of particular[CR]note that Sabin has in this regard is[CR]that his high vigor and stamina will[CR]help him take much more consistent damage from enemy attacks due to[CR]how[CR]they now function as a sort of "natural" defense (see section four below for[CR]details), but he still[CR]ends up eating more of it in the long run than most[CR]everyone else[CR]does.[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]CYAN[CR] ----[CR]Cyan suffered immensely in the original game for being the[CR]most physically-oriented fighter in a world[CR]where magical damage reigned[CR]supreme and shitty balance decisions made 7/8 of his special attacks[CR]not[CR]worth the fucking lifetime it took to use them. He gets a much-needed[CR]overhaul in Brave New World in the[CR]form of a both a new global physical[CR]damage formula that renders his style of combat no longer complete[CR]shit, as[CR]well as some special attention to his special skills in the same vein as Tools[CR]and Blitz before[CR]them. From the undead-vanquishing powers of Mindblow (the[CR]"Dies at 0 MP" flag is now used exclusively on[CR]undead foes) to the supreme[CR]physical damage of Tempest (AKA "Quadra Slice"), every bushido has a[CR]purpose[CR]to fill and a chance to shine. Also, the Bushido meter no longer[CR]takes a fucking lifetime to charge.[CR]Like Sabin, Cyan is now denied the use[CR]of shields in order to force the inherent "can be held with both[CR]hands for[CR]extra damage" bonus on all of his weapons, which helps make even his regular[CR]physical blows a[CR]mighty force to be reckoned with. Also like Sabin, Bushido[CR]techniques that do physical damage will only[CR]be half as strong to those[CR]without a brave warrior spirit who cower in the back row. But even with[CR]these[CR]drawbacks, Cyans heavy armor and earlier access to Empowerer ensures[CR]that hes just as good at taking[CR]damage as he is at dishing it out.[CR]Furthermore, the overall lack of diversity in his esper bonuses more[CR]or[CR]less guarantees that hell end up with more vigor and/or HP than just about[CR]anyone else.[CR]Build-wise, Cyan really only has two options. You either pump[CR]his vigor to solidify him as the resident[CR]king of physical damage or go[CR]balls-deep into HP and stamina to make him a rock that spams stamina-[CR]based[CR]bushidos from the back row. Like Edgar, he has some healing spells so[CR]that he can bring his allies back[CR]from the brink whenever he finds himself[CR]the last man standing, and the fact that Empowerer also absorbs[CR]MP also[CR]makes Cyan one the mods best out-of-battle patch-up guys.[CR]In conclusion,[CR]Cyan is a pretty straightforward guy who mostly hits stuff and tosses out the[CR]occasional[CR]heal regardless of how hes set up, but at least now he does what[CR]he does exceptionally[CR]well.[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]SHADOW[CR] ------[CR]Being a ninja, Shadow naturally winds up in the role of[CR]"fragile speedster" in this mod. He doesnt use[CR]shields because ninjas have[CR]no interest in defending themselves when they can instead be dual-[CR]wielding[CR](or two-handing, in the case of katanas) totally sweet ninja[CR]weapons, and the armor that he does wear is[CR]of the "dont get hit in the[CR]first place" variety. Shadow thus tends to die whenever he gets hit,[CR]but[CR]unless hes up against an attack that cant miss he almost never does. He[CR]nearly ends up with the same[CR]problem as Edgar where a superior - and row-[CR]ignoring - special skill renders his normal physical attacks[CR]pointless and[CR]thus relegates him to permanent "back-row" status, but the high price of[CR]throwables along[CR]with the semi-exclusive option for X-Fight later in the[CR]game are sufficient to lure him out.[CR]Regarding Throw, its now restricted[CR]exclusively to knives, scrolls, and stars (no more chucking swords[CR]or[CR]rods), and each type of throwable now functions more uniquely than before.[CR]Knives tend to do the most[CR]damage, but are more expensive and only single[CR]target, whereas throwing stars can now be "spread" like a[CR]spell to hit a[CR]group of enemies. Scrolls, as always, do elemental damage that can be[CR]extremely powerful[CR]against a single target since the damage is forcibly[CR]"split" against multiple targets. Finally, Shadow[CR]can now set the image[CR]status (also known as "blink") on his teammates rather than just on himself[CR]with[CR]Smoke Bombs (known in the original game as "Shadow Edges"), which[CR]along with his handful of healing and[CR]support spells make him an excellent[CR]utility character to have on hand.[CR]Shadows greatest asset by far, however,[CR]is his unmatched speed. Pound for pound, Shadow has the highest[CR]DPS[CR]potential of any character in the game due (mostly) to just how fast he can[CR]attack; this is why hes[CR]balanced by being made of tissue paper. Add to this[CR]his above-mentioned support capabilities and you get[CR]an incredible addition[CR]to any team - provided you can figure out how to keep him[CR]alive.[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]GAU[CR] ---[CR]Gau has always been a love-him-or-hate-him sort of guy, and at[CR]least that much hasnt changed here. What[CR]Ive tried to do is make it harder[CR]to hate loving him by overhauling his Rage list in the same spirit as[CR]the[CR]other special skills, thus rendering the 64 remaining rages (down from nearly[CR]four times that amount[CR]in the original) at least as desirable as the five[CR]or six of them that were at all useful before, not to[CR]mention a great deal[CR]more diverse. The mechanics of leaping and The Veldt itself have also been[CR]fixed so[CR]that those inclined to use him no longer need to invest a lifetime[CR]into building him up. Without going[CR]into too much detail, enemies without[CR]rages (not to be confused with Men Without Hats) no longer appear[CR]on The[CR]Veldt, and you dont actually have to be on The Veldt to learn their[CR]rages.[CR]Stat-wise, Gau ends up drinking from the same punchbowl as Shadow:[CR]he dies in a gentle breeze, he likes[CR]to evade damage instead of taking it,[CR]and hes one speedy little shit. Much like Shadow - perhaps even[CR]more so -[CR]Gau ends up retardedly fast by the end of the game largely due to a lack of[CR]other useful stats[CR]to boost through his espers. Combined with the fact that[CR]his primary (ok, only) means of attack requires[CR]no user input beyond the[CR]initial selection, Gau can easily be Brave New Worlds fastest character.[CR]In[CR]the end, though, Gau is still the same as hes always been: useful bordering on[CR]broken if used well,[CR]but very difficult to use well. As the majority of his[CR]effectiveness stems directly from proper/clever[CR]use of his rages, the info[CR]found in the printme should prove especially helpful to Gau fans.[CR]Otherwise,[CR]hes designed so that even if you only grab a handful of rages,[CR]those few are at least still[CR]useful.[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]SETZER[CR] ------[CR]Setzer, perhaps most importantly, is one of the games[CR]major healers. Hes also arguably the tankiest,[CR]with the potential to gain[CR]lots of HP and being mostly restricted to heavy armor. While his selection[CR]of[CR]healing spells is obviously important to this role, equally notable are[CR]his Slots. Losing spins are now[CR]twice as powerful as they were in the[CR]original game and act as sort of a poor mans version of Banons[CR]Health[CR]command, thus making for a quite effective - and spammable - full-party[CR]heal.[CR]How Setzer likes to heal will depend in part on where his stats are.[CR]Traditional cure magic scales with[CR]magic power, as do his Slots. The Remedy[CR]and Regen spells, however, which now restore HP in addition to[CR]their normal[CR]effects, instead scale in power with stamina. Both are of much more use in[CR]Brave New World[CR]due to a larger focus on status effects, particularly sap[CR]and regen. Additionally, Setzer is one of only[CR]three casters of an upgraded[CR]Regen spell (the other two being Terra and Relm) which targets the[CR]entire[CR]party and is one of the main selling points of a build that focuses[CR]on stamina over magic.[CR]On the offensive side of things, Slots have been de-[CR]rigged to favor skill completely instead of RNG, and[CR]winning spins allow a[CR]magically-built Setzer to contribute significantly to the teams damage output[CR]if[CR]hes good enough at nailing them. Physically, he has the option to dual-[CR]wield and is now the exclusive[CR]user of the new "X-Fight" relic; he also has[CR]access to weapons that either arent subject to the damage[CR]penalties imposed[CR]by either of those things (Dice) or rely on random procs rather than direct[CR]damage to[CR]be effective (Doom Darts). The fact that Setzer cant raise his[CR]vigor through espers also means that his[CR]physical damage output is[CR]completely unaffected by his build choice. And then theres GP Toss, which[CR]has[CR]been reworked into a stamina-based attack thats most likely a stamina-[CR]focused Setzers best option for[CR]consistent, reliable damage that doesnt[CR]involve giving up his shield.[CR]Ultimately, however, Setzer is more about[CR]tanking than he is about fighting. His ability to take hits[CR]ranks up there[CR]with the likes of Edgar and stamina Cyan, but hes not usually as good at[CR]returning fire[CR]as they are since his attack options tend to require either[CR]luck or sacrifice to be truly viable. Its[CR]through that first catch that[CR]Setzers "gambler" persona carries over to his role in combat, and[CR]most[CR]battles will tend to see him as either a top contributor or a creepy[CR]paperweight.[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]MOG[CR] ---[CR]Mog is something of an oddball character in Brave New World. He[CR]gets a generous selection of esper stat[CR]boosts and a great potential to[CR]maximize them since hes an entirely optional character, but what you[CR]focus[CR]on will depend largely on what you want to do with him. He doesnt really[CR]hybridize well, which[CR]leads to some very unusual and rather extreme build[CR]options.[CR]Probably the most obvious choice is to focus on Mogs magic power,[CR]which boosts both the potency of his[CR]spells and of his offensive dance[CR]steps. With a smattering of offensive and status magic to choose[CR]from,[CR]access to the X-Magic ability, and the ability to equip rods, going[CR]whole hog into jacking up his magic[CR]power is far from a bad idea. Note,[CR]however, that Dance also uses his stamina not only to determine the[CR]odds of[CR]stumbling on non-native terrain, but also to raise the effectiveness of the[CR]steps that heal the[CR]party. The eight dances themselves have been rebalanced[CR]to be more uniquely tailored to specific builds[CR]and situations rather than[CR]just being the same thing eight times over, just with different[CR]backgrounds.[CR]Water Rondo, for example, is a heavily offensive dance that[CR]will be mostly appreciated by a magic-built[CR]Mog looking to deal big damage,[CR]whereas Forest Suite is a more defensive dance that can be utilized[CR]to[CR]great effect by a tankier build. Both examples are particularly useful[CR]in boss battles, whereas other[CR]dances like Love Sonata and Dusk Requiem are[CR]more suited to random crowd control.[CR]On the flip-side, Mog can also opt to[CR]forgo all of that "magic" crap and embrace his role as the mods[CR]other[CR]potential dragoon. While he may at first appear to be pretty much just Edgar,[CR]but cuter, he gains[CR]access to a few things that drastically set him apart[CR]from everyones favorite perv, the least of which[CR]is a weapon type other[CR]than spears that make for viable pogo sticks. Generally speaking, Mog most[CR]likely[CR]wont be doing much attacking aside from jumping since his physical[CR]damage output is otherwise lacking.[CR]Ideally, whenever a physically-built[CR]Mog isnt taking a hint from Van Halen, hell instead be taking[CR]advantage of[CR]his spells and dances that dont rely on his raw magic power to be[CR]effective.[CR]The conclusion is that, while Mog has many skills and abilities[CR]available to him, no one build is really[CR]able to take full advantage of[CR]them all. Instead, its better to focus on what you want out of him and[CR]work[CR]toward that goal. Failing that, he tends to be a sub-par character with little[CR]purpose other than[CR]being the adorable team/corporate mascot and a rather[CR]blatant author[CR]avatar.[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]STRAGO[CR] ------[CR]Strago is essentially Cyans magical counterpart in Brave[CR]New World: he casts the spells that makes the[CR]peoples fall down. He boasts[CR]the highest natural (and potential) raw magic power in the game, as well[CR]as[CR]an ability which makes great use of it. Lore, as you can probably guess[CR]by now, has been given the same[CR]treatment as every other skill before it[CR](Rage being perhaps the best direct comparison) wherein all of[CR]the useless[CR]crap has been dutifully pruned out and all that remains is now more useful.[CR]His normal spell[CR]selection is a bit less impressive, but he gets X-Magic to[CR]keep it competitive/interesting. As for his[CR]equipment, all rods (Stragos[CR]weapon of choice) now possess the "consumes MP for critical hits"[CR]property[CR]so that their random spellcasts can help Strago deal big magical[CR]damage even with his regular attacks.[CR]All of this makes him more dependent[CR]on MP than any other character to be at all effective in battle,[CR]however,[CR]and so hes one of the few characters able to significantly boost it through[CR]both espers and[CR]equipment and one of only two to which the Osmose spell is[CR]now restricted.[CR]Stragos two main disadvantages are that hes squishy and hes[CR]slow as all fuck. His natural stats and[CR]armor will provide him with good[CR]magical defense, but his physical defense and HP will remain quite low.[CR]His[CR]shitty speed can be overcome with enough of the right equipment, though it[CR]will likely come at the[CR]expense of maximizing his other stats (by which I[CR]mean his magic power). How hes built and loaded out[CR]will hinge mostly on[CR]whether you prefer to use him primarily as a nuker or to take advantage of the[CR]many[CR]utility spells and lores that he possesses to support the rest of the[CR]team. In either case, he probably[CR]needs to stay in the back row since the[CR]only advantage of not doing so is better random cast damage from[CR]his rods -[CR]and I can really only think of three or four or five situations where thats[CR]worth dying[CR]for.[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]RELM[CR] ----[CR]Relm may seem like a pint-sized, foul-mouthed version of her[CR]grandfather at first, but shes actually a[CR]very different beast. Both are[CR]glass cannons with an emphasis on powerful magic, but their[CR]similarities[CR]end there. First off, she trades a bit of her grandfathers raw[CR]magic power to get back some much-needed[CR]speed. Second, Relm possesses a[CR]handful of the games strongest spells both as her main advantage and as[CR]her[CR]main weakness. Dubbed "Little Miss Overkill" in testing, Relm functions well[CR]as both an offensive[CR]powerhouse and as a traditional healer. The downside[CR]is that shes something of a two-trick pony and has[CR]little else going on for[CR]her otherwise. Her early-game offense is largely limited to Sketch - which[CR]has[CR]at least been fixed to no longer destroy the universe when she uses it,[CR]as well as to actually deal some[CR]fucking damage once in awhile. And her[CR]primary healing ability outside of end-game magic is whacking her[CR]friends[CR]with a paint brush, which (for some reason) now heals them. Definitely a late[CR]bloomer, this one.[CR]Because of Relms strong emphasis - that is to say her[CR]outright dependence - on powerful magics, shes[CR]the (only) other character[CR]who now learns Osmose so that she at the very least remains self-[CR]sufficient.[CR]Just remember that shes still quite squishy, so stick her in[CR]the rear and use her speed and offensive[CR]magic as a means to eliminate as[CR]much of the enemy threat as quickly as[CR]possible.[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]UMARO AND GOGO[CR] --------------[CR]These two, lastly, end up in Brave New[CR]World as largely enhanced versions of what I presume they were[CR]originally[CR]meant to be. Umaro is big, strong, and hits like a fucking truck. Due to this,[CR]hell appeal[CR]greatly to inexperienced players that are just looking for a[CR]tank to smash shit up. But because he cant[CR]really do anything *else*, his[CR]long-term usefulness is somewhat limited.[CR]Gogo, on the other hand, looks[CR]downright horrid on paper due to his shit stats and generally[CR]lackluster[CR]equipment options. However, the mysterious pile of rags holds[CR]great rewards for the clever player who[CR]takes the time to unlock his true[CR]potential. In the original game, Gogos role was heavily diminished by[CR]the[CR]aforementioned fact that, by the time you found him, your team was already[CR]full of faceless Ultima[CR]factories. But if weve at all succeeded in our goal[CR]to mold every character into a unique being, each[CR]with their own distinct[CR]advantages and disadvantages, then there is tremendous value in someone who[CR]can[CR]wield any of those advantages at will. In fact, if not for his abysmal[CR]stats, Gogo would be hands-down[CR]the absolute best character in the game.[CR]And even with them... he still very well may[CR]be.[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Finally,[CR]theres the obstacles that your team will face: the enemies themselves.[CR]Something that I firmly[CR]believe to be a common failing of many mods is an[CR]either overwhelming or outright complete focus on the[CR]challenge, whereas[CR]the design philosophy driving Brave New World is that challenge is merely a[CR]means to[CR]an end and that the focus of (almost) any good game should instead[CR]be on the characters that you control[CR]to overcome them. Make no mistake:[CR]this mod is is more difficult than the original game, and not just by[CR]sheer[CR]virtue of fixing its many broken mechanics. However, Brave New World was[CR]neither made nor marketed[CR]as a "difficulty" hack - a label far better[CR]suited to mods that place their difficulty in the spotlight.[CR]Back to the[CR]point, the changes made to enemies in this mod are worthy of note because they[CR]represent a[CR]significantly large portion of the total work done. Everything[CR]about enemies, from their stats to their[CR]formations to their AI, has been[CR]gutted and rebuilt from the ground up. The primary goals are a[CR]greater[CR]variety of enemy behavior and an increased focus on good strategy[CR](as in, not just mashing A to win) in[CR]order to defeat them. Once again,[CR]many other mods tend to fall into the trap of interpreting "strategy"[CR]as[CR]"do this one specific thing to win", or worse "exploit this one broken[CR]mechanic to win". And not to[CR]beat a dead horse here, but our mod isnt about[CR]that. Brave New World is about choice - to make the game[CR]your own and find[CR]your own route to victory, wherever that route may take you.[CR]As you can[CR]see, any discussion about the enemies in this mod will quickly turn into[CR]discussion about its[CR]attitude toward difficulty in general. To say more[CR]about them than I already have would spoil the fun of[CR]figuring them out for[CR]yourself. Pay attention, use all of the tools at your disposal (that includes[CR]the[CR]ol brain meats), and most importantly...[CR] TALK TO EVERYONE AT THE[CR]BEGINNERS SCHOOL AT NARSHE.[CR] (Or Ill eat your fucking[CR]children.)[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]4. PATCHES and ASSEMBLY[CR]HACKS[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Esper Restrictions This is pretty much the cornerstone of the entire mod; it[CR]restricts the[CR] ------------------ use of espers only to characters who are[CR]compatible with them (see the[CR] printme for a full list), thus allowing us[CR]to make the characters more[CR] unique due to the fact that espers are pretty[CR]much the only contributing[CR] factor to character development in Final[CR]Fantasy VI.[CR] Esper Bonuses Aside from the above (and complimentary to it),[CR]the most sweeping change[CR] made in Brave New World is transforming the esper[CR]level-up stat bonuses[CR] from an apparent last-minute afterthought in the[CR]games design into the[CR] core of character development and customization.[CR]Espers now offer the following (per-level) stat bonuses:[CR] HP +60[CR] MP[CR]+40[CR] HP +30/MP +15[CR] HP +30/Stamina +1[CR] MP +25/Stamina +1[CR] Vigor[CR]+1/HP +20[CR] Magic +1/MP +15[CR] Vigor +1/Speed +1[CR] Magic +1/Speed +1[CR]Vigor +1/Stamina +1[CR] Magic +1/Stamina +1[CR] Speed +1/Stamina +1[CR] Vigor[CR]+2[CR] Magic +2[CR] Stamina +2[CR] Speed +2[CR] Esper Experience We[CR]encountered several obstacles regarding esper stat boosts, the least[CR] of[CR]which was that almost every stat sucked (see "nATB System", "Physical[CR]Damage", and "Stamina Overhaul" below) and the most persistent of which[CR]was that FF6s leveling system was clearly not designed with esper stat[CR]boosts in mind. This ultimately resulted in an environment where, after[CR]everything else was all said and done, players were penalized for not[CR]keeping levels as low as possible in the early game because every level[CR]gained without espers was "empty". Late-game characters like Setzer and[CR]Strago were hit particularly hard by this, as was any character build[CR]which relied heavily on World of Ruin espers (i.e. magic/support Locke).[CR]To balance this, stat boosts from espers were given their own leveling[CR]system independent of regular levels. Each character starts out at an[CR]"esper level" (EL) of 0 - regardless of their regular level - and gains[CR] EP[CR](exp. for esper levels) according to the following formula:[CR] EP = (spell[CR]points * exp.) / 8[CR] (NOTE: Spell points were renamed from "magic[CR]points")[CR] Note that esper levels use the same experience table as regular[CR]levels[CR] and cap at 25. Also note that a character will not gain any EP if[CR](s)he[CR] has no esper equipped, which is no longer an issue because...[CR]Esper Bank The newfound advent of character builds eventually found itself at[CR]odds[CR] with the fact that they still had to equip espers to learn spells,[CR]which[CR] meant a lot of battles on the Veldt and/or micromanagement of[CR]experience[CR] gains to avoid gaining unwanted esper levels. To alleviate this[CR]concern[CR] and finally put the whole matter to bed once and for all, spell[CR]points[CR] earned by characters in battle now go into a "bank" for each[CR]character,[CR] and spells are now learned by spending them in the esper menu[CR]without[CR] needing to actually equip that esper and fight with it on. The[CR]learning[CR] rate for spells on espers is now the cost of that spell; the[CR]maximum[CR] amount of spell points that any character can bank at a time is[CR]30.[CR] Similarly, esper levels are "banked" in the same manner as spell[CR]points[CR] are rather than being granted immediately upon earning them in[CR]battle.[CR] This completely eliminates the need to micro-manage equipped[CR]espers for[CR] the purposes of stat gains, and it also allows for a "re-spec"[CR]feature[CR] later in the game that reverts all of your spent ELs to the bank[CR]so that[CR] you can rebuild characters with different stat boosts. To spend a[CR]banked[CR] EL, just click on the EL bonus in the esper menu. Pretty simple,[CR]right?[CR] Esper Junctions The only problem with how the EL bank system[CR]removed the need to micro-[CR] manage espers was exactly that - players no[CR]longer had a reason to care[CR] who had what equipped since the only[CR]functional difference between them[CR] all at that point was summoning them in[CR]battle. To address this, espers[CR] now have an "on equip" bonus just like a[CR]piece of equipment - such as a[CR] stat boost or reducing incoming elemental[CR]damage - that is completely[CR] separate from that espers EL bonus.[CR] For[CR]example, Kirin offers a +5 bonus to Magic when equipped, but raises[CR] HP and[CR]Stamina for each EL spent. The former is a static bonus that is[CR] only[CR]present so long as Kirin remains equipped, whereas EL bonuses are[CR]permanent, cumulative, and not contingent on the esper being equipped.[CR]Characters may also mix and match EL bonuses from their available espers[CR]to their liking, whereas only one may be equipped at any given[CR]time.[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Levels and Experience Character levels are now capped at 50 with a "soft" cap[CR]starting in the[CR] ------------------- late 30s (expected end-game levels are[CR]mid-30s). Growth is otherwise[CR] linear except for three "humps" after levels[CR]10, 20 and 30. For more[CR] details, consult the experience/level chart in the[CR]printme.[CR] Level Averaging In the original game, characters were brought up[CR]to the teams average[CR] level at set points throughout the game. This was a[CR]feature we initially[CR] removed entirely due to issues discussed above with[CR]esper stats, as well[CR] as to encourage using a variety of characters rather[CR]than just the same[CR] four characters while everyone else sits on the bench.[CR]The EL system has[CR] since removed the first problem, and so weve reinstated[CR]level averaging[CR] in a manner that only addresses the second.[CR] To the[CR]point, level averaging now occurs at only one point in the game[CR] aside from[CR]initial averaging thats done for each character when they[CR] join (or, in[CR]Shadows case, *every* time he joins you in the World of[CR] Balance). Everyone[CR]gets re-averaged at the games halfway mark, which is[CR] importantly distinct[CR]from how the game originally did it for everyone[CR] when you re-obtained them[CR]later on; with the averaging all done at once,[CR] theres no longer any[CR]benefit in putting off getting anyone back.[CR] (Also note that, for obvious[CR]reasons, esper levels cannot be gained via[CR] re-averaging - that much must[CR]still be done the old-fashioned way.)[CR] Concerning the initial levels that[CR]characters join up at, that has also[CR] been changed. In the original game,[CR]most characters joined at slightly[CR] above the party average, whereas now[CR]everyone except Gogo (average -3)[CR] and Umaro (average +5) now joins at the[CR]exact[CR]average.[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]nATB System The short explanation of what this hack does is that it pauses the[CR]ATB[CR] ----------- timer during attack animations, while the "Fight" command[CR]is targeting,[CR] and while Bushido is charging. This has two effects: one, it[CR]makes speed[CR] contribute more significantly to how fast and often a[CR]character acts in[CR] battle, as well as preventing it from effectively soft-[CR]capping at around[CR] 60 or so; two, it removes the exploit of camping in the[CR]item menu under[CR] the "wait" setting to gain a huge speed advantage. The[CR]resulting system[CR] is basically a modified version of "wait", which I[CR]mention because there[CR] is no longer an "active/wait" setting, nor a "battle[CR]speed" slider.[CR] Speed Tweak Removing the soft cap from speed and thus[CR]allowing faster characters to[CR] get more turns over time turned it into[CR]something of a DPS god stat, if[CR] not just a god stat in general. In[CR]response to this, the overall effect[CR] of speed was lowered at high levels[CR]while slightly raising the effective[CR] speed of slower characters. Refer to[CR]the below benchmarks, comparing the[CR] number of turns gotten by several[CR]characters over the same timeframe.[CR] CHARACTER TURNS (OLD) TURNS (NEW)[CR]--------------- ----------- -----------[CR] Strago (31 SPD) 4.0 4.0[CR] Terra[CR](48 SPD) 5.33 5.0[CR] Celes (71 SPD) 7.0 6.0[CR] Shadow (126 SPD) 10.66[CR]8.4[CR] First Strike On the flip-side of the above, a major intended feature[CR]of speed was to[CR] allow faster characters to act first in battle. The[CR]original formula to[CR] determine characters initial ATB fill in battle took[CR]speed very little[CR] into account and was instead largely randomized. Speed[CR]is now factored[CR] more heavily, with faster characters like Locke and Shadow[CR]now getting[CR] first strike in battles much more often than not.[CR] Initital[CR]ATB fill% =[CR] OLD: ([Spd...(2Spd - 1)] + ([0...9] * 8) + 16G) * 256 /[CR]65535[CR] NEW: ([2Spd...(3Spd + 29)] + ([0...9] * 4) + G) * 256 / 65535[CR] G[CR]= (10 - Number of entities in battle)[CR] Command Delays Complementary to the[CR]above changes, we have edited the delays between[CR] command input and[CR]execution to balance various skills:[CR] NO DELAY ($00) SHORT DELAY ($10)[CR]-------------------- --------------------[CR] Steal/Mug Fight[CR] Runic[CR]Item[CR] Leap Rage[CR] Mimic Dance[CR] Revert Throw[CR] Defend/Row Sketch[CR]Possess Health[CR] Magitek ???[CR] MODERATE DELAY ($20) LONG DELAY ($40)[CR]-------------------- --------------------[CR] Magic/X-Magic* Morph[CR] Tools[CR]Summon (esper)[CR] Blitz[CR] Bushido HUGE-ASS DELAY ($70)[CR] Slots/GP Toss[CR]--------------------[CR] Lore Jump (air time)[CR] *X-Magics delay is[CR]effectively $40 in practice[CR] And thats... really all you need to know.[CR]Below, Ill go into the finer[CR] details of battle timing and what nATB had to[CR]change to work within the[CR] game, but Id recommend just skipping ahead to[CR]the physical damage hack.[CR]-------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Combat Speed First of all, the nATB system triples the speed of the combat[CR]timer to[CR] make up for the fact that it pauses it incessantly. This is[CR]meaningless[CR] to the layperson as the combat timer concerns only enemy A.I.,[CR]but what[CR] is relevant are the speed "multipliers" for the haste and slow[CR]statuses[CR] (plus a third for "normal" speed). Because even small speed[CR]differences[CR] are much more impacting in nATB - and also because Slow is now[CR]effective[CR] against anything (even bosses) without inherent haste - it was[CR]necessary[CR] to narrow the gap between the three statuses to keep them in[CR]check:[CR] NEW MULTIPLIERS OLD MULTIPLIERS[CR] ---------------[CR]---------------[CR] Slow 60x Slow 32x[CR] Normal 75x Normal 64x[CR] Haste 90x[CR]Haste 84x[CR] Note that while the end result is a net increase to the flow of[CR]combat,[CR] the pacing will feel slower very early in the game when your have[CR]fewer[CR] characters (especially given that Terra is one of the slower[CR]characters[CR] in the mod) and you dont yet have any speed-boosting espers or[CR]gear.[CR] Status Timers Several status effects utilize a timer to determine[CR]when they wear off;[CR] since these are different timers than the global timer[CR]mentioned above,[CR] it was again necessary to shorten their durations to[CR]compensate for the[CR] fact that their incrementation is constantly being[CR]interrupted:[CR] NEW TIMER SETTINGS OLD TIMER SETTINGS[CR] ------------------[CR]------------------[CR] Stop 5 Stop 18[CR] Sleep 10 Sleep 18[CR] Freeze 10[CR]Freeze 34[CR] Reflect 15 Reflect 26[CR] Condemned * Condemned *[CR] Note that[CR]cutting the timers for sleep and reflect in half renders their[CR] durations[CR]about the same as they were originally, while stop and freeze[CR] were further[CR]reduced as a balance measure. Condemned is a bit tricky,[CR] since its timer[CR]is generated by the following formula:[CR] Random Number = [Casters[CR]Lv...((Casters Lv * 2) - 1)][CR] Timer starts @ (79 - Random Number) / 2[CR](NOTE: minimum starting timer value is 10)[CR] This formula is largely[CR]identical to the one from the original game; all[CR] thats been changed is[CR]that both the end result and the minimum starting[CR] time have been cut in[CR]half to compensate for nATB.[CR] Timer Speed The speed at which the timers[CR]count down in the original game is roughly[CR] 1 tick every 1-2 seconds; the[CR]nATB system cuts that speed about in half[CR] due to the constant[CR]interruptions. The X-factor in play here is that the[CR] speed of these timers[CR]is also affected by slow and haste - theyll count[CR] down slower if youre[CR]slowed and faster if youre hasted. For the most[CR] part this makes sense,[CR]since the beneficial status will cause negative[CR] ones to wear off more[CR]quickly and the detrimental one makes them linger.[CR] However, the frequency[CR]of regen/sap/poison ticks (which are also edited[CR] by nATB, but unimportant[CR]to this discussion) are also affected by timer[CR] speed, which means that a[CR]hasted character will also take more frequent[CR] damage from sap and poison[CR]while a slowed character takes less. It also[CR] means that the condemned[CR]status kills you quicker if youre hasted and[CR] slower if youve been slowed.[CR]Reflect is sort of a wash since it can be[CR] seen as either positive or[CR]detrimental depending on your situation, but[CR] the fact that its duration is[CR]tied to your speed is still kind of weird.[CR] !Viva La Retreat! The last[CR]thing that nATB edits is the run timer, since running away from[CR] fights[CR]would be virtually impossible it it didnt. I wont get into the[CR] specifics[CR]since theyre largely irrelevant, but the short answer is that[CR] running away[CR]is somewhat harder than before under ordinary circumstances[CR] and a lot[CR]harder from non-overworld battles in second half of the game.[CR] Its[CR]generally advised to warp (via Warp Whistles or the titular spell)[CR] from[CR]late-game encounters if you wish to avoid[CR]them.[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Physical Damage The formula for physical (non-magical) damage dealt by[CR]characters has[CR] --------------- been completely rewritten so that vigor[CR]plays a more significant role.[CR] OLD PHYSICAL DAMAGE FORMULA[CR]---------------------------[CR] Dmg = BatPwr + (Lv^2 * (2Vgr + BatPwr) / 256)[CR]* 3/2[CR] NEW PHYSICAL DAMAGE FORMULA[CR] ---------------------------[CR] Dmg[CR]= 2Vgr + BatPwr + ((Lv^2 * Vgr / 16) * (BatPwr / 16)) / 24[CR] Vigor = Defense[CR]In addition to determining physical damage dealt, vigor now helps reduce[CR]incoming physical damage, as well. See "Random Variance" in the stamina[CR]overhaul section below for more details.[CR] Back Row Nerfs The back row now[CR]only reduces incoming physical damage by 25%. Outgoing[CR] physical damage is[CR]not only still halved, but the penalty now extends to[CR] physical damage[CR]dealt by the Tools(*), Blitz, and Bushido commands[CR] (*Exception: the[CR]Autocrossbow, which is long range)[CR] For the record, the only two commands[CR]that inherently deal row-ignoring[CR] physical damage regardless of weapon are[CR]Jump and Throw. Physical damage[CR] from other commands, i.e. Mug and Sketch,[CR]does not ignore row. The fixed[CR] damage from GP Toss also ignores row, but[CR]is not considered physical.[CR] Blind Accuracy Further to the above, the blind[CR]status (renamed from "dark") now affects[CR] all physical and most(*) stamina-[CR]based damage from special commands (all[CR] of which remain otherwise 100%[CR]accurate). The exception is (hilariously[CR] enough) Sketch, which is[CR]technically classified as a magical attack.[CR] (*Exception: Cyans Eclipse[CR]bushido, as noted in the printme)[CR] In addition, hitting something in the[CR]back (side/pincer attacks) is now[CR] affected by blindness, as well, whereas[CR]before a back attack would never[CR] miss under any circumstances. It also[CR]isnt circumvented by weapons that[CR] never miss or by relics that grant[CR]perfect[CR]accuracy.[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Stamina Overhaul In the original game, stamina did as close to nothing as a[CR]stat could[CR] ---------------- possibly do without actually doing nothing[CR](like evasion did). Its main[CR] purpose was to act as a separate layer of[CR]evasion against attacks which[CR] considered it, except only instant death[CR]attacks did. That role has now[CR] expanded to include fractional damage (i.e.[CR]Demi), redirectional damage[CR] ("steals HP"), MP damage, and all status[CR]ailments. To further emphasize[CR] the role of stamina in defending you[CR]against such attacks, its now the[CR] *only* evasion check against them. In[CR]the printme, this is indicated by[CR] listing their hitrates as "Stam%", so[CR]thats what that is.[CR] The stamina evasion formula is a simple (Stamina/128)[CR]chance of success,[CR] and a rewrite of its functionality allows it to only[CR]consider the status[CR] portion of attacks that also deal regular damage. Such[CR]attacks will use[CR] regular (or magical) evasion to determine hit probability[CR](assuming that[CR] its an attack that can be dodged), and then will run a[CR]stamina check if[CR] the attack hits to determine if the status is set. In the[CR]printme, such[CR] attacks use the verbiage "may set (status)" instead of "sets[CR](status)".[CR] This edit also affects negative statuses set by enemy "special"[CR]attacks:[CR] regular physical attacks with either an added status effect or a[CR]damage[CR] multiplier (most notably used by Gau in most of his rages).[CR](NOTE: any attack with "Stam%" accuracy will always set its status when[CR] it[CR]hits, since its hitrate IS the stamina check)[CR] It should be noted that[CR]enemies also possess stamina; Brave New World[CR] lowers the minimum and[CR]maximum values for enemy stamina from 17~40 to[CR] 1~32 (the formula is simply[CR][MaxHP/256] with a cap at 32). This is done[CR] so that weak enemies remain[CR]vulnerable to status attacks while casting[CR] Slow on a boss still has a[CR]relatively decent chance (75%) to hit.[CR] To keep things simple for the[CR]player, all attacks which are used only by[CR] your party skip the stamina[CR]check for statuses if the attack also deals[CR] damage. This is done to remove[CR]unnecessary guesswork since enemies dont[CR] give any visual indication of[CR]many statuses, such as slow or blind. I do[CR] make an exception with the[CR]"Chocobo/Chocobo/Chocobo" winning Slots spin,[CR] since stop is a bit too OP[CR]to allow players to set en masse with perfect[CR] accuracy. The other outliers[CR]are Drain and Osmose, which foes dont use[CR] so that I could give them set[CR]hitrates instead of stam% ones; the Bserk[CR] and Imp spells, which cant miss[CR]since they can be used beneficially on[CR] your own party; and the Poison[CR]spell (but *not* Bio), so that its the[CR] better spell to use if youre just[CR]looking to set the status.[CR] Random Variance In addition to helping you[CR]avoid most of the nastier side effects of[CR] magical attacks, stamina now[CR]also acts as an additional layer of defense[CR] against their primary effects[CR]in the same manner that vigor now reduces[CR] physical damage. This is done[CR]via the games "random variance" formula,[CR] which is applied to every attack[CR]that doesnt do a set amount of damage.[CR] OLD RANDOM VARIANCE FORMULA:[CR]----------------------------[CR] Damage = (Damage * [224...255] / 256) + 1[CR]NEW RANDOM VARIANCE FORMULA:[CR] ----------------------------[CR] Damage =[CR](Damage * [Low...High] / 225) + 1[CR] Low = 225 - (Vigor or Stamina * 2/3)[CR]High = 255 - (Vigor or Stamina)[CR] In the original game, random variance was[CR]a fixed range between 87% and[CR] 99% of the original value; in Brave New[CR]World, high vigor and/or stamina[CR] will help you take less - and more[CR]consistent - damage from attacks. To[CR] better demonstrate the effects of[CR]this, here are some examples:[CR] 24 Vigor/Stamina = 92% ~ 102%[CR] 30[CR]Vigor/Stamina = 91% ~ 100%[CR] 36 Vigor/Stamina = 89% ~ 97%[CR] 42[CR]Vigor/Stamina = 87% ~ 94%[CR] ---[CR] 60 Vigor/Stamina = 82% ~ 86%[CR] 90[CR]Vigor/Stamina = 73%*[CR] 120 Vigor/Stamina = 64%*[CR] (*A negligible amount of[CR]variance still applies)[CR] The four benchmarks on the top represent the[CR]initial values that (most)[CR] characters possess for vigor and stamina, while[CR]the three on the bottom[CR] show the effects of raising them via equipment[CR]and/or espers. Note that[CR] the range of damage at 60 vigor/stamina is[CR]significantly smaller than at[CR] the earlier benchmarks, and the variance[CR]disappears (*almost) completely[CR] at 90 when the ceiling hits the floor.[CR]Vigor and stamina see diminishing[CR] returns beyond that point as the ceiling[CR]continues to drop at the same[CR] rate as the floor, though it should be worth[CR]mentioning that very few[CR] characters will realistically ever reach that[CR]point.[CR] (Also, in case you were wondering, curative spells and abilities[CR]still[CR] use the old random variance formula.)[CR] Stamina Attacks Less[CR]broadly, stamina is now a factor in several spells/attacks/commands[CR](replacing the role of magic power wherever applicable), making it more[CR]individually appealing to the characters that use them. This includes...[CR]...the Remedy and Regen spells (which now also cure HP)[CR] ...Harvester and[CR]Sun Bath (Rage/Dance moves)[CR] ...Rock, Tentacle, and Shrapnel (Rage[CR]attacks)[CR] ...several blitzes (refer to the printme for details)[CR] ...two[CR]bushidos (ditto)[CR] ...Dance (non-native dance success % = (96 + Stam * 2) /[CR]255)[CR] ...Morph (see "Morphology" description below)[CR] ...GP Toss (see[CR]"Make It Rain" description below)[CR] ...Umaros "Blizzard" attack (see "Umaro[CR]Hit Hard" below)[CR] ...the Atma/Omega Weapon (see "Atma and Omega"[CR]description below)[CR] ...desperation attacks (previously magic-based)[CR]...Interceptor (ditto)[CR] ...??? ((Lv^2 * Stam) / 12) + (Users Current HP *[CR]2)[CR] Just to be clear, all of the above except for the Atma/Omega Weapon[CR]are[CR] considered to be magical rather than physical and are thus unaffected[CR]by[CR] 25% physical damage boosts from relics/espers or the back-row[CR]penalty.[CR] (And just to be clearer, ALL DAMAGE IS MAGICAL UNLESS OTHERWISE[CR]STATED.)[CR] Tank and Spank Counter to the above, which sells stamina as an[CR]alternative attack stat[CR] with some defensive capabilities, we wanted a way[CR]of meshing it with the[CR] other stats in a meaningful way. It was thus[CR]decided that it should be[CR] tied to two equipment-enabled abilities: cover[CR](synergizes with HP) and[CR] counter-attacks (synergizes with vigor).[CR] As[CR]was the case in vanilla, characters with "true knight" equipment will[CR]always take hits for allies who are at "near fatal" status, even if they[CR]themselves are also at critical HP. Now, in addition to that, guardians[CR]who are not in critical status may also take hits for *healthy* allies.[CR]Cover% (healthy allies) = Stam / 192[CR] To balance this, characters can no[CR]longer cover AT ALL while in the back[CR] row, evasion is halved for any[CR]attack that he or she jumps in front of,[CR] and covering an ally will break a[CR]character out of the "defend" status.[CR] Interceptor will also not protect[CR]Shadow if hes covering someone else.[CR] (See "Smart Cover" below for further[CR]changes to the cover mechanic.)[CR] For the "spank" half of things, the games[CR]original counter-attack rate[CR] was 75%. We found this to be excessive once[CR]we got other things sorted[CR] out (see "Parry and Counter" below), so we[CR]opted for a new formula that[CR] bases the counter-attack rate on stamina[CR](starting at a floor of ~50%).[CR] Counter-Attack% = (Stam + 32) / 128[CR](See also "Parry and Counter" below.)[CR] Sap and Regen Moving on, the[CR]formulas for regen and sap/poison (all of which are much[CR] more prominent[CR]statuses in this mod than they were originally) have been[CR] edited to allow[CR]stamina to contribute more significantly toward raising[CR] the amount of HP[CR]restored by the former while now defending against the[CR] latter (originally,[CR]stamina *raised* the damage dealt by sap/poison).[CR] OLD REGEN/SAP[CR]FORMULA[CR] ---------------------[CR] *Tick = ((MaxHP * Stam) / 1024) *[CR](Random Variance)[CR] (*If sap on a player character, tick is halved)[CR] NEW[CR]REGEN FORMULA[CR] -----------------[CR] Tick = ((MaxHP / 32) + Stam) * (Random[CR]Variance)[CR] (NOTE: Random Variance is 87% ~ 99%)[CR] NEW SAP FORMULA[CR]---------------[CR] Tick = (MaxHP / (16 + (Stam / 8)) * (Random Variance)[CR](NOTE: Random Variance is the new formula shown above)[CR] Note that the first[CR]part of the formula is stored in an 8-bit value, and[CR] is thus capped at[CR]255. The minimum value for random variance is 1, so no[CR] regen or sap tick[CR]can exceed 254 (further, because sap damage to player[CR] characters was[CR]originally halved, it could never exceed 127).[CR] Poison Edits Poison works[CR]in a manner similar to sap, except that it only ticks half[CR] as frequently[CR]and each tick deals incrementally more damage. Originally,[CR] the increment[CR]value was equal to the value of the initial tick; we have[CR] halved the[CR]increment value in Brave New World to keep poison from being[CR] too[CR]detrimental of a status (given the lower overall HP totals of player[CR]characters compared to the original game).[CR] Weve also corrected an error[CR](possibly intentional, but I doubt it) in[CR] the original code wherein the[CR]variable that increments with each tick[CR] doesnt reset when the status is[CR]cleared, so poison ticks will now start[CR] back over at the beginning if the[CR]status is re-applied to the same d00d[CR] in the same battle rather than[CR]picking back up where they left off.[CR] Magic Bonus Fixes As a side effect of[CR]the above changes, weve also fixed two other bugs[CR] wherein the "magical[CR]damage +25%" relic property was raising the damage[CR] of sap/poison ticks -[CR]even allowing them to go over the 8-bit cap - and[CR] wasnt being applied to[CR]curative spells. We also thought it a little bit[CR] odd/overpowered that the[CR]magic damage bonuses were stackable whereas the[CR] physical ones were not, so[CR]they no longer are[CR]now.[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Evade Bug Fix Physical and magical evasion now function properly instead of[CR]magical[CR] ------------- evasion covering both types and physical evasion[CR]doing nothing at all.[CR] Seems like a simple enough fix, right?[CR]However...[CR] Status Evasion Fixing the evasion system awakened a dormant[CR]mechanic from deep within[CR] the games code wherein physical attacks will[CR]gain accuracy bonuses or[CR] penalties (+/-25%) if the target has certain[CR]statuses set. Some of these[CR] made sense and were left alone, like how being[CR]slowed, blinded, muddled,[CR] or zombied will now make the afflicted easier to[CR]hit. Others, most oddly[CR] the rerise (AKA "Life 3") status being subject the[CR]same penalty, were[CR] fucking retarded and were thrown in the trash where[CR]they belong.[CR] The big issue, however, wasnt with the accuracy bonuses, but[CR]rather the[CR] penalties when attacking targets affected by the haste, sap,[CR]poison, and[CR] "near fatal" statuses. Not only did none of these make any[CR]sense (except[CR] for haste, but haste is OP enough already), but their[CR]newfound ubiquity[CR] in Brave New World - haste and sap in particular - made[CR]balancing the[CR] physical game hell (and yes, those penalties *stacked*).[CR](Needless to say, the penalties in the above paragraph are now gone.)[CR]Parry and Counter On the flip side to the above, a functional evasion system[CR]combined with[CR] several characters who are very much built for it (Locke and[CR]Shadow come[CR] immediately to mind) rendered the "randomly counters" property[CR]less than[CR] useful since characters could originally only counter attacks[CR]that had[CR] successfully hit them (which in Shadows case usually left him too[CR]dead[CR] to retaliate). We have removed this requirement, thus allowing the[CR]likes[CR] of Locke and Shadow to parry and counter to their hearts[CR]content.[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Evasion% Since evasion and MBlock (magic evasion) max out at 128 instead of[CR]100,[CR] -------- they are no longer represented in-game as a percentage.[CR]Accuracy% For simplicitys sake, the accuracy of all weapons and physical[CR]attacks[CR] made by the enemy (except ones that never miss) have been set to[CR]100%.[CR] The odds of any regular physical attack connecting are thus a[CR]straight[CR] check against the targets evasion (out of 128) while all other[CR]physical[CR] attacks (i.e. those from special commands like Blitz and Bushido)[CR]never[CR] miss* unless the attacker is blind - this is why the printme only[CR]lists[CR] hitrates for magical attacks.[CR] (*Exception: Edgars Autocrossbow,[CR]which behaves like a normal weapon)[CR] And this is where it gets a little[CR]confusing. Because of the presence of[CR] evasion, 100% is only a perfect[CR]hitrate if the targets evasion is zero;[CR] a "true" perfect hitrate is 255%.[CR]And again to keep things as simple as[CR] possible, enemies in Brave New World[CR]do not possess magical evasion.[CR] tl;dr In other words, any (magical)[CR]hitrate shown in the printme is exactly[CR] that if the target is an enemy,[CR]whereas it will be lower against your[CR] characters since they actually[CR]possess magical evasion. Anything without[CR] a hitrate will never miss unless[CR]its a physical attack and the attacker[CR] is blind or if its just a regular[CR]physical attack (i.e.[CR]Fight/Rage).[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Vanish/Doom Fix One of the original games more infamous bugs (and one of the[CR]select few[CR] --------------- to warrant a shitty patch job in all subsequent[CR]releases) related to the[CR] "clear" status circumventing instant death[CR]attacks. This is *properly*[CR] fixed in Brave New World via an external hack[CR]created by Terii Senshi.[CR] "Special" Fix Lesser known (and infinitely less[CR]exploitable) than the above bug is one[CR] where enemy "special" attacks with[CR]the instant death flag would flat-out[CR] ignore death immunity altogether,[CR]vanish or not. The root cause of both[CR] bugs is the roundabout way that the[CR]code treats death as a status, and[CR] the general lack of enemy specials in[CR]the original game that are set to[CR] do so leads me to believe that the[CR]developers had to have been aware of[CR] this bug on at least some level. In[CR]any case, its fixed now.[CR] Overcast Fix Similar to the above, another patch[CR]fixes an issue with an attack called[CR] Overcast forcibly setting zombie on[CR]your party regardless of immunity.[CR] This led to it being impossible to[CR]remedy due to how immunities work in[CR] this game; Overcast now simply no[CR]longer bypasses zombie[CR]immunity.[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Abort On Enemies Failing the old "Vanish/Doom" trick, a vanilla players[CR]primary fallback[CR] ---------------- for any undead enemies (including[CR]bosses) is simply to toss a Phoenix[CR] Down or Revivify on it and call it a[CR]day. My first response to this was[CR] simply to make items unable to target[CR]enemies, but clever players know[CR] that the muddle status can get around[CR]that little fix. That is, it *did*[CR] work until we hard-coded certain things[CR]to not work on enemies at all.[CR] Thing is, quite a few of the games laundry[CR]list of bugs tend to involve[CR] hitting enemies with shit thats not meant to[CR]be used on them, Palidor[CR] being a rather notable offender. Curiously,[CR]theres a targeting flag in[CR] the games code to abort an attack in the event[CR]that it somehow ends up[CR] targeting the party, yet theres no equivalent for[CR]the *enemy* party,[CR] where such a flag is actually needed.[CR] Long story[CR]short, we made an "abort on enemies" flag for shit thats not[CR] supposed to[CR]be used on enemies. And as for shit that is fine to use on[CR] just *regular*[CR]enemies, but not on bosses...[CR] Boss Immunity The "Suplex" byte, which[CR]originally prevented Suplex from targeting[CR] certain enemies (primarily[CR]those of the floating or stationary variety),[CR] is now a hard override to[CR]prevent fractional damage attacks (i.e. Demi,[CR] Quartr) from being cheesed[CR]against bosses. Such attacks originally were[CR] set to miss anything immune[CR]to instant death, so instant death attacks[CR] were thus always preferable.[CR]Fractional damage now deals earth and/or[CR] wind damage and follow suit with[CR]other earth and wind attacks by being[CR] generally very powerful, but unable[CR]to hit a weakness due to a lack of[CR] them (though some enemies still resist[CR]them).[CR] In addition to fractional damage attacks, this flag is also used by[CR]the[CR] Rerise spell (to prevent issues/bugs with bosses that drop items),[CR]and[CR] the Snare dance step (which otherwise disregards death immunity).[CR]And yes, Suplex works on everything now - have fun pile-driving[CR]Kefka.[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Genji Glove Fix Dual-wielding weapons now results in a 25% decrease in damage[CR]from both[CR] --------------- weapons (as it was originally intended to do).[CR]Note that this patch has[CR] been modified from the original version created[CR]by Assassin17 (as noted[CR] in the credits) to only affect regular physical[CR]attacks instead of all[CR] attacks that deal physical damage (i.e. most of[CR]Sabins blitzes).[CR] Dual Wind Slash Another modification to this hack allows[CR]the damage penalty to affect[CR] Wind Slash and Aero when weapons randomly[CR]cast them in place of regular[CR] physical damage. See also the Gauntlet fix[CR]below for more on this.[CR] Dual-Wield Weapons Finally, note that the dual-[CR]wield property is now attached to certain[CR] weapons (see the printme) rather[CR]than to a relic. Any weapon possessing[CR] the dual-wield property allows a[CR]second weapon to be used regardless of[CR] whether or not the second one[CR]allows for it - a sword and dagger combo,[CR] for example, is a valid setup.[CR]The only exception is spears, which are[CR] disallowed in dual-weapon setups[CR](this only affects Mog) because I spent[CR] most of development running my Mog[CR]with a spear/boomerang load-out and[CR] Synchysi thought it was bloody[CR]stupid.[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Gauntlet (Fix?) Holding certain weapons in both hands now increases battle[CR]power by 50%[CR] --------------- rather than 75%. This was done because, as[CR]with the dual-wield property,[CR] two-handed functionality is now applied to[CR]specific weapons rather than[CR] enabled by a relic and the games original[CR]bonus led us to some balance[CR] issues (think "dragoon"). A modified version[CR]of an external hack known[CR] as "Throw Down (part of) The Gauntlet" is also[CR]utilized to allow their[CR] effective battle power to be shown accurately in[CR]the equip menu.[CR] 2-Hand Wind Slash As also with the above hack, a 50%[CR]damage bonus will also apply to Wind[CR] Slash and Aero when two-handed[CR]weapons randomly spark them in place of[CR] regular damage. Combined, these[CR]two allow for a very noticeable balance[CR] between those weapons when used by[CR]Shadow (who typically dual-welds) and[CR] Cyan (who is forced to use both[CR]hands since he cant use a shield).[CR] Two-Handed Weapons Finally, note that[CR]using two hands for weapons that allow it is entirely[CR] optional (except for[CR]Cyan, who as noted above is forced to do so by his[CR] equipment[CR]restrictions). Specifically, giving Edgar or Mog a spear and a[CR] shield[CR](i.e. The SPARTAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! Setup) is allowable even though it[CR] looks[CR]like the game doesnt want to let you do it. To further illustrate[CR] this, an[CR]empty off-hand will now turn yellow (instead of gray) if a two-[CR] handed[CR]weapon is equipped in the other[CR]one.[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Sketch Fix First and foremost, using Sketch should no longer cause the[CR]universe to[CR] ---------- implode on itself thanks to a patch that fixes[CR]whatever in the hell was[CR] wrong with it in the original game. So, theres[CR]that.[CR] Sketch Formula Second, the Sketch formula now uses Relms (or Gogos)[CR]stats instead of[CR] those of the enemy so that its actually worth using.[CR]Brushless Sketch Finally, Sketch is now disallowed unless a brush is equipped[CR]by a patch[CR] called "Brushless Sketch" (which does pretty much the exact[CR]opposite of[CR] what its name suggests) because painting with a knife is[CR]something that[CR] only psychopaths do (which Relm kind of is, come to think[CR]of it).[CR] Brush Targeting Aside from allowing Sketch, the other feature of[CR]paint brushes in Brave[CR] New World is that they now cure HP rather than[CR]damage it (a la the Heal[CR] Rod). The targeting code has been edited so that[CR]they correctly target[CR] your party by default instead of the enemy, and vice[CR]versa in the event[CR] that Relm (or Gogo) is muddled or[CR]bserked.[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Auto-Swordless Runic Similar to the Brushless Sketch patch (both utilize the[CR]same base code,[CR] -------------------- and so Brushless Sketch requires this[CR]one to work), Auto-Swordless Runic[CR] keeps Celes from spamming the ever-[CR]loving shit out of Runic when shes[CR] muddled or at the Colosseum if she[CR]doesnt have a sword to Runic *with*.[CR] Elemental Runic Weve also corrected a[CR]bug wherein Runicd spells would not be stripped[CR] of their elemental[CR]properties, so protection from any element would also[CR] "protect" Celes (or[CR]Gogo) from absorbing the spells MP[CR]cost.[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Persistent Rage Fix So named because the original name is stupid (its made by[CR]the same guy[CR] ------------------- who made Brushless Sketch and Auto-[CR]Swordless Runic... go figure) and not[CR] really descriptive of what the patch[CR]does. What it does is recalculates[CR] resistances whenever Gau dies so that[CR]elemental immunities/weaknesses he[CR] gains through Rage wont persist (and[CR]stack) throughout the battle.[CR] Rage Status Patch This is an extension of[CR]the above written by Think (nATB, many others),[CR] which fixes it to also[CR]affect statuses. The problem with the original[CR] patch was that the[CR]recalculation code does not remove statuses that you[CR] are immune to because[CR]the code basically interprets status immunity as[CR] "cannot be toggled on or[CR]off". Thus, characters who are given statuses[CR] like safe or haste by their[CR]equipment, or in this case by Rage, are then[CR] considered by the game to be[CR]"immune" to those statuses.[CR] This patch does two things to correct the[CR]above issue. First, it strips[CR] characters of any status that isnt provided[CR]by their equipment whenever[CR] resistances are recalculated (i.e. when they[CR]die). Second, whenever Gau[CR] enters the rage status, he is purged of all[CR]statuses that his rage gives[CR] him immunity to (*actual* immunity, not[CR]"inherent" immunity). Note that[CR] in addition to preventing Gau from being[CR]stuck with status ailments that[CR] he cant cure, this also fixes an exploit[CR]where raging a monster that[CR] absorbs poison damage (all of whom resist the[CR]poison status in Brave New[CR] World) with the poison status set basically[CR]gave you regen on[CR]steroids.[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Leap Anywhere The "Leap" command can now be used on any rageable formation,[CR]regardless[CR] ------------- of whether or not you are on the Veldt. While[CR]this does give Gau earlier[CR] access to some key rages in certain areas, its[CR]largely a QoL patch that[CR] makes it easier to collect all of his rages.[CR]Unlike before, Leap no longer ends the current battle. Rather, it will[CR]remove Gau from the party for its duration (hes counted as dead for the[CR]purpose of what happens if the rest of your party wipes); he will learn[CR]the rages of the enemy party whether or not you win the fight or[CR]run.[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Smart Cover This fixes the "protect allies" effect to behave more[CR]intelligently than[CR] ----------- before. Primarily, it disables blocking[CR]attacks that originate from your[CR] own team under most circumstances, which[CR]has the significant benefit of[CR] preventing party members from being[CR]"protected" from Relm trying to heal[CR] them with a brush.[CR]Muddled/Zombied/Charmed characters will be allowed to[CR] hit themselves, but[CR]not their teammates. One notably important change in[CR] light of the fact[CR]that characters can now cover non-critical allies (see[CR] "Tank and Spank[CR]above) is that cover will no longer activate on a counter-[CR] attack from an[CR]enemy - only proactive strikes.[CR] Cover is also disabled under the the[CR]following other conditions:[CR] If bodyguard has... If target has...[CR] Blind[CR]Image[CR] Bserk Magitek[CR] Image Death (*)[CR] Magitek Stone (*)[CR] Muddle[CR](unchanged) Zombie (*)[CR] Sleep (unchanged) Clear (unchanged)[CR] Death[CR](unchanged)[CR] Stone (unchanged)[CR] Zombie (unchanged)[CR] Clear[CR](unchanged)[CR] *This game was programmed by monkeys, I swear[CR] Finally,[CR]cover is disabled entirely if Golem is active, and attacks that[CR] would be[CR]nullified/absorbed by the intended target are also not[CR]blocked.[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Impology Imp was always one of the more misunderstood statuses in the[CR]original[CR] -------- game, mainly since it wasnt very up-front about what it[CR]did and even it[CR] seemed to not have a very good idea about it was trying to[CR]be. It was a[CR] weird offensive debuff/mute hybrid that didnt even behave the[CR]same way[CR] on enemies as it did on your party. And dont even get me[CR]*started* on[CR] how buggy the animation was/is.[CR] Now, imp is a simple[CR]output debuff: 50% off everything, both offensively[CR] and healing-wise. Its[CR]basically the exact opposite of Morph (see below)[CR] except that it doesnt[CR]affect incoming damage. Attacks and spells with[CR] fixed or fractional damage[CR]are also unaffected, but the imp penalty does[CR] apply to some things that[CR]you wouldnt expect it to like items and regen[CR] and sap/poison ticks (this[CR]is explained a bit more in the next[CR]section).[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Morphology Terras Morph ability is now a toggled stance rather than a timed[CR]one.[CR] ---------- Rather than doubling her offensive output and halving all[CR]magical damage[CR] taken, it now boosts her output by 50% at the expense of[CR]doubling *all*[CR] damage taken. This damage penalty is reduced by 1/128 for[CR]each point of[CR] stamina that Terra has, down to a minimum of 25% at 96[CR]stamina.[CR] Its important to note that the 50% output boost from Morph[CR]applies to[CR] pretty much everything. The Morph bonus is added to damage[CR]calculation[CR] as a "multiplier", which in the original game are ignored by[CR]any attack[CR] that ignores defense. This is no longer true - defense-ignoring[CR]spells[CR] and abilities now respect multipliers*. This includes curative[CR]spells,[CR] which ignore defense as an obvious necessity. Because the games[CR]code is[CR] weird, the Morph multiplier will also be applied to items that[CR]restore a[CR] set amount of HP/MP (i.e. Dried Meat), but not to items like[CR]Tonics or[CR] Ethers that restore fractional amounts - apparently, beef jerky[CR]is 50%[CR] more delicious when a naked pink lady is cramming it down your[CR]gob.[CR] (*Exception: the Flare spell is hard-coded to ignore damage[CR]multipliers)[CR] On the subject of healing, the above-mentioned damage penalty[CR]does not[CR] distinguish between incoming damage and incoming healing -[CR]everything[CR] will hit her for higher numbers (except for fixed or fractional[CR]values).[CR] This means that, although Terra will be more fragile in her esper[CR]state,[CR] shell also be much easier to heal. Where things start to get[CR]confusing[CR] is sap and regen ticks, which receive the damage multiplier from[CR]Morph[CR] because the game considers those things to be Terra hitting herself.[CR]For[CR] that same reason, however, their numbers are also boosted by the[CR]penalty[CR] that doubles all incoming damage. This means that the same stat[CR]which[CR] raises the strength of her regen ticks in the first place will in[CR]fact[CR] *lower* the boost they get from Morph, making the whole mess a[CR]wash.[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Atma and Omega Due to the lower overall levels that everyone will achieve in[CR]this mod,[CR] ------------ the special damage formula used by the Atma (and[CR]now Omega) Weapon ends[CR] up nerfing the ever-loving shit out of it since it[CR]assumes a "baseline"[CR] level of 64(!). To remedy this problem, its formula[CR]has been gutted:[CR] OLD ATMA WEAPON FORMULA[CR] -----------------------[CR]1. Normal attack (ignores defense)[CR] 2. Dmg = Dmg * Lv[CR] 3. Dmg = Dmg *[CR]((HP / 256) + 1) / ((MaxHP / 256) + 1)[CR] 4. Dmg = (Dmg / 64) + 1[CR] NEW[CR]ATMA WEAPON FORMULA[CR] -----------------------[CR] 1. Normal attack (ignores[CR]defense) w/ stamina in place of vigor[CR] 2. Dmg = Dmg * ((HP / 256) + 1) /[CR]((MaxHP / 256) + 1)[CR] Bserk ITD Boost As mentioned in the above hack[CR]description, all defense-ignoring attacks[CR] now respect damage multipliers.[CR]Aside from Morph, the only other effect[CR] that change has is that defense-[CR]ignoring weapons are now boosted by the[CR] bserk status, where previously[CR]they were not(*). Its also worth noting[CR] that the Atma/Omega Weapon is[CR]still stripped of its special formula and[CR] treated like a normal weapon[CR]with 255 BatPwr if you use it with Mug or[CR] Jump, which may or may not be[CR]desirable depending on your situation.[CR] *Theres an actually an exception[CR](Setzers Dice) since FF6 was coded by[CR] monkeys, but its not really[CR]important and I dont think anyone[CR]cares[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]MP 4 Crits Weapons that consume MP for automatic critical hits now cost an[CR]amount[CR] ---------- equal to 1/2 the users level rather than [12...19]. This[CR]is important[CR] primarily because auto-crits are now a standard feature on[CR]rods to take[CR] advantage of an oddity in the games code that causes random[CR]spellcasts[CR] from them to also do critical damage - something that spells[CR]ordinarily[CR] cannot do. Combined with a new equipment feature which doubles[CR]the odds[CR] of a random spellcast occurring (from 25% to 50%), this allows[CR]rods to[CR] function as perfectly viable weapons for magically-inclined[CR]characters.[CR] A major caveat to the above, however, is that random spellcast[CR]damage is[CR] affected by row and 3/4 of BNWs rod users die in a gentle[CR]breeze. This[CR] can be bypassed with the Jump command, and random spellcast[CR]damage will[CR] receive the 50% damage boost from jumping, but the downside is[CR]that Jump[CR] also disables critical hits and critical hits have a higher[CR]damage boost[CR] (100%) than jumping with a rod does (Jump only provides the[CR]same damage[CR] boost as a critical hit when you do it with a spear).[CR] An[CR]astute reader may recognize the above bonuses as damage multipliers,[CR] and[CR]no doubt many of you are thinking (judging by the number of times I[CR] get[CR]asked this) that bserk would be the *perfect* way to boost your rod[CR] users[CR]damage. Except its not. Despite the fact that random spellcasts[CR] benefit[CR]from every *other* damage multiplier (MP-fueled criticals, Jump,[CR] Morph),[CR]BSERK DOES NOT AFFECT RANDOM SPELLCASTS. Blame Squaresoft.[CR] Spoil The Rod[CR]Speaking of poor coding practices, using a rod (or shield) as an item in[CR]the original game would cause the resulting spell to deal massive damage[CR]because all items are coded to ignore damage modifiers, namely defense.[CR]This has been fixed so that spells cast from rods used as items will do[CR]the same damage that they would have had the character cast it normally.[CR]Quartr/Doom Crits Because the random spellcasts on the Quartrstaff and[CR]Doomstick dont do[CR] "regular" damage, they are not affected by the[CR]bugs/"features" mentioned[CR] above. Thus, this hack allows Quartr to affect[CR]all enemies when randomly[CR] cast from an MP-fueled critical hit (it would[CR]normally only affect the[CR] target of the rod attack) while the Doomstick[CR]will instead cast X-Zone[CR] (rather than Doom) on a group of enemies under[CR]the same circumstances.[CR] Sword Crits Conversely to the above, the Holy and[CR]Flare spells are hard-coded *not*[CR] to deal critical damage when randomly[CR]cast from the Illumina/Apocalypse.[CR] More specifically, they are hard-coded[CR]to ignore damage multipliers to[CR] keep the Apocalypse/Illumina from being[CR]overwhelmingly OP; Flare not[CR] getting the Morph damage boost as a result is[CR]an unfortunate casualty.[CR] Always Load MP The game now always loads[CR]characters MP at the start of battle, even if[CR] the Magic command is not[CR]present. This allows Gogo to use his MP for rod[CR] attacks without needing[CR]Magic (or Lore) set as a command. It also has an[CR] unintended side effect of[CR]doing the same for Banon and the rod-wielding[CR] moogles in the opening[CR]battle to save Terra from the guards, although[CR] none of them possess enough[CR]MP for more than one critical hit.[CR] Always Halve MP The "MP for crits"[CR]property now respects the "1/2 MP costs" flag on the[CR] Gem Box/Soul[CR]Box.[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Random Number Good FF6s notoriously streaky Random Number Generator has been[CR]replaced with[CR] ------------------ a new one that wipes clean without[CR]leaving any streaks behind. Note that[CR] this is an updated version of the[CR]one that existed in previous versions[CR] of the mod (1.6 and prior) that adds[CR]in an extra layer of randomness to[CR] prevent/discourage RNG manipulation. As[CR]you could expect, this affects[CR] the games entire combat system to some[CR]extent, as well as many of the[CR] other hacks on this list (i.e. the ones[CR]concerning the odds of things).[CR] For example...[CR] Rage and Dance Odds The[CR]two attacks on each rage are now common (2/3 odds of being used) and[CR]uncommon (1/3 odds) instead of it being an even 50/50 chance. Similarly,[CR]the 2nd and 3rd steps of each dance now have 5/16 and 3/16 odds instead[CR] of[CR]6/16 and 2/16 (respectively). Both of these changes combine with an[CR]overhaul of the attacks involved, because diversity (its a thing now).[CR]Image Nerf The image status (also known as "blink") now has a 1/3 chance of[CR]being[CR] dispelled each time it blocks a physical attack (instead of[CR]1/4).[CR] Formation Odds The appearance probabilities of the last two enemy[CR]formations in a pack[CR] have been changed from 5/16 and 1/16 to 3/16 (each).[CR]This allows for a[CR] greater variety of enemy encounters, particularly in[CR]larger areas.[CR] Odds and Ends Finally, see below for a list of all random[CR]weapon and ability procs:[CR] RANDOM EFFECT ODDS[CR] ------------- ----[CR]Randomly casts spell 25% (50% w/ boost)[CR] Randomly hits as Wind Slash/Aero[CR]50%[CR] Randomly sets Stop/Slow (Kagenui) 50%[CR] Anti-Floating weapons*[CR]50%[CR] Anti-Undead weapons* 50% (undead only)[CR] Randomly kills 25% (100% if[CR]undead)[CR] Randomly cleaves/crits* (Zantetsuken) 25%[CR] Randomly steals[CR](Switchblade) 50%[CR] Randomly jumps twice (Dragon Helm) 25%[CR] Randomly sets[CR]"Stone" (Dragon bushido) 66%[CR] Randomly sets "Image" (Mirage) 50%[CR] *See[CR]"Random Weapon Effects" below for[CR]details[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Random Weapon Effects Several of the games "random" weapon effects have been[CR]modified in some[CR] --------------------- form or fashion, including...[CR]Zantetsuken The random "cleave" proc on the Zantetsuken now deals a critical[CR]hit to[CR] anything thats immune to instant death, thus increasing its[CR]usefulness[CR] against enemies other than trash mobs. As an interesting side-[CR]note, this[CR] wont prevent ordinary critical attacks from occurring,[CR]resulting in a[CR] 1/128 chance of a *double* critical hit.[CR] Chainsaw[CR]Massacre Similar to the above, the random "hockey mask" proc on the Chainsaw[CR]was[CR] altered so that the instant death effect is in addition to damage[CR]dealt[CR] rather than instead of it. Note that this is referred to as "cleave"[CR]in[CR] the printme even though it doesnt have the "cut into pieces"[CR]animation[CR] like the Zantetsuken or Cyans titular bushido do. This is in[CR]order to[CR] distinguish it from "randomly kills" property that heals undead[CR]enemies[CR] instead of killing them to (re)death.[CR] Anti-Undead Weapons Also[CR]distinct from "randomly kills" is the brand-new anti-undead feature[CR] on the[CR]Demonsbane shortsword and Setzers Tarot cards, described in-game[CR] simply as[CR]"strong vs. undead foes". What you get here is a 50% chance of[CR] instant[CR]death similar to "randomly kills", except that it only works on[CR] the[CR]undead. If the target is an undead *boss*, then it will instead deal[CR]critical damage (similar to how the Zantetsuken now works).[CR] Anti-Air[CR]Weapons Weapons with the "randomly throws" property (renamed to "strong[CR]against[CR] floating enemies" to avoid confusion with weapons that can be used[CR]with[CR] the "Throw" command) originally received a damage boost of 50%[CR]against[CR] non-floating enemies and 200% (triple damage) on floating ones[CR]when they[CR] were randomly "thrown". This large discrepancy rendered them a[CR]bit *too*[CR] powerful in the situations where they were useful and a bit too[CR]useless[CR] otherwise, and so the damage boost for grounded enemies has been[CR]raised[CR] to 100% and their battle powers have been re-balanced[CR]accordingly.[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]The X-Fight Effect The "Offering" effect, which is now on a Setzer-exclusive[CR]relic and a[CR] ------------------ Shadow-exclusive weapon, is set to make[CR]"Fight" a 2x targetable attack[CR] with a 25% damage penalty instead of a 4x[CR]untargetable attack with a 50%[CR] damage penalty. This was edited because[CR]Setzer possesses several weapons[CR] that either ignore the penalty (Dice) or[CR]otherwise dont rely on direct[CR] damage to be effective (Tarot, Doom Darts).[CR]On Shadows end, the damage[CR] penalty is ignored by the random Wind[CR]Slash/Aero procs of the Kazekiri[CR] and Mutsunokami, as well as the random[CR]spellcasts of the Sakura.[CR] Note that the new "X-Fight" also lacks three[CR]little-known properties of[CR] the original: it does not set attacks to "cant[CR]be dodged", it does not[CR] disable critical hits, and it no longer disables[CR]random spellcasts.[CR] X-Magic Counter The X-Magic command is now[CR]uninterrupted so that its no longer possible[CR] to provoke two counter-[CR]attacks from the same target with[CR]it.[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Throw Effects Weapons now retain special properties when used with "Throw",[CR]namely the[CR] ------------- "2x damage to humans" property of the Butterfly[CR]and Man Eater knives.[CR] (For those of you who are curious how Throw[CR]determines its damage, its[CR] basically a regular attack with the weapon[CR]being thrown that ignores the[CR] users row, the targets defense, and is given[CR]a 100% damage boost.)[CR] Gogo Throw Gogo can now still use Throw even if[CR]Shadow is no longer[CR]available.[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Bushido Blade Physical-damage bushido techniques (Dispatch, Flurry, and[CR]Tempest) now[CR] ------------- rely exclusively on the power of the equipped[CR]sword to determine their[CR] strength; their power levels are set to a given[CR]fraction of the users[CR] Battle Power (refer to the printme for[CR]specifics).[CR] SwordTech Charger Bushido (AKA "SwdTech") no longer takes a[CR]bloody lifetime to charge up[CR] (charge speed will increase as more[CR]techniques are[CR]learned).[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Treasure Hunting Steal/Mug no longer takes the level of the "treasure hunter"[CR]or victim[CR] ---------------- into consideration and is now just a straight-[CR]up roll against the RNG[CR] that uses the "hunter"s speed (% of success = (112[CR]+ Speed * 2) / 255).[CR] Speed also affects the likelihood of a rare steal[CR](Speed / 256) instead[CR] of the flat 1/8 chance in the original game, making[CR]them more common in[CR] the later game with a little bit of investment in[CR]Lockes speed.[CR] Quicksteal Further to the above, successful steal attempts[CR]are now treated by the[CR] game as a "free" action and will immediately refill[CR]the ATB gauge of the[CR] character who performed it (note that this also[CR]applies to random steal[CR] attempts made by a certain knife). This allows the[CR]"Mug" command to act[CR] as a multi-attack rather than just a regular one plus[CR]a theft attempt.[CR] Two Legs Good Finally, as I mentioned earlier, treasure[CR]hunting has been standardized[CR] so that only humanoid enemies have items for[CR]the taking. This not only[CR] made it easier for me to balance stealables[CR]since I had far fewer foes[CR] to work with, but it should also make it much[CR]easier for players to[CR] figure out which enemies are worth the effort to[CR]hunt[CR]from.[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Slot De-Rigging The Slots command is no longer rigged to force certain[CR]outcomes based on[CR] --------------- how the RNG is feeling - its now[CR]entirely timing-based, and the reels[CR] have been edited to group the symbols[CR]together, FF7-style:[CR] REEL 1 REEL 2 REEL 3[CR] ------ ------ ------[CR] 7 7[CR]7[CR] Bar Bar Bar[CR] Chocobo Blackjack Diamond[CR] Chocobo Blackjack[CR]Diamond[CR] Chocobo Blackjack Diamond[CR] Bar Bar Bar[CR] Bar Bar Bar[CR]Diamond Chocobo Blackjack[CR] Diamond Chocobo Blackjack[CR] Diamond Chocobo[CR]Blackjack[CR] Bar Bar Bar[CR] Bar Bar Bar[CR] Blackjack Diamond Chocobo[CR]Blackjack Diamond Chocobo[CR] Blackjack Diamond Chocobo[CR] Bar Bar Bar[CR]The two other changes worthy of note are that the Bar-Bar-7 "fuck you"[CR]spin has been disabled and Bar-Bar-Bar no longer forcibly passes over[CR] Odin[CR]as a potential random esper to be summoned.[CR] A list of Slots results and[CR]their effects can be found in the[CR]printme.[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Make It Rain The formula for GP Toss (AKA "GP Rain") has been reworked to not[CR]only[CR] ------------ make it an attack worth actually using, but to tempt an[CR]alternate build[CR] for your Setzer as the new formula quite strongly[CR]considers his stamina.[CR] OLD GP RAIN FORMULA[CR] -------------------[CR] GP[CR]Rained = Lv * 30[CR] Dmg = (GP Rained * 2) / # of foes[CR] NEW GP TOSS[CR]FORMULA[CR] -------------------[CR] GP Tossed = Stam * 10[CR] Dmg = (GP Tossed[CR]* Lv) / (2 * (# of targets + 1))[CR] Further, GP Toss has been designated as a[CR]"free targeting" attack (press[CR] L/R to target multiple foes) instead of[CR]being forcibly multi-targeted.[CR] This is a particularly important feature[CR]for GP Toss given its special[CR] damage split formula that penalizes damage[CR]output for every target hit[CR] rather than the flat 50% penalty used by all[CR](most) other[CR]attacks.[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Umaro Hit Hard Umaro has four attacks: a regular "Fight" attack and three[CR]special ones,[CR] -------------- two of which are enabled by specific relics.[CR]If you count the fact that[CR] his base stats and the battle power of his Bone[CR]Club have been adjusted,[CR] all four of them have been tweaked and/or fixed[CR]by this mod:[CR] ..."Tackle", which is always available, is basically just his[CR]regular[CR] fight command set to ignore defense. Because Umaros base battle[CR]power[CR] combined with that of his weapon give his regular attacks a maxed-[CR]out[CR] battle power of 255, this is basically his equivalent of Bum Rush.[CR]..."Rage", the "character toss" ability thats enabled by the Rage Belt,[CR]was initially just Tackle (a regular attack that ignores defense) set to[CR]add the battle power of the character being tossed to Umaros. However,[CR]since battle power is an 8-bit value (read: it caps at 255), this didnt[CR]end up being as significant as it was probably meant to be. It now has a[CR]set battle power of 255 (see above) with the "Gauntlet" bonus applied to[CR]it for an effective battle power of 382. Further, it now deals critical[CR]damage if the character thrown is Mog (as it was originally intended to[CR]do, but didnt due to a bug). As always, Umaro will prioritize throwing[CR]allies with the sleep or muddle statuses, as this attack removes them.[CR]..."Blizzard" (formerly "Storm"), which the Blizzard Orb relic enables,[CR] no[CR]longer does half damage (AKA "split loss") if more than one target is[CR]present. Its power has been lowered *slightly* (100 -&gt; 90), but Umaros[CR]stats more than make up for that. Note that this is the same "Blizzard"[CR]attack that appears in the Snowman Jazz dance (refer to the printme for[CR]details) with two notable distinctions. One, it uses Umaros stamina to[CR]determine its damage rather than his (rather abysmal) magic power. Two,[CR] it[CR]bypasses the enemy stamina check to see whether or not it sets slow.[CR]Attack Odds The odds of each attack being used have also been adjusted.[CR]Previously,[CR] they varied depending on whether Umaro had one or both of his[CR]special[CR] relics equipped - having both on was often undesirable as the odds[CR]of[CR] Rage or Storm being used were higher if only their one special relic[CR]was[CR] equipped. To simplify things, all three of Umaros special attacks[CR]now[CR] have a hard 76/255 (roughly 30%) chance of being used, otherwise[CR]Umaro[CR] will use his regular fight command. This gives fight a 179/255[CR]chance[CR] (roughly 70%) of being used if neither special relic is present,[CR]103/255[CR] odds (or 40%) if one is equipped, and 27/255 (10%) if both[CR]are.[CR] Bare Naked Yeti Finally, Umaros equip menu is no longer locked down[CR]so that you can now[CR] (un)equip him just like a normal character. Of course,[CR]he still has zero[CR] options aside from what he starts out with - this change[CR]was made purely[CR] to correct a bug in the original game wherein the "unequip[CR]all of your[CR] d00ds" dude wouldnt take Umaros relics away since it would[CR]also remove[CR] his other equipment (that youd then have no way to get back on[CR]him).[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Defend Buff The "defend" battle command now halves both physical and magical[CR]damage[CR] ----------- instead of just physical damage. This is a rather[CR]important hack for the[CR] crazies who are trying for a level one Gogo (and[CR]yes, its been[CR]done).[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Status Display This is a collection of hacks that greatly improve how the game[CR]conveys[CR] -------------- the presence of status effects in battle to the[CR]player.[CR] Status Auras Removes the glowing auras from the safe, shell, and[CR]reflect statuses.[CR] Because only one aura can be displayed at a time,[CR]buffing your party to[CR] any significant degree otherwise quickly devolves[CR]into a confusing mass[CR] of bright colors wherein only the status with the[CR]highest priority will[CR] be displayed. The three statuses which are still[CR]represented with auras[CR] are either unable to coexist on the same target[CR](haste and slow) or will[CR] otherwise completely override the other two for[CR]its duration (stop).[CR] Targeting Panel When choosing a friendly target for[CR]an item or spell in battle, a panel[CR] appears to display any status effect[CR]present on each character. Similar[CR] to the problem with auras, only one[CR]status could be displayed here at a[CR] time and the order in which the 25(!)[CR]possible results were prioritized[CR] was questionable at best. This panel now[CR]displays *only* the presence of[CR] any combination of the safe, shell, and[CR]reflect statuses.[CR] Rerise On ATB So, that list of 25 possible status[CR]effects I mentioned a second ago?[CR] Well, rerise (AKA "Life 3") is dead[CR]fucking last on the priority list -[CR] strange, given that it has absolutely[CR]no visual indication unlike, say,[CR] float, muddle, blink, imp... or[CR]literally everything else that will take[CR] precedence over it being shown.[CR]Its almost like this game was coded by[CR] idiots or something.[CR] The[CR]presence of the rerise status on a party member is now indicated by[CR] their[CR]ATB bar turning green while charging (it still turns yellow when[CR] full).[CR]Needless to say, the effects of this change are lost if the ATB[CR] gauge is[CR]disabled in the config menu.[CR] Status Scan Finally, since enemies arent[CR]exactly as forthcoming about their current[CR] status as your characters are,[CR]the Scan spell will now display all of a[CR] targets status effects has in[CR]addition to its weaknesses. This can be[CR] useful, for example, for figuring[CR]out whether or not you remembered to[CR] put Slow on a boss (or for figuring[CR]out why Slow wont work[CR]it).[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]HP/MP Text Color Text coloration in battle will now change to indicate MP[CR]damage (red) or[CR] ---------------- healing (blue). A side effect of this[CR]patch is that it also alters the[CR] color of the "reflect" shield when[CR]attacks are bounced off of it due to[CR] the fact that the MP healing is[CR]piggybacking off of the same palette as[CR] reflect uses. This also means that[CR]the MP healing font is susceptible to[CR] the same little-known bug as reflect[CR]wherein the coloring gets fucked up[CR] for the duration of any fight in which[CR]Crusader is summoned.[CR] Bad Decoration This fixes the Crusader redecorates[CR]reflect barriers[CR]bug.[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Original Graphics Restores the following sprites to their original[CR](uncensored) versions:[CR] -----------------[CR] Siren[CR] Goddess[CR]Chadarnook[CR] Critic[CR] Barb-E/Madam/Dahling[CR] (Note that most of these[CR]have been renamed)[CR] This hack is omitted from the "clean" version of Brave[CR]New[CR]World.[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]New Window Style Added a new window style as the default one, with the old[CR]default style[CR] ---------------- replacing #8 (which was used only by[CR]assholes and mental[CR]patients).[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Menu Item Sorting Using the "arrange" command in the inventory now sorts item[CR]types in a[CR] ----------------- manner that actually makes some fucking[CR]sense:[CR] NEW ORDER: OLD ORDER:[CR] -------------- --------------[CR] Tool[CR]Dagger[CR] Throwing Star Sword[CR] Ninja Scroll Spear[CR] Dagger Katana[CR]Sword Rod[CR] Spear Brush[CR] Claw Throwing Star[CR] Katana "Other" Weapon[CR]Casino Weapon Casino Weapon[CR] Rod Claw[CR] Brush Shield[CR] "Other" Weapon[CR]Helmet[CR] Shield Armor[CR] Helmet Tool[CR] Armor Ninja Scroll[CR] Relic[CR]Relic[CR] Alphabetical Rage In addition to all of the other changes weve made[CR]to make Rage the best[CR] skill it can be, weve also utilized a patch that[CR]sorts all of his rages[CR] alphabetically instead of by their order in the[CR]code. Another new patch[CR] condenses the list of rages in the skills submenu[CR]to use only the first[CR] 64 slots (the total number of rages in BNW) instead[CR]of all 256.[CR] Alphabetical Lore Lores are also listed alphabetically now, as[CR]well as condensed in the[CR] menu. Neither of these are due to a hack, however[CR]- I just manually[CR] re-arranged them in the spell index.[CR] Compact Spell[CR]List Finally, the "magic" menu for each character is now condensed in[CR]battle[CR] to remove the empty spaces that previously existed due to the[CR]nature of[CR] how the code dynamically generated the lists of known[CR]spells.[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Obscure Menu Hacks This is a collection of lesser-visible edits to the menu[CR]screen.[CR] ------------------[CR] Overlay and MP Costs This removes the small[CR]overlay which identifies the skill submenus (i.e.[CR] Espers, Spells,[CR]Bushido...) because it was unnecessary and it obscured[CR] the lower-right[CR]portion of the information panel above it (the mod makes[CR] use of this real[CR]estate whereas vanilla did not). The only useful piece[CR] of information that[CR]appeared in this overlay was the MP cost of a chosen[CR] spell; spell costs[CR]are now visible by default in the main menu panel.[CR] (I say "by default"[CR]above because a little-known feature of the original[CR] game is that you can[CR]press "Y" in the spell menu to toggle MP costs in[CR] the main panel; whats[CR]shown by default is the spell percentage learned,[CR] which isnt exactly[CR]useful/relevant information in Brave New World.)[CR] Esper Equip Screen[CR]Speaking of little-known features in the original game, a summary of the[CR]partys equipment can be viewed by selecting the equip or relic menu[CR]options, pressing L/R to select the entire party, and then pressing left[CR]on the D-pad. This screen has been edited in our mod to also show your[CR]equipped espers, since theyre now an important part of your load-out.[CR] Y[CR]Equip Relics Quickly switch between the equip and relic menus with the "Y"[CR]button.[CR] Unequipium This fixes a bug wherein characters max HP/MP values[CR]would not update[CR] after removing equipment that boosts it until they were[CR]in active party,[CR] leading to incorrect values being shown on the party[CR]creation screen.[CR] Blitz Screen Blitz names are now displayed in the menu[CR]instead of just the inputs.[CR] Yellow Streak Fix This removes the small[CR]yellow line that appears in Gogos command[CR]menu.[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Optimize/Hotswap Ban Because the "optimize" command only considers raw[CR]defense/battle power,[CR] -------------------- its generally a poor judge of[CR]usefulness - especially given the many[CR] other benefits that most equipment[CR]now has. This is the *actual* reason[CR] for disabling the command, although[CR]our justification is that it didnt[CR] play nicely with the "dual wield"[CR]property on weapons.[CR] The other function that didnt jibe well with baking[CR]the "dual-wield"[CR] property into weapons was the ability to swap out them[CR]and/or shields in[CR] mid-battle. Unlike optimize, which we were all too glad[CR]to take out back[CR] and put down, we were actually kind of sad to see this[CR]one go. Not sad[CR] enough to try and fix it, mind, but still kind of sad[CR]nonetheless.[CR] Optimize Fix The only instances in Brave New World where the[CR]optimize code is still[CR] used are when Edgar and Terra are force-equipped[CR]when they re-join you[CR] immediately prior to boss battles, and we utilized[CR]an external patch to[CR] prevent it from doing shit like making Edgar wear a[CR]drill as a hat.[CR] (Also, it no longer ignores the Blood Sword and Soul[CR]Sabre.)[CR] Shop Display In the same spirit as axing optimize because weapons[CR]and armor are now[CR] much more than their primary stats, so too have we done[CR]away with the[CR] symbols that appear when buying equipment that compares it[CR]to what you[CR] already have equipped. Again, since only raw battle[CR]power/defense was[CR] considered, we felt that the partial information it[CR]provided was worse[CR] than none at all. Players are encouraged to use the[CR]printme to look up[CR] information about equipment or, failing that, the[CR]extended information[CR] panel in your inventory screen (double-click on a[CR]piece of equipment to[CR] display who can use it, then press left on your[CR]D-pad to see its[CR]stats).[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Rewards Display The Colosseum menu now displays the prize for any item wagered[CR]without[CR] --------------- having to commit to the wager beforehand.[CR] Note[CR]that the Colosseum has been completely reworked and standardized to[CR] make[CR]it more obvious/intuitive what items can be wagered to win fabulous[CR] prizes[CR]and what will simply earn you a date with Mr. Chupon. Simply put,[CR] any item[CR]with no resale value is considered rare and can be bet at the[CR] Colosseum -[CR]everything else is not rare and wins you literally[CR]nothing.[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]MP Party Restore The "choose a party screen" now restores the MP of all[CR]characters to max[CR] ---------------- instead of just HP. This was done[CR]primarily to act as a full party heal[CR] prior to the Battle of Narshe,[CR]though its also a good convenience hack.[CR] Not only does it remove the need[CR]to visit an inn after swapping out your[CR] team, but it also affects picking[CR]a character to fight in the[CR]Colosseum.[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]NoGainz There is now an option in the config menu to disable exp. gains (and,[CR]by[CR] ------- extension, spell point and EP gains) from battle. This feature[CR]is mostly[CR] intended for challenge gamers trying a low-level game, but can[CR]also be[CR] useful for someone who just wants to farm for GP without over-[CR]leveling.[CR] (NOTE: this option is NOT a challenge to the size of your penis.[CR]Anyone[CR] who leaves this option on and then bitches to us about how hard the[CR]mod[CR] is will be laughed at/ridiculed and then told to gain a fucking[CR]level.)[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Get Back Here, Shadow! Shadow wont randomly run off on you anymore at any[CR]point during Sabins[CR] ---------------------- scenario or if you hire him in[CR]Kohlingen. Hes also kind enough now to[CR] leave all of his shit behind when[CR]he leaves you at Baren Falls.[CR] Zozo Unequip Further to the above, everyone[CR]is force-unequipped after the scene with[CR] Ramuh at Zozo so that nobody[CR](Shadow &gt;.&gt;) runs off with your shit. Note[CR] that, with this change, THERE[CR]ARE NO MORE INSTANCES OF SOMEONE RUNNING[CR] OFF WITH ANY OF YOUR STUFF, so[CR]dont worry about it anymore, k?[CR] Scenario Unequip In a similar, though less[CR]severe case of the above, Locke and Celes are[CR] now unequipped at the end of[CR]their scenario. This removes the incentive[CR] to put it off until last since[CR]it no longer "locks" your best equipment[CR] into two characters you wont be[CR]seeing again for a little while.[CR] Arvis Unequip Finally, Arvis is now an[CR]unequip dude following the Battle of Narshe, so[CR] you dont have to go to the[CR]trouble of forming a party of everyone whos[CR] *not* going to Zozo just so[CR]you can take all of their shit[CR]off.[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]B Button Dash Obsoletes Sprint Shoes by adding a dash button (B). Note that[CR]this patch[CR] ------------- has been modified from the original version to[CR]disallow dashing during[CR] the following points in the game where dashing was[CR]originally disabled:[CR] The opening sequence (Magitek raid on Narshe)[CR] Any[CR]*other* time youre wearing Magitek armor)[CR] The "Save Terra" sequence (the[CR]moogle battle)[CR] The Battle of Narshe[CR] Celess opera solo[CR] Daryls Tomb[CR](the stair/flashback sequence)[CR] This patch has also been *further* modified[CR]to replace the now-useless[CR] optimize/empty slot in the config menu with the[CR]option to make running[CR] the default speed (where holding B will make you[CR]walk at normal speed).[CR] Fancy Walking Characters now continue taking poison[CR]damage whilst walking diagonally[CR] (i.e. up or down stairs), whereas they[CR]originally[CR]didnt.[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Save and Restore In response to the fact that the ability to save the game at[CR]any time is[CR] -------------- a feature of the software required to play this[CR]mod in the first place,[CR] we made the active decision to shift Brave New[CR]Worlds difficulty model[CR] away from save denial (which, frankly, died out[CR]with blast processing)[CR] and more toward inventory management with the[CR]following changes:[CR] Several save points have been added to key areas[CR]Some save points are now also "full recovery" points[CR] Tents and sleeping[CR]bags have been removed from the game[CR] In short, recovery items are now more[CR]important since you cant just pop[CR] a tent just before every boss fight, and[CR]saving the game is a tool meant[CR] to prevent you from losing huge amounts of[CR]time to fuckups. To that end,[CR] the time-honored advice of "save early and[CR]often" holds true becuase...[CR] Game Over, Man! Death in battle now kicks you[CR]back to the menu screen instead of to your[CR] last save. This was done[CR]because, while this would retain all experience[CR] gained, it would not[CR]retain any esper boosts (and thats[CR]bad).[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]5. BUGS and KNOWN[CR]ISSUES[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]During certain battles, most notably the Cranes, the menu cursor will become[CR]difficult to see or[CR] disappear entirely - this is an emulator issue and has[CR]absolutely nothing to do with the mod[CR] (ditto for off-screen characters[CR]appearing layered over the HUD during in-battle cutscenes)[CR] Another[CR]emulator-specific issue involves the battle interface randomly "flashing"[CR]whenever an[CR] action is about to take place; this seems related to using the[CR]SNES9x Next (AKA SNES9x 201) core[CR] with RetroArch and can be fixed be[CR]switching to standard SNES9x[CR] More so here than in the original game,[CR]renaming your characters (especially those with short[CR] names like Cyan,[CR]Gau, and Mog) can result in weird formatting in dialogue boxes; the ones[CR]that[CR] appear during battle cutscenes are notable offenders since they dont[CR]wrap normally and can[CR] potentially result in text overrunning the dialogue[CR]window[CR] Inherent statuses (i.e. regen from the Life Bell) will not[CR]initialize properly on characters who[CR] are dead at the beginning of the[CR]battle, and they will be immune to that status for the duration[CR] of it;[CR]further, the transitions during the Ifrit/Shiva and Chadarnook battles will[CR]trigger this[CR] bug for any character who is dead when they occur (or fix it[CR]if they are brought back to life)[CR] When Gau (or Gogo) rages an enemy with a[CR]single-target move that affects friendlies (Soldier,[CR] Conjurer, Repo Man,[CR]Flan, Witch) during a side attack, he will never target his allies on the[CR]opposite side; this is due to the "one side only" targeting flag that such[CR]spells all have set[CR] Physical Rage attacks that set sleep (Raven and Eye[CR]Goo) will reportedly always miss on enemies[CR] with large sprites; this one[CR]is particularly difficult to nail down due to its transient nature[CR] and[CR]tendency to randomly fix iteself in the process of troubleshooting it[CR] Gau[CR]occasionally likes to slowly creep forward across the battlefield until hes[CR]all up in your[CR] enemies shit; Im fairly certain this is a carry-over from[CR]vanilla thats being exacerbated by[CR] something weve done, but I havent the[CR]foggiest idea what and I dont care enough to find out[CR] A variant of the[CR]above bug can be seen by summoning Phoenix against enemies with large[CR]sprites;[CR] again, this is a vanilla bug and large enemy sprites seem to be a[CR]common denominator with them[CR] Another hold-over from vanilla: foes will[CR]retain the imp sprite if cured by anything other than[CR] the titular spell;[CR]only three enemies (Griffin/Osprey and Tumbleweed) are capable of doing[CR]this[CR] As was (again) the case in vanilla, floating, vanished targets will[CR]still be stripped of their[CR] "clear" status if a ground-based non-physical[CR]attack (i.e. Quake) misses them[CR] When the Quartrstaff multi-targets its[CR]spell proc on an MP-fueled autocrit, it will target *all*[CR] enemies -[CR]including ones who are already dead - due to the way that the targeting is[CR]hard-coded[CR] Treasure chests containing key items (such as the ones at Ebots[CR]Rock) will close if you go into[CR] the menu screen and will be empty if you[CR]attempt to re-open them; this is another vanilla bug[CR] If the first battle[CR]with Ultros ends while Edgar in the air (Jump is available much earlier in[CR]Brave New World than in vanilla), the following cutscene will play out without[CR]him[CR] There have been occasional reports of the rich mans house at South[CR]Figaro experiencing slightly[CR] high load times during Lockes scenario; we[CR]have absolutely no fucking clue why[CR] This little gem:[CR]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BaY8C_4TJM[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]6. VERSION[CR]HISTORY[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Version 1.9.0 (January 06, 2018)[CR] Added new hacks which allow stamina to[CR]influence counter-attacks and the possibility of "true knight"[CR] characters[CR]taking hits for healthy allies (critically-wounded characters are still always[CR]protected)[CR] Fixed a bug where stamina would not protect against status[CR]ailments set by enemy "special" attacks[CR] Added a hack to condense the in-[CR]battle spell menu (removes all empty spaces)[CR] Fucked around with the spells[CR]that each character learns again (highlights: Relm gets Life and Stop,[CR] Mog[CR]picks up Haste, Celes learns Demi much earlier now, and Warp is again pushed[CR]back to the WoR)[CR] The Life spell now revives to 250~500 HP instead of 1/4[CR]maxHP; Phoenix Downs now revive to 1 HP[CR] Raised Cyans base stamina; lowered[CR]the power of the Dragon and Eclipse bushidos to compensate[CR] Raised the[CR]chances for the Dragon bushido to set Stone from 50% to 66%[CR] Raised the[CR]power of the Aurabolt blitz and swapped the levels at which it and Mantra are[CR]learned[CR] Edited the GP Toss formula to do 50% more damage (note: edited[CR]Katanasouls stats to compensate)[CR] Lowered the power of the Blackjack and[CR]Solitaire slot spins[CR] Lowered the cost of several spells, including Demi,[CR]Rasp, Dispel, and SleepX[CR] Lowered the hitrate of several magical attacks to[CR]help make magic evasion more useful[CR] Reworked and rebalanced swords to[CR]offer more (and better) choices for vigor-built characters[CR] Swords that[CR]consume MP for critical hits now respect the "1/2 MP costs" effect of the[CR]Gem/Soul Box[CR] Spears now inherently possess the "may guard allies" property[CR]instead of random counter-attacks[CR] Adjusted the properties of the Wind[CR]Slash and Aero procs from the Kazekiri and Mutsunokami[CR] Removed the[CR]Kagenuis speed boost and slightly adjusted the boosts on Shadows other[CR]weapons[CR] Changed Setzers dice to boost stamina instead of magic and vise-[CR]versa for his other weapons[CR] The Morning Star and Kusarigama now ignore[CR]defense instead of being anti-undead[CR] The Demonsbane is now anti-undead in[CR]addition to holy-elemental[CR] Raised the proc rate of anti-undead weapons[CR]from 25% to 50%[CR] Fixed a bug where using items on undead characters would[CR]randomly kill them[CR] Renamed the Diva Brush to Dali Brush and the Magic[CR]Brush to Monet Brush[CR] Changed the animation of several weapons; also[CR]swapped the animations of the two "Blizzard" attacks[CR] Corrected the[CR]Stormfang menu description[CR] The BatPwr of the Soul Sabre and Omega Weapon[CR]now display correctly in the item menu[CR] The Soul Sabre/Blood Sword are no[CR]longer ignored by the "Optimize" routine; the Omega Weapon now is[CR] Switched[CR]the Colosseum opponents/prizes for the Masamune and Kagenui (and a few[CR]others)[CR] Celes now starts with an Iron Cutlass instead of a Mythril[CR]Bolo[CR] Gogo can now use Throw even if Shadow is dead[CR] Interceptor now[CR]sets Sap[CR] Lowered Golems defense from 192 to 128[CR] Made several changes[CR]to the Battle of Narshe[CR] Made an important update to Atma Weapons[CR]script[CR] Fixed a bug in the Soul Fire script (Wrexsoul fight)[CR]Enabled/disabled random encounters on a few maps for better consistency[CR]Aquilas no longer have any MP as they do not use any attacks that use it[CR]Phunbaba and Doom Gaze now give 10 spell points when defeated as other bosses[CR]do[CR] Fixed a bug where it was not possible to run from all of the enemies in[CR]the New Mines[CR] Rewrote Gaus tutorial to match how Leap now functions; also[CR]added a new line of dialogue for Gau[CR] Added more screenshots, boxart with[CR]cart label, and enemy graphics to the unlockme image[CR]gallery[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Older Versions[CR] Release notes for older versions are located at:[CR]http://btb2.free.fr/mods/ff6/Version.txt[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]7.

Youre sort of like the Dave[CR]Murray of NG+ if[CR] Dave Murray was constantly giving his bandmates horrible[CR]ideas that they wish theyd never had.[CR] I just want you to know that you are[CR]solely responsible for every line in Clean New World thats[CR] actually[CR]dirtier than the ones they replace.[CR] Advent[CR] ------[CR] I cant even[CR]begin to count the number of players that were turned on to Brave New World[CR]between[CR] you and Stann pimping it out to anyone looking for a fun mod to[CR]play. You help keep my forum...[CR] how should I say this... entertaining, and[CR]Im really glad knowing that I always have someone to[CR] talk to if I need it.[CR]Thanks a lot, man. Seriously.[CR] Anima Zero[CR] ----------[CR] It says a lot[CR]that whenever Im looking for a quick opinion, youre one of the first people[CR]that[CR] I always think to ask. Your perspective as a challenge gamer that has[CR]somehow managed to retain[CR] your precious, precious sanity means a lot to[CR]me. Youve taught me that real men take down Randy[CR] "Macho Man" Savage at[CR]level 3 and that Wrexsoul is a little bitch who needs to die before he can[CR]even move. Youve taught me that Gogo is horribly broken and probably always[CR]will be (though at[CR] least a little less so than he was before). And most[CR]importantly, youve taught me that platonic[CR] love *can* exist between two[CR]grown men (no, wait, that was Waynes World).[CR] So, just those first two[CR]things, then.[CR] Bishop[CR] ------[CR] Thank you so much for lending your[CR]extensive knowledge of Ye Olde Broken English to our efforts[CR] in making[CR]Cyan actually speak like the developers intended. And beyond that, thank you[CR]just for[CR] being an awesome member of the community and a great friend to[CR]talk to about Buffy or just what[CR] ever happens to be bothering me at the[CR]moment. I hereby dub thee Pope Woolsey IX, because just[CR] "Pope Woolsey the[CR]First" doesnt really seem to command much authority.[CR] Also, we are no[CR]longer accepting bug reports from you. I dont know what you did to your ROM[CR]and[CR] I dont *want* to know.[CR] DN[CR] --[CR] Menu hacking is an absolute[CR]pain in the ass (or so Im told), so its greatly appreciated that[CR] you are[CR]practically pulling menu hacks out of your ass. You and Think have done so[CR]much for our[CR] mod at this point that youre practically unofficial members[CR]of the team. I sincerely hope that[CR] your work for us has in some way helped[CR]or inspired your work for your own mod, and I hope that[CR] you can pull[CR]through the trials life has sent your way and find your true calling one[CR]day.[CR] Funnyman[CR] --------[CR] Dude, I dont even know where to start.[CR]Youve shown a degree of dedication to this mod thats[CR] exceeded only[CR]possibly by my own. I cant tell you how many nights I spent during[CR]development[CR] (and still even now) obsessing over the tiniest details of[CR]game balance and wondering if it all[CR] would ever end up making a[CR]difference, and you more than anyone else have made me feel like my[CR]efforts were not in vain. I really wish that we had more beta testers like[CR]you, because youre[CR] pretty much a game designers dream (or, at least a[CR]*good* game designers dream).[CR] Hart Hunt[CR] ---------[CR] You may not have[CR]played Brave New World as much as much everyone else Im mentioning has[CR](except[CR] for Arch, I suppose), but youve given me just as much moral[CR]support - if not far more. Youre[CR] like the Ma-Ti of ID if Ma-Ti was totally[CR]metal and not a huge pussy. Seriously, youre one of[CR] the kindest people Ive[CR]ever met. Dont ever change \m/[CR] Lockirby[CR] --------[CR] You crazy,[CR]masochistic bastard. You were the first one to take a mod I thought was[CR]unbreakable[CR] and break it like a fucking Bethesda game. And since[CR]apparently even that wasnt enough for you,[CR] you did it all over again while[CR]blindfolded. If Ive learned at all anything from you, its that[CR] no matter[CR]how hard I try to keep people from breaking my mod, people will just keep[CR]trying to do[CR] it anyway. And honestly, watching them succeed is half the[CR]fun (the other half is the inevitable[CR] fan art of Celes committing suicide[CR]by smashing herself over the head with a morning star).[CR] Mishrak[CR]-------[CR] First and foremost, thanks for the Excel lessons. Its not often[CR]that I pick up skills with my[CR] hobby that are actually useful outside of[CR]it. Beyond that, thanks for that awesome character[CR] planner you made (and[CR]accepting my humble input with it), for one of the funniest moments Ive[CR]ever seen on a non-GDQ stream, and for all the exposure Brave New World ended[CR]up getting as a[CR] result. Lastly, thanks just for being a great friend to us[CR]and a member of the community that[CR] were always glad to have around; your[CR]attitude gives us all something to aspire to.[CR] Nakar[CR] -----[CR] Ive read[CR]your build guide more times than I care to admit (also, I stole a lot of what[CR]I wrote[CR] in the character descriptions from it. Thanks for that &gt;.&gt;) Youve[CR]helped me understand so much[CR] about my own mod and continue to provide me[CR]and the rest of the community with a great wealth of[CR] information that I[CR]know Brave New World is much better off for having.[CR] Nowea[CR] -----[CR]More and more these days, youve come in my eyes to represent the average[CR]player in a community[CR] full of insane challenge gamers and masochists.[CR]Youre always willing to offer a humble opinion,[CR] and Im thankful for all of[CR]the problems weve been able to address as a direct result of having[CR] seen[CR]you suffer through them. Youre kind of like the Job of our community,[CR]really.[CR] Secondadvent (AKA "Revenge of the Advent")[CR]------------------------------------------[CR] You just love finding broken[CR]shit in our mod, dont you? I wouldve been perfectly happy never[CR] knowing[CR]that Quicksand worked on bosses since nobody except you would ever think to[CR]dance the[CR] Desert Aria against a fucking tonberry. Also, I think youre the[CR]only person to have actually[CR] legitimately found the WoB Refract backdoor,[CR]which only furthers my belief that you are a[CR] sorcerer and I thus now fear[CR]you. Please dont turn me into a toad :([CR] Stann[CR] -----[CR] Youre one of[CR]the first people I met at Insane Difficulty, and definitely one of the those[CR]who[CR] convinced me that it was a place worth sticking around. Your help with[CR]testing pretty much every[CR] major release thus far has been greatly[CR]appreciated, and your perspective as a smart player who[CR] actually knows[CR]what hes doing, yet just wants to have some fun while playing a game has[CR]been[CR] invaluable in helping us to fine-tune this thing and make it the very[CR]best that it can be.[CR] Think[CR] -----[CR] You went *way* above the call of[CR]duty on this, dude. At this point, you have easily contributed[CR] more work[CR]to this project than anyone who isnt named BTB or Synchysi. I cant think of[CR]anything[CR] else to say except thank you and Ive got a fence that I think[CR]youll have a blast[CR]painting.[CR]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]...looking for the guys responsible for this mess?[CR] btb@abusemynipples.biz[CR](BTB)[CR] synchysi@yahoo.com (Synchysi)[CR] Please feel free to contact us[CR]with your questions, feedback, comments, concerns, observations,[CR]complaints, insults, ridicule, screeds, japes, thrusts, death threats, and[CR]marriage proposals.[CR] Or better yet, visit any of our discussion[CR]forums...[CR] http://www.ngplus.net/index.php?/forums/forum/3-mods/[CR]http://www.ff6hacking.com/forums/showthread.php?tid=3298[CR]http://www.insanedifficulty.com/board/index.php?app=forums[CR] ...or join us[CR]on Discord: https://discord.gg/eHVZ9xW[CR] Is liking things on Facebook your[CR]bag, baby?

    <plot>Back when Final Fantasy VI (Final Fantasy III US) was released the game was[CR]heavily toned down, censoring graphics and the like. When it was re-released[CR]for the Playstation, the graphics were uncensored but toned down script[CR]remained. Then came Final Fantasy VI Advance with a newer (though some[CR]consider drier) translation, but the color palette and music were altered for[CR]the handheld console. Others have made re-translations, such as the great work[CR]by RPGOne, Lina Darkstar, and Kwhazit. Now this is Final Fantasy VI: Ted[CR]Woolsey Uncensored Editon. The goal was to make the SNES version uncut and to[CR]clean up the script but keep the nuance used by Woolsey in the original game's[CR]release. Using the original Woolsey script as a basis to analyze, the entire[CR]game was looked through, line by line, using FFVI Advance, RPGOne, and Lina[CR]Darkstar to accomplish this. Recently, the game's script was also heavily[CR]analyzed by Kwhazit and Mato (Legends of Localization). With these newer and[CR]more heavily detailed looks into the game, the script was again updated to[CR]provide a much more accurate version while still remaining true to the[CR]original game's release. Also used was various tools and patches to uncensor[CR]the graphics, restore Character Class names, extend spell names, rename[CR]monsters and items, and make hopefully the version of Final Fantasy VI that[CR]everyone will play. Any bug fixes or additions that were used were chosen not[CR]for any balance changes, but to fix persistent issues in the game, as to not[CR]change the experience of the original too much. This even includes the long[CR]list used in the optional Bug-Fix versions of the game. Additional Add-Ons are[CR]also optionally included. These tweaks bring an overall complete experience[CR]that many would say should have been in the original game to begin with. The[CR]Music Player included with the game has been altered for compatibility with[CR]Ted Woolsey Uncensored Edition. Please refer to the additional patches read-me[CR]for details. Please be sure to report any issues in the forum discussion. Join[CR]in on the discussion[CR][here.](http://www.romhacking.net/forum/index.php/topic,16476.0.html)</plot>

    <plot>The Final Fantasy VI Relocalization Project is an attempt to "relocalize" the[CR]Super Nintendo game Final Fantasy VI in a way that the original localization[CR]team might have done, if they had more time, ROM space, and freedom from[CR]censorship to do better.

    <plot>Samus Returns again for her third adventure, but things aren't quite the same[CR]this time around... Relive the amazing Super Metroid in a whole new light![CR]Hyper Metroid is a complete overhaul of the original game, featuring: * A dark[CR]twist on the original Metroid story-line * A brand new zebes to explore with[CR]several brand new areas * A new, highly customized weapon system featuring[CR]JAM's Spazer + Plasma * Grime's fast paced, highly fluid Project Base used as[CR]a base for the game * carefully balanced difficulty to satisfy all ranges of[CR]players OFFICIAL HOME PAGE FOR PROJECT [CR]Read Me:[CR]i&gt;&gt;?[CR]HYPER[CR]METROID[CR] v1.00[CR]by Trevor RealRed Sitkoff[CR]Design[CR]Philosophy:[CR]As an avid fan of Super Metroid, Ive played quite a few[CR]romhacks of the game. Some were really impressive in some cases,[CR]but almost[CR]all were incredibly frustrating and/or poorly designed in some way. One hack,[CR]Project Base, was a wildly[CR]derivative version of the original game with a[CR]completely new palette, modified levels for new routes of access to powerups,[CR]and[CR]several new abilities and movements added to Samuss arsenal. After[CR]playing it, I simply had to hack again.[CR]Originally, I was simply inspired[CR]by this hack to make a small set of levels that would utilize this fantastic[CR]new set of moves,[CR]but as I worked on the project, it became larger and[CR]expanded in all directions.[CR]I realized I could focus on eliminating issues[CR]that plagued other hacks of the game. Overpowered enemies,[CR]poorly planned[CR]clunky level design, powerups being withheld simply because the player would[CR]enjoy having them...[CR]With a close focus on a detailed world,[CR]maneuverability, and just having fun, Hyper Metroid is the Metroid game that[CR]Ive[CR]always wished that I could play. Hopefully, its equally satisfying to[CR]you as well.[CR]----------------------[CR]Table of Contents:[CR]I.[CR]Introduction[CR]II. Controls[CR]III. Exploring Planet Zebes[CR]IV. Power[CR]Up![CR]V. Installation/Setup[CR]VI. Credits[CR]VII.[CR]Contact[CR]----------------------[CR]I. Introduction[CR]K2L was a peaceful[CR]earth colony geared towards research in cutting-edge technology.[CR]Samus Aran[CR]was the lead engineer on site, whose innovations were groundbreaking.[CR]She[CR]was successful, and happily married, soon to start a family with her husband,[CR]Adam Aran.[CR]Her success, however, did not go unnoticed.[CR]The Space Pirates[CR]are an advanced alien species who rule the galaxy with unrivaled weapon[CR]technology.[CR]With overwhelming military forces, the incredibly strategic[CR]artificial intelligence Mother Brain,[CR]and the ruthless, cunning, and[CR]merciless leader, Ridley, few galactic civilizations live without[CR]the[CR]looming threat and fear of the Space Pirates. Fewer yet that could keep[CR]the threat at bay.[CR]One fateful day, Ridley launched a full assault on the[CR]K2L Colony in order to steal Samus most recent[CR]invention. Their operation[CR]was almost a complete success. Schematics stolen, prototypes taken, and[CR]nobody[CR]living to speak about what happened...[CR]Except for[CR]Samus.[CR]Rescued by the Galactic Federation, Samus was in poor condition.[CR]Critically injured and her unborn child, dead.[CR]After a long recovery, Samus[CR]had nothing to return to, and swore vengeance upon the Space Pirates.[CR]She[CR]began researching and constructing her own version of Chozo Power Suit[CR]technology; that of a long gone but[CR]incredibly advanced civilization of[CR]humanoid birds.[CR]Now with the unrestricted ability to explore even the most[CR]dangerous environments, Samus could begin her hunt.[CR]The Space Pirates would[CR]pay.[CR]Her first mission was at a space pirate base she had located, the[CR]presumed location of the[CR]brains of their operation, Mother Brain. She[CR]succeeded in destroying the Mother Brain, but it was a decoy.[CR]She had,[CR]however, learned of the Space Pirates plan to utilize the organisms known as[CR]Metroids for[CR]the manufacturing of biological weapons.[CR]She then went to[CR]planet SR388 to eliminate all of the metroids in order to put a halt on their[CR]current plans.[CR]While she was there, however, she witnessed the birth of a[CR]larva metroid, and could not bring herself to dispatch it.[CR]Instead, she[CR]chose to plant the Metroid where the Space Pirates would find it, using it to[CR]track down their base of operations.[CR]And so it begins. Samus is on her way[CR]to the Ceres Space Colony ready to begin what could be her most[CR]dangerous[CR]mission yet....[CR]----------------------[CR]II. Controls[CR]Up:[CR]Aim up[CR]Down: Crouch, morph[CR]Left: Walk left[CR]Right: Walk right[CR]A:[CR]Run/Action. holding A allows samus to move much more quickly, but it also[CR]allows for quick maneuvers to be performed.[CR]Try holding A in conjuction[CR]with other movements in order to find new and faster ways of getting[CR]around![CR]B: Jump[CR]X: Item Select (choose between items on the HUD, such as[CR]Missiles, Grappling beam, and more...)[CR]Y: Shoot[CR]L: Angle up/aim[CR]diagonally upwards[CR]R: Angle Down/aim diagonally downwards[CR]START:[CR]Pause[CR]SELECT: Item cancel (instantly deselect any chosen weapon on the[CR]HUD), auto-morph[CR]Controls can be modified to your personal liking in the[CR]CONTROLS menu before starting up the game.[CR]----------------------[CR]III.[CR]Exploring Planet Zebes[CR]Most of Hyper Metroid takes place on the vast,[CR]mysterious planet known as Zebes. Countless foes, new and old,[CR]reside[CR]within its depths. There are also many obstacles that will stand in[CR]Samus way. Some will require new abilities hidden all throughout[CR]the[CR]planet, but others will require ingenuity. Here are some tips and other things[CR]to look out for...[CR]Hold the RUN button: When you are holding run, you can[CR]quickly perform actions that can get you out of a[CR]tight spot! For example,[CR]hold RUN and then press JUMP. You will automatically summersault, even when[CR]youre a morphball![CR]Fighting with Ammo: Ammo is limited, but it is not[CR]without reason. Missiles are very powerful early on, and can eliminate[CR]most[CR]enemies in a single hit! Be sure to keep a keen eye for more ammo expansions.[CR]Being well stocked with ammo can get you out[CR]of even the tightest[CR]corners.[CR]Look out for small tunnels: These are all over the place. some[CR]tunnels are shortcuts, while others lead to secret new areas.[CR]Be sure to[CR]locate and explore any that you find, as there are rewards hidden all[CR]throughout...[CR]Be sure to visit Tourian: Tourian is the Pirates deep[CR]underground bunker. Its completely inaccessible to Samus, but there are[CR]clues[CR]there about how it may be entered. There is also a very valuable item[CR]hidden deep within that can turn the most dangerous[CR]battles in your[CR]favor...[CR]Look out for new beam weapons: Samuss Power Beam is very weak and[CR]ineffective. Its able to dispatch weaker enemies, but the ones[CR]found deeper[CR]in the planet can block it with their tough skin or armor. In order to remain[CR]on top, be sure to search high and low[CR]for new weapons. The most dedicated[CR]explorers who find as many beams as possible can come up with unstoppable new[CR]combinations.[CR]Try out bombs: Bombs are one of Samuss most valuable tools.[CR]Not only can they uncover hidden passageways, they can also pack[CR]a massive[CR]punch that one might not expect.[CR]Save your game often!: Save points are[CR]hidden all throughout the planet. These will allow you to try and retry parts[CR]that may give[CR]you trouble, so save often.[CR]Look at the map: There is[CR]always a new area to explore. Samuss power suit uses sonar to map out areas[CR]when she first steps foot[CR]in them. If youre ever feeling stuck, take a look[CR]at areas you have yet to go to on the map. Many areas are already shown,[CR]but[CR]hidden areas will often have hints or unexplored map squares that could[CR]be the puzzle peice you are missing.[CR]Dont feel obligated to defeat Gold[CR]Torizo: Youre probably not supposed to fight him[CR]yet.[CR]----------------------[CR]IV. Power Up![CR]Samuss Chozo-based power[CR]suit is highly adaptable. New powerups can immediately be installed for[CR]enhanced[CR]exploration abilities.[CR]Energy Tank: Energy Tanks add 100 to[CR]your maximum health. Collecting these will allow for[CR]sustained survival as[CR]you reach more dangerous depths of the planet.[CR]Reserve Tank: Reserve Tanks[CR]are like a second chance! If you run out of health, reserve tanks (if set to[CR]auto)[CR]will give you a moment to rethink your strategy while your health[CR]refills in a moment of desperation.[CR]Missile: Concussive ammo based rounds[CR]that pack a punch. Any missile pack will supply[CR]you with the missile[CR]launcher if you donat already have it. Packs add 5 ammo to your[CR]total.[CR]Super Missile: Explosive ammo based rounds that utterly destroy[CR]anything in their path.[CR]Super Missiles cost 10 ammo to fire. Any pack you[CR]find will supply you with the super missile launcher.[CR]Packs add 10 ammo to[CR]your total.[CR]Power Bomb: Unleash a devastating explosion and remove all[CR]opposition![CR]Power Bombs cost 20 ammo to light off. Any pack you find will[CR]supply you with power bombs.[CR]Packs add 15 ammo to your total.[CR]Grappling[CR]Beam: Use the grappling beam to make your way over dangerous or hindering[CR]obstacles[CR]all over the planet. You can swing back and forth to gain[CR]momentum, and you can latch on to walls[CR]to kick off of.[CR]Varia Suit:[CR]Varia suit adds 50% defense from damage, and also can protect samus from the[CR]most searing heat.[CR]Make sure to find this item![CR]Morph Ball: The[CR]morphball allows you to transform into a ball by pressing DOWN twice. Use this[CR]to access[CR]tunnels and other areas you couldnat enter previously.[CR]Bomb:[CR]Lethal energy based explosions that can destroy brittle or worn obstacles as[CR]well as any enemy youare[CR]skilled enough to hit with a bomb.[CR]High-Jump[CR]Boots: Enables an incredible jump height boost.[CR]Charge Beam: Charge up your[CR]beam for an almost unblockable shot that does triple damage![CR]An excellent[CR]back-up attack for if you run out of ammo.[CR]Wave Beam: +5 Damage[CR]Wave[CR]beam can pass through walls, putting any enemy within your reach.[CR]Wave beam[CR]is statistically the weakest beam, but has a hidden potential locked[CR]awaya|[CR]Ice Beam: +15 Damage[CR]Ice beam has the ability to stop your foes.[CR]You can then use them as platforms,[CR]or simply ignore them and move on to[CR]your next target.[CR]Spazer Beam: +20 Damage[CR]Spazer beam will triple the[CR]damage of added beams by changing one projectile into three![CR]Spazer is[CR]powerful by itself but can unlock incredible potential when combined with[CR]other beams.[CR]More power-ups can be found, but its up to you to find[CR]thema|[CR]Samus also has a wide variety of abilities ingrained into her power[CR]suit itself, but they[CR]must be discovered in order to fully use. Some[CR]require no items, while others require a combination[CR]of several.[CR]Special[CR]Beam Combos: With a certain ammo based weapon, you can charge up singular[CR]beams and[CR]execute powerful combos. Experiment and discover, for they could[CR]be very usefula|[CR]Crystal Flash: When youare at a point of desperation, you[CR]can use a power bomb and[CR]absorb it for a complete health refill. Be careful[CR]to watch your ammo, though! Crystal[CR]Flash is very expensive, and you may[CR]not have enough ammo so keep some stocked up if youare[CR]looking at a long[CR]and difficult fight. Press and hold L, R, shoot, and down, as a ball with[CR]powerbombs[CR]selected all at once to use this ability.[CR]Wall Jump: A secret[CR]ability that can make areas available earlier than they should be![CR]Keep[CR]your eye out for Eticoons, as they are known to be proficient in the[CR]skill.[CR]Shinespark: A powerful speed boost that can be utilized if you have[CR]a certain item.[CR]The Dachora knows how to do it, so pay close[CR]attentiona|[CR]Bomb Spread: Using Charge Beam and transforming into a ball[CR]while holding shoot will[CR]allow you to make a V-spread of bombs that can[CR]take out close by enemies.[CR]Samusas Power Suit is full of hidden[CR]abilities.[CR]Try out different things and you may [CR]find new ways to[CR]explore and fight![CR]----------------------[CR]V.

    <plot>HyperBound explores different ideas associated with video games such as non-[CR]linear narratives and spacial storytelling as it follows the trials and[CR]tribulations of an unnamed amnesiac who is thrust into a world that is[CR]completely unknown to him. HyperBound's core gameplay mechanic is the use of[CR]glitches as a metaphor for mental deterioration. One of the central trials of[CR]the game's story takes place inside the protagonist's mind. If you fail this[CR]challenge, then the game world crumbles in a video game way: garbage blocks[CR]muck up the screen, dialogue becomes scrambled, and some content even becomes[CR]inaccessible. Your choices, and the consequences of those choices, affects the[CR]game and the outcome of it. Don't miss out on this bizarre adventure from our[CR]one and only Hyperbound! :</plot>

They were kinda unnecessary and caused[CR]slowdown.[CR] * Changed the boss in World 5 to a giant Bony Beetle made with[CR]the n00b Boss template. Big Beetle was just too difficult, even to most Lets[CR]Players.[CR] * Changed the graphics used by KingPens breakable snowballs to[CR]differentiate them from the ones that dont break.[CR] * Eliminated the[CR]potential for graphical glitches at the end of A Miner Problem by changing the[CR]GFX bypass in SP4 so that it matches the settings of the previous sublevel.[CR]This was done because theres a carryable sprite by the exit pipe that connects[CR]the second and final parts of the level. Thanks to SSoHPKC for pointing out[CR]the glitch.[CR] * Made Kameks room a bit longer so that the boss is a little[CR]easier.[CR] * Added more obstacles to the first part of the Blue Switch Palace[CR]to make it a little more challenging.[CR] * Shortened a row of Turn Blocks in[CR]Brokeblock Mountain to make a somewhat annoying encounter with a pair of[CR]Hammer Bros. more manageable.[CR] * Made a minor edit to the graphics for the[CR]clouds that only sprites can stand on to make them more distinct from clouds[CR]that the player can stand on.[CR] * Added in some extra Switch Blocks to make[CR]finding the Switch Palaces have a greater impact on gameplay, ie some are used[CR]to lengthen platforms, close pits, and block a few Thwomps[CR] * Shortened the[CR]Tightrop/lengthened the ledge at the end of the second room in Kameks[CR]Castle[CR] * Added a Lightning Generator to Big Boo Theory[CR] * Edited the[CR]color mapping on the Spinies in Lord Lakis Castle[CR] * Removed one of the[CR]spiky columns in the second room of Lord Lakis Castle since it was too close[CR]to the end of a smash section and could glitch[CR] * Fixed the Chain Chomp so[CR]that its chain no longer glitches up in bsnes. Thanks to imamelia for pointing[CR]this glitch out, and thanks to SMWCentral for instructions on how to fix[CR]it.[CR] * Applied the SMA2 Powerdown patch[CR] * Made a couple minor edits in[CR]the second room of Totomesu IIs Fort[CR] * Removed a potential blind drop from[CR]Rolling Rock Road[CR] * Tweaked the Banzai Bill placement in Bullet Bluffs[CR]* Added 100 units to the timer in Hedgehog Heaven[CR] * Made the first room of[CR]the Green Switch Palace a little longer to add a bit of a challenge[CR] *[CR]Removed some Red Switch Blocks in Big Bonys Castle[CR] * Attempted to fix the[CR]Lakitu in Stormcloud Strut[CR] * Fixed minor bugs pointed out in the Removal[CR]Log[CR] * Made edits to Airship Assault so that Bullet Bros. no longer jump[CR]into the ground</plot>

    <plot>Mario and Luigi: Starlight Island Adventure is a total re-imagining of my[CR]n00bish 2006 hack, [Super Mario Starlight[CR]Remix](http://www.romhacking.net/hacks/1469/). This hack represents what that[CR]hack would have been like had it been created with the hacking skills and[CR]resources at my disposal in 2012. The hack features 44 levels spread across 8[CR]themed worlds. Difficulty is most comparable to Super Mario World for the most[CR]part.[CR]Read Me:[CR]Mario and Luigi: Starlight Island Adventure is a[CR]total reimagining of my 2006 hack, Super Mario Starlight Remix. It takes[CR]advantage of the hacking skills Ive obtained since creating that dinosaur of a[CR]hack, as well as many of the new resources available to SMW hackers, such as[CR]custom music, ASM hacks, and custom sprites. This hack has been tested in[CR]snes9x 1.53, so it should work in bsnes and ZSNES.[CR]In this hack, you can[CR]choose to play as either Mario or Luigi after loading your save file on the[CR]Title Screen. Each character handles differently. Mario plays like he always[CR]has, while Luigi has a higher standing jump and shoots straight[CR]fireballs.[CR]KNOWN ISSUES:[CR] * When leaving the Crystal Cavern submap,[CR]Mario/Luigis OW sprite will briefly appear just below Lemmys Castle. I dont[CR]know what causes this, and it doesnt affect gameplay.[CR] * The music will[CR]occasionally cut out on the OW. Patching the OW Music Disable Fix patch broke[CR]one of the custom blocks in the ROM when it was tested.[CR] * In Tidal Temples[CR]2, you can occasionally see a second trail of smoke several blocks above any[CR]Torpedo Ted that may be on the screen. This is a glitch in SMW that I havent[CR]been able to find a fix patch for.[CR] * Luigi is controlled with the second[CR]controller, even though hes meant to be an alternate Player 1 Character.[CR]Attempting to fix this with the hex edit provided in the ROM Map rendered the[CR]player unable to Spinjump, which wouldve made certain alternate paths[CR]inaccessible and therefore pointless.[CR] [CR] CHANGES SINCE REVISION 1[CR] *[CR]Fixed a couple errors on the OW.[CR] * Fixed some minor errors in Crystal[CR]Caverns 3.[CR] * Added Multi-Midway Patch and secondary checkpoints in all[CR]boss levels.[CR]CHANGES SINCE REVISION 2[CR] * Fixed some cutoff in 7-3 and[CR]7-4[CR] * Added safe platforms under the first instances of blue blocks/chains[CR]in Heavy Bs Fortress to allow players to learn the gimmick.[CR] * Removed the[CR]right wall and ceiling in Maxwells room since he could get stuck there,[CR]trapping the player in the level.[CR]CHANGES SINCE REVISION 3[CR] * Fixed some[CR]grapical glitches involving some of the decorative hills[CR] * Closed the[CR]opening on the left side of Bowsers room to prevent him from going off-screen[CR]and trapping the player[CR] * Fixed some cutoff on the OW[CR] [CR] CHANGES[CR]SINCE REVISION 4[CR] * Fixed bugs related to Morton, Roy, and Bowser (Thanks[CR]to imamelia)[CR] * Fixed the smoke image bug that shows up in Tidal Temple 2[CR](Thanks to MarioEdit)[CR] * Fixed some previously-unnoticed cutoff/graphical[CR]errors and made some other minor level tweaks</plot>

The menu now shows PSI again to give it[CR]consistency with Mother 1 and Mother 3.[CR]Also, all references made within[CR]the game to Mother 2 or Mother 3 are now all in caps (i.e. MOTHER 2 / MOTHER[CR]3).[CR] * PK MaternalBound Sigma v1.3.3:[CR]Some major text changes, fixed[CR]some more typos (thanks to Man Of Stars for the intensive feedback) and also[CR]fixed a bug found in the original EB game in which once you reach Milky Well[CR]and Rainy Circle, both of their melodies are swapped when you learn them, but[CR]if you play the Sound Stone they play normally.[CR]They now play like they[CR]should according to the Sound of Stone order when you first learn them.[CR] *[CR]PK MaternalBound Sigma v1.3.2.2:[CR]Magicant and Saturn Valley ATMs updated to[CR]an original sprite.[CR]This was done so that players can now tell that those[CR]objects are indeed ATMs and not just decoration.[CR]Also, some text and[CR]grammatical errors have been fixed.[CR]I wanted to wait until I could fix the[CR]prayer cutscene to show proper Night-time, but it is taking me a lot of time[CR]so far, so I decided to push a minimal update.[CR] * PK MaternalBound Sigma[CR]v1.3.2:[CR]Credits sequence edited![CR]Now the cast sequence finally shows[CR]Porky Minch and Runaway Bros. instead of the original ones![CR]Special thanks[CR]to both JeffMan and TragicManner for helping me outn on different aspects to[CR]achieve this milestone.[CR] * PK MaternalBound Sigma v1.3.1:[CR]Finally[CR]finished a whole playthrough testing all the text changes and sprites I have[CR]done.[CR]Everything seems in place and ready to go.[CR]I also fixed some kind[CR]of bug that CoilSnake dragged from the text dump of the script and some other[CR]text glitches here and there.[CR]Also, revamped some text that I felt still[CR]needed work. like linebreaks and stuff like that.[CR] * PK MaternalBound Sigma[CR]v1.3:[CR]Major update! Gas Station added, added music notes to certain text,[CR]Threeds Hidden NPCs restored, and Run Button and Mother 2 Title Screen[CR]optional patches included.[CR] * PK MaternalBound Gamma v1.2:[CR]Sprites,[CR]tiles and text are now complete!

Thanks to MightyYT[CR]for his hack which help make this possible.[CR] * Run Button - This allows you[CR]to press the Y button to run as if you were eating a Skip Sandwich.[CR]No more[CR]slow walking![CR]|||||||||Known Bugs/Glitches:[CR] *Mother 2 Title Screen[CR]Glitch:*[CR]This one is well-known and is carried over from MigthyYTs original[CR]TS hacks.[CR]If you press a button before the "demo" plays right after the[CR]Title Screen, the game will crash out on you, only a hard reset will help you[CR]here.[CR]Only way to avoid this is to wait for the game to completely finish[CR]the introduction sequence until you see the demo play (with Ness and friends[CR]walking around), only THEN you are safe to press any button to bring up the[CR]Save/Load screen.[CR]Starmen.net user H.S. found a way to implement a custom[CR]title screen without this glitch.[CR]Although, this was done at the cost of no[CR]animated title screen, meaning you will only get a static image when after the[CR]Gas Station screen. This is yet to be implemented.[CR] *Run Button[CR]Glitch:*[CR]When using Teleport Alpha and you bump into a building or any[CR]other collision location, the sprite for the burned Characters appear for a[CR]brief split second, then the sprite switches to that of the walking animation[CR]and stays in place. If someone can tell me how to fix it, Ill be[CR]grateful![CR]H.S. explained that this bug occurs due to the Run Button[CR]Patch.[CR]"The game uses the same byte to keep track of your party\92s[CR]\93state\94, which includes the running state, and the burnt state."[CR]That[CR]means that I will include the Run Button Patch as an optional patch to avoid[CR]this bug/glitch from the main hack. You are free to use it if you can overcome[CR]just that little hunka junk.</plot>

    <plot>Many years into the future, after the former heroes of the Mushroom Kingdom no[CR]longer exist; strange events begin to take place when the new antagonist:[CR]Nova, moves onto the island. A young boy by the name of Mute, has been[CR]recruited by the new princess of the Mushroom Kingdom to help fight for what's[CR]left of the land. But does he have what it takes to defeat Nova? Play the[CR]first episode of the action pack series, "Super Mute World." Important Note:[CR]For the best results, use ZSNES. There's a few problems that need to be fixed[CR]to make it compatible with BSNES, but it's perfectly compatible with[CR]ZSNES.[CR]Read Me:[CR]Here is the newest released version of Super Mario[CR]World "The After Years" and also the first installment to the Super Mute World[CR]Series. [CR](4 Episodes in total plus a few side series.) [CR]-This update[CR]includes-[CR]1. New and Revamped levels: Well there isnt actually any extra[CR]levels but some levels have been revamped completely to where they can be[CR]considered new. Some of the old levels are still there but a bit more updated.[CR]Some levels are a bit less linear and there are a some bonus areas added to[CR]the levels in such. [CR]2. New Overworld: While it may not be an over the top[CR]overworld, I still tried my hardest to make it. (No laziness or half effort.)[CR]Good effort should count for at least something. There are also a few event[CR]changes in such. There were a few dead end levels that were useless to play at[CR]first but every level that is a dead end now are somewhat important. (You no[CR]longer access the special world the same way anymore.) [CR]3. New and Updated[CR]Graphics: A few levels have graphics changed around in such. There are also a[CR]few levels that Ive edited the graphics myself in YYCHR, like Starlight[CR]Park.[CR]4. Bosses: A few boss fights were changed around and World 2 now has[CR]a different boss then before. Also redid the final boss fight. (The early[CR]version was kind of blah.) [CR]5. Cut scenes and Knock Back: Cut scenes are[CR]now able to be skipped and the knock back effect was decreased a lot. I[CR]couldnt get rid of it fully sadly but you should have more control of how far[CR]you get hit back. [CR]6. Soundtrack: A lot of tracks for the levels were[CR]changed around. I tried to go with more underused tracks or just tracks I like[CR]a lot. (Regardless of being overused.) [CR]- Special Credit List[CR]-[CR]TheHellWind84: (My Brother) - Mutes Graphics and part of Novas Graphics.[CR]Daizo Dee Von: World 2 Submap, World 8 Submap Graphics, Helped with Mutes[CR]Shading, and made the other part of Novas Graphics. Also some credit for[CR]originally helping with perspective errors in the first version.[CR]MaxodeX:[CR]Megaman X - Spark Mandrills Stage Port (Extermination Sites Track.) Megaman[CR]and Bass - Magic Mans Stage Port. (Starlight Tower and Secret Funzones Track.)[CR]Masterlink: Secret of Mana - The Holy Intruder (Prison Outbreak and[CR]Volcano Castles Track.) [CR]MarioStarLuigi: Final Fantasy 6 - Terra (World 3s[CR]Submap Track.) [CR]IceGuy: Ultimate Noob Boss. Well if it wasnt for this boss,[CR]I wouldnt have some bosses so Im thankful for that.[CR]cstutor89: Though he[CR]didnt beta test this version, he beta tested the first version and some of[CR]those levels are still in this version so credit is still due. [CR]Super Mario[CR]World Central: For making it happen![CR]If you have any questions concerning[CR]the hack please feel free to PM me.

    <plot>NEW! SMW2 Yoshi's Island is a more-than-full Yoshi's Island Hack. The story[CR]basically is the same like in the original game. Outline Data * 60 brand-new,[CR]difficult levels * Custom level icons * Custom level maps * Added Yoshi colors[CR]for Extra- and Secret levels[CR]Read Me:[CR]NEW! SMW2 Yoshis Island - by[CR]Yoshis Fan[CR]1. History and Info[CR]2. The Tools I Used[CR]3. FAQ[CR]4.[CR]Thanks To...[CR]5.[CR]Contact[CR]========================================================================================[CR]1.[CR]History and Info[CR]NEW! Yoshis Island is a hacked version of Super Mario[CR]World 2: Yoshis Island.[CR]I hacked this game, because I think its just a[CR]great game and because of the [CR]possibility to make my own levels. I tried[CR]to hack this game earlier, that was[CR]in 2008 or so, but I didnt get on with[CR]the editor of the game, so after 1 day[CR]I gave it up. Then, in summer 2009,[CR]I dont know exactly what it was, but then I[CR]gave it a try again and found[CR]SMWC. There I got the info I needed to hack Yoshis[CR]Island in a proper way.[CR]Since then, I tried to improve the editors quality, mainly[CR]by correcting[CR]major mistakes with its DAT-files. Ive worked with EggVine till the[CR]hacks[CR]completion, since Golden Egg was still a beta and I didnt want to risk[CR]anything.[CR]To play this hack you need Version 1.0 of the games American[CR]version. [CR]I cant give you the ROM with my hacked version of the game,[CR]because that [CR]is illegal. I also may not give you a download-link. Its[CR]name, when you downloaded[CR]the file, should be something like this: Super[CR]Mario World 2: Yoshis Island (U) (1.0).smc[CR]Then you have to patch the IPS-[CR]file to the game. But[CR]watch out!! It must be verion 1.0 of the American[CR]version and it must have a header,[CR]so its file size is 2.097.664 Bytes.[CR]Others wont work.[CR]In the worst case, your ROM is corrupted after[CR]patching.[CR]Ive started working on the hack the day I registered at[CR]SMWCentral, 2009-07-11[CR]The final release of the hack I published on[CR]2012-12-31, however, this is provisional,[CR]meaning that there might be[CR]updates, fixes, etc. if necessary.[CR]The CRC-32 checksum of the patched game[CR]is: [46 21 C7 59][CR]You can most likely view the checksum in your Emulator by[CR]clicking ROM-[CR]Info.[CR]=========================================================================================[CR]2.[CR]The Tools I Used[CR]EggVine 0.81+ (Yoshis Island Level Editor; the + is for[CR]the improved DAT-files, which[CR] helped me quite a lot)[CR]Translhextion (Hex[CR]Editor, mainly for text editing and byte expansion)[CR]YCompress (De- and[CR]Recompressor program for graphics)[CR]YY-CHR (Graphic-Editor I used)[CR]Xkas[CR](Tool to patch files to the ROM, that alter its workings)[CR]Some IPS files[CR](Files to alter the games inner workings)[CR]SNESPal (Palette editor for SNES[CR]games)[CR]SNESTool (Tool for creating IPS patches and more)[CR]IPSandSum (Tool[CR]for correcting the CRC-32 checksum)[CR]My Brain (Since it knows how to hack[CR]this game, this one is[CR]essential!)[CR]=========================================================================================[CR]3.[CR]FAQ[CR]Q: How can I play the game? There is only an IPS file.[CR]A: Download[CR]the original Yoshis Island (1.0) (U) ROM and LunarIPS.[CR] Afterwards run[CR]LunarIPS. The rest is self-explanatory. You also[CR] need an SNES Emulator to[CR]play it.[CR]Q: Why dont you provide the ROM?[CR]A: Its illegal. The IPS patch[CR]only contains the changes made to the ROM,[CR] so no copyright infringement by[CR]providing it.[CR]Q: What Emulators can I play this on?[CR]A: Technically it[CR]should work just fine with any SNES Emulator.[CR] The hack was tested by me[CR]with Snes9X. Dont know what the others used.[CR]Q: How long is this[CR]hack?[CR]A: Its longer than the original game, which had 54 levels.[CR] This[CR]hack contains 60 levels.[CR]Q: How difficult is this hack?[CR]A: Its harder[CR]than the original game. Throughout the game, the levels[CR] become harder and[CR]harder to beat. The difficulty might be kind of[CR] unbalanced. The most[CR]difficult level is Secret 6, definitely.[CR]Q: Did you make this hack[CR]alone?[CR]A: Of course not (see 4. Thanks To...), but the levels are[CR]completely by me.[CR]Q: Why the **** did it take you so long to finish[CR]this?[CR]A: People got things they need to take care of in RL. Nothing more to[CR]say here.[CR]Q: Are there known bugs or glitches?[CR]A: I fixed every single[CR]found bug and glitch, so there are no known issues,[CR] which doesnt mean I[CR]warrant it being free from bugs and glitches.[CR]Q: Is there any kind of a[CR]sample solution?[CR]A: No, but if you cant find something you can either[CR]contact me @ SMWCentral or[CR] search on YouTube and the likes.[CR]Q: Is it[CR]necessary to know the original game to play this?[CR]A: No, its not necessary,[CR]but I recommend you to have played it before in order[CR] to know whats going[CR]on. Its definitely a great game plus you can practice[CR] for the levels in my[CR]hack, which are harder than the original[CR]levels.[CR]=========================================================================================[CR]4.[CR]Thanks To...[CR]Of course I didnt make this hack completely alone, since I had[CR]some helping hands![CR]Squash Monster (Programmer of EggVine)[CR]SMWC[CR]community (Many valuable info I needed, Testing, Motivation and Bug[CR]Reports)[CR]Jeorge535 (Beta-Testing the levels)[CR]Zeldara109 (Finding Bugs[CR]and Glitches)[CR]Ripperon-X (13 Level Icons)[CR]tehaxor69 (ASM-related[CR]stuff)[CR]Mattrizzle (ASM-related stuff, some elements for Level[CR]Icons)[CR]Kipernal (ASM-related stuff)[CR]Romi (ASM-related stuff)[CR]Lespna1[CR](Ideas for a few Level Icons)[CR]Nintendo (Creating this amazing game)[CR]My[CR]apologies go to Mattrizzle for deliberately taking three elements[CR]of his[CR]level icons without asking (then hes allowed me to use them,[CR]though).[CR]=========================================================================================[CR]5.[CR]Contact[CR]I wont give you my E-Mail, but you can contact me @ SMWCentral[CR]everytime you want.[CR]In case you are registered at SMWCentral, you can use[CR]this direct URL to send me a[CR]message:[CR]http://www.SMWCentral.net/?p=pm&amp;do;=compose&amp;user;=6562[CR]=========================================================================================</plot>

NOTE - May have issues in SNES9x, worked fine on[CR]ZSNES. The sequel to my other hack; Super "Mario" World VERSION 1.4 FINAL FIX[CR]This hack is much longer and has a lot more custom stuff in than the first. It[CR]also uses my own GFX style. If you enjoyed S"M"W1 you'll enjoy this for[CR]sure![CR]Read Me:[CR]Super "Mario" World 2 By 1UPDUDES[CR]-Version 1.4[CR]Fix[CR]This hack is the sequel to my other hack (Super "Mario" World) &gt;[CR]The[CR]hack is about 90 levels long roughly, and features a whole new GFX[CR]style[CR]unlike the first hack which still used orignal SMW resources.[CR]With[CR]10 worlds to play and plenty of secrets to find I hope you enjoy[CR]playing[CR]the hack. This read me also includes some things such as minor bugs[CR]and a few[CR]other things.[CR]Little side not, not that it is important byt[CR]the GFX are not to be used in other[CR]hacks. Its what makes my hack "special"[CR]to some degree... ;3[CR]Enough reading, get playing ^.^[CR]1UPDUDES[CR]2012[CR]---------------[CR]Credits are located in at the end of World 10.[CR]Which I must thank a lot of[CR]people so if you were not included Im sorry[CR];__; Just drop me a PM on SMWC[CR]if you have any questions or[CR]whatnot.[CR]Minor Bugs:[CR]- Any orignally in SMW that are still there in many[CR]other hacks[CR]- Level Tiles B, 1C and 128 are already present on the OW[CR]without any event triggers[CR]due to a glitch where there events where not[CR]making them appear and messing[CR]up other levels events.[CR]- World 5s boss[CR]has a hit counter, which has a slightly bad pallette[CR]- World 6s mid-bosses[CR]BG doesnt fade away at end of level[CR]( creates a cool looking zoom out[CR]effect o_o )[CR]- World 8s final boss can go offscreen in the scrolling[CR]section however[CR]if you reach the end of that section without it the level[CR]still works just it[CR]may not make much sense[CR]- In World 10s "When Worlds[CR]Collide Level" the New Age Retro Hippie section[CR]requires all sprites off[CR]screen. If you have Goshi just dump him in the pit to[CR]continue. (This[CR]should be clear for common hack players/moderators)[CR]- In World 10s boss on[CR]the last section when SPOILER-[CR]the bosses "fist" hits the ground after been[CR]hit twice will make tremours which[CR]makes you be able to fall through the[CR]platform. This is actually something I[CR]wanted to happen and makes the fight[CR]a tad bit trickier[CR]All these bugs are really minor and wont really effect[CR]or damage gameplay to[CR]any degree really. I just stated them anyway just in[CR]case people where [CR]curious to why stuff happens.</plot>

    <plot>This hack is worth playing simply due to its originality! Be warned however[CR]that some may find its content offensive. If you are not easily offended, it[CR]is hilarious with its use of violent imagery, such as the numerous squirming,[CR]bleeding Toads impaled on stakes in a graveyard as shown in the screenshots,[CR]not to mention that Morton's Jail has to be the single most disturbing level[CR]ever created for a Mario game! There are also many drug references, a hidden[CR]evil Kirby world, and if you can find it, an Adults Only Palace of Hentai.[CR]This hack is very fun and is about the same level of difficulty as the[CR]original. It features awesome graphics rips, music and overall feel from Super[CR]Mario Bros 3, custom blocks, overworld and sprites. Even the credits have[CR]something interesting and unexpected in them! So, if you don't have a problem[CR]with some morbid humor and twisted creativity, this is the game for you.[CR]Enjoy.</plot>

    <plot>One day a mysterious black pipe suddenly appeared in the Mushroom Kingdom, in[CR]front of the Toadstool Castle. Mario decided to explore inside it, and he was[CR]teleported to an unknown island called Full Moon Island. Little did he know[CR]that there wasn't any way back... apparently.

Its not very long (32 levels excluding[CR]houses and bonus levels), I tried to make every level unique, with few puzzles[CR]here and there and lots of platforming. Please, send me a PM if you find a[CR]bug, and Ill try to fix it.[CR]The first version of this hack was released the[CR]8th May 2011. The v1.2 was released the 15th October 2011, and its fully[CR]compatible with every emulator to date (up to BSNES v082)*.[CR]* Its suggested[CR]to play it with ZSNES. With Snes9X and BSNES there may be some sprite[CR]flickering (mostly in busiest levels such as Azure Peak, Eternal Forest,[CR]Munchers Vengeance, Eternal Castle, Ol Rusty Boat and specially Eternal Rain).[CR]If you want the best compatibility you may want to play the v1.0, without HDMA[CR]and other effects. Both version are fully playable anyway.[CR]- How to play[CR]-[CR] This is a Super Mario World hack. You need the rom of the original game,[CR]an emulator (such as ZSNES, Snes9X or BSNES) and Lunar IPS. [CR] Open the[CR]patch "Quest on Full Moon Island v1.2.ips" with Lunar IPS and apply it to[CR]Super Mario World, then play it with your favourite emulator.[CR] Everything[CR]you need (apart from the rom, use Google to find it) can be found in the Tools[CR]section of SMW Central: [CR]http://www.smwcentral.net/?p=list&amp;type;=tools[CR]- Storyline -[CR] One day a[CR]mysterious black pipe suddenly appeared in the Mushroom Kingdom, in front of[CR]the Toadstool Castle. [CR] Mario decided to explore inside it, and he was[CR]teleported to an unknown island called Full Moon Island. [CR] Little did he[CR]know that there wasnt any way back... apparently. [CR] Other people were[CR]trapped there as well, so he began to roam around in search of an escape.[CR]-[CR]Changelog for v1.2 -[CR] - Fixed a sprite memory issue.[CR] - Fixed a[CR]grammatical error.[CR] - Removed silent Bullet Bills.[CR] - Overworld updated[CR](thanks to Firoshi).[CR] - Various little updates to some levels.[CR] -[CR]Slighty changed the introduction to the final boss to prevent a possible[CR]bug.[CR]- Changelog for v1.1 -[CR] - Added various HDMA effects.[CR] - Most of[CR]the levels have entirely remade backgrounds.[CR] - Removed the annoying noise[CR]when jumping in a level with samples (thanks to Red&amp;Green;).[CR] - Added a[CR]logo in the title screen.[CR] - Fixed some minor palette errors.[CR] - Some[CR]musics are slighty improved.[CR] - Fixed some priority errors.[CR] - Various[CR]updates to older levels.[CR]- Trivia -[CR] - Two levels in the third world[CR]were made by guest level designers: Cloudy Woods by Red&amp;Green; and Windy[CR]Heights by ZtE.[CR] - There wasnt any real plot until a week before the[CR]release.[CR] - The final boss theme is from Monstania, an RPG released only in[CR]Japan. I made a rearrangement of it, that you can find here:[CR]http://bin.smwcentral.net/48067/Black%20Curtain%20%28rearranged%29.mp3[CR] -[CR]Theres a hidden house level in the first Eternal Dimension world.

    <plot>This is THE most descriptive, shocking, and most psychologically warping game[CR]you will ever play. You're a bounty hunter who is given the duty to track down[CR]a mysterious creature who mutilated and ate a little girl's parents and[CR]encounters various horrible things as the adventure goes on. This game isn't[CR]your average Halloween game; its content is comparable to games like Silent[CR]Hill and Yume Nikki. This game also has the added effect of making you[CR]depressed as you played. Counting real games and fan games, this could be one[CR]of the most traumatic and horrifying games in the world, and we're not joking.[CR]This is easily one of the most disturbing hacks to come out...well, ever,[CR]really. Note: Toby Fox is kinda ashamed of this hack as some stuff in this[CR]hack has not aged well, like the final boss swearing that he will " shove your[CR]asses so far down your throats that when you crap you'll sing fucking[CR]Beethoven. tl: eat shit faggots". Yeah, it's pretty much extremely offensive[CR]now compared to his newer creations like Undertale. It is also kinda[CR]difficult, so to be sure, be sure to use save states. Flowey would be proud.[CR]This is also the first appearance of Toby Fox's signature song, MEGALOVANIA.[CR]So before Sans dunked on you, a familiar character from the original game will[CR]dunk on you. I'm not telling who it is, just that it is a big surprise. THIS[CR]HACK CONTAINS MATURE CONTENT. IF YOU ARE OFFENDED BY NAUGHTY LANGUAGE AND[CR]ADULT THEMES THEN DO NOT PLAY THIS HACK.</plot>

    <plot>The only complete Yoshi's Island hack in the world. This contains 54 brand new[CR]levels, so have fun.[CR]Read Me:[CR]SMW2+ by Golden Yoshi[CR]I. Hack[CR]Info[CR]II. Timeline[CR]III. Known Bugs/Things That Seem Like Bugs But[CR]Arent[CR]IV. Thank Yous[CR]V. Tools Used[CR]VI.[CR]Contact[CR]-----------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]I.[CR]Hack Info[CR]SMW2+ is a hack of Super Mario World 2: Yoshis Island. I decided[CR]to [CR]make a hack of this game because Yoshis Island is one of my[CR]favorite[CR]games of all time. I started hacking YI in August 2004, when I[CR]became[CR]a beta tester for Squash Monsters editor EggVine. Since then, I[CR]have[CR]released 4 demos of my hack, and now this hack is finally[CR]complete![CR]To play this hack, patch the enclosed ips file to a fresh Yoshis[CR]Island ROM, but you must note, you must use Yoshis Island[CR]v1.0(U).smc.[CR]Other versions of the ROM will not, I repeat, will not[CR]work.[CR]-----------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]II.[CR]Timeline[CR]August 5, 2004: I started hacking YI.[CR]August 9, 2004: SMW2+[CR]project started.[CR]August 15, 2004: Demo 1 released (1-1 through[CR]1-4)[CR]September 3, 2004: Demo 2 released (1-1 through Extra 1)[CR]December[CR]11, 2004: Demo 3 released (1-1 through Extra 2)[CR]May 30, 2005: Demo 4[CR]released (1-1 through Extra 3)[CR]August 22, 2005: Full version[CR]released![CR]-----------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]III.[CR]Known Bugs[CR]1. In the cave part in 1-5, you may fall through the moving[CR]platforms [CR]if you stay in that room too long.[CR]2. Yoshi turns green when[CR]he touches the phantoms in 2-2.[CR]3. The first two red coins in the platform[CR]ghost portion of 1-8 will[CR]not appear if you get the 2 red coins by the[CR]flower in the first part[CR]of this level.[CR]4. In the dark portion of 2-8,[CR]when you come out of the pipes on the [CR]right hand side, Yoshi will quickly[CR]appear beneath the stone ground.[CR]5. The first pirahna plant in 3-3 doesnt[CR]spring up unless you get [CR]really close to it.[CR]6. Sometimes enemies will[CR]appear when approached from one direction[CR]and disappear when approached[CR]from a different direction. If this [CR]happens with important items, such as[CR]red coins and flowers other than[CR]the ones listed above, or any enemies[CR]necessary for special puzzles or[CR]purposes, let me know. [CR]Things that[CR]seem like bugs but arent[CR]1. In 1-7, fat shyguys will cease to appear if you[CR]carry more than 2 [CR]giant eggs. This also occurred in the original YI.[CR]2.[CR]At the bottom of the trees in 2-3, there is a little bit of bright[CR]green on[CR]the grass that may look strange. This was also done in Secret [CR]1 of the GBA[CR]version of YI.[CR]3. In a certain part of 2-3, the pokey ball enemy stays on[CR]top of the[CR]line guide. This may seem weird, but it was also done in Secret[CR]1 of[CR]the GBA version.[CR]4. There is an error with ZSNES. Typically when[CR]you enter a new room,[CR]the screen will start out black and all the other[CR]layers will appear.[CR]However, in some parts there is an emulator bug that[CR]causes layer 2[CR]to appear first instead of the black screen, followed by the[CR]remaining[CR]layers. This occurs in rooms with fuzzies and pseudo-3D rocks.[CR]Also,[CR]in rooms with pseudo-3D rocks, the moving rocks may flash weird[CR]reflections of themselves. You can disable these ZSNES bugs by[CR]disabling the new gfx engine by pressing 8. However, disabling the[CR]engine will cause other problems, such as a thin line of BG on [CR]the[CR]level name screens, so you pick what youd rather have.[CR]5. In some levels,[CR]the pirhana plants flash a brownish color when hit rather[CR]than the usual[CR]light blue. Some levels in the original, such as 4-7[CR]and 5-6, have the same[CR]color. This is because you need to use a [CR]certain palette for other[CR]enemies.[CR]6. 4-1 is named "Welcome To Paradice". I know I misspelled[CR]Paradise,[CR]theres a reason, Ill let you figure this one out ;).[CR]Feel free[CR]to report any bugs not listed[CR]above.[CR]-----------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]IV.[CR]Thank Yous[CR]Squash Monster: developing EggVine, helping me work out many[CR]problems[CR]with my hack, and support[CR]cpubasic13: beta testing, help with[CR]hex editing, and support[CR]Aioria: beta testing[CR]Koroc: beta[CR]testing[CR]Sonicandtails111: beta testing and support[CR]Peardian: whaddya[CR]know? beta testing, and support[CR]Keikonium: cant quite remember...oh yes,[CR]now I do!

    <plot>Story: The stork was peacefully on his way to deliver future heroes Baby Mario[CR]and Luigi to their parents, when all of a sudden, Kamek appeared in the skies.[CR]He quickly attempted to snatch the babies from the stork, only managing take[CR]Baby Luigi, while Baby Mario fell to the ocean. Luckily, he lands on Yoshi's[CR]Island. The Yoshies gather and ponder how to remedy the situation. The Yoshies[CR]decide to carry along Baby Mario, and call upon the Chosen One to face Kamek.[CR]The Yoshies don't know the exact identity of the Chosen One, but know that he[CR]always watches over and protects the Yoshies, and has an immense amount of[CR]power. Why has Kamek kidnapped these babies? And just who is this mysterious[CR]Chosen One? You will find out when you play! What this hack features... * 50[CR]all-new levels of classic Yoshi's Island design! Journey through 5 worlds to[CR]reunite Baby Mario with Baby Luigi. * Now unlock an Extra and a Secret level[CR]by scoring 100% on each world! * Enhanced Yoshi colors!

For those who have played SMW2+, the approach[CR]is [CR]pretty much the same: same core gameplay as the original Yoshis Island,[CR]but with brand new[CR]levels. Here are some of the features you can expect in[CR]the hack:[CR] * 50 all-new levels of classic Yoshis Island design! Journey[CR]through 5 worlds to reunite [CR] Baby Mario with Baby Luigi.[CR] * Now unlock[CR]an Extra and a Secret level by scoring 100% on each world![CR] * Enhanced[CR]Yoshi colors!

You will [CR]find out when you[CR]play![CR]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]How[CR]to[CR]play[CR]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]You[CR]will need a few things to play this hack. One is an SNES emulator to[CR]physically play the[CR]hack. I recommend using ZSNES or SNES9x. This zip file[CR]came enclosed with an .ips patch. You will [CR]need to patch it to version 1.0[CR](U) of the Yoshis Island ROM. Patching it to different [CR]versions will not[CR]work. The most common errors that occur when you patch it to the[CR]wrong[CR]version are that the message box border on the introduction scene is[CR]glitched, and it will[CR]then freeze at the "Welcome To Yoshis Island" screen.[CR]If this happens, you know you patched[CR]it to the wrong version of the ROM,[CR]so you must redownload. You will also need a patching tool to [CR]actually[CR]patch the .ips to the ROM. I recommend LunarIPS or SNESTool. Once you patch[CR]the .ips [CR]to the ROM, then youre good to go. Just load it up in your[CR]emulator.[CR]-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Timeline[CR]-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]February[CR]27, 2007- SMW2+2 started[CR]March 22, 2007- World 1 Demo released[CR]May 24,[CR]2007- World 2 Demo released[CR]April 17, 2008- Full Version[CR]released[CR]-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Special[CR]Thanks[CR]-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Mattrizzle-[CR]endless help with offsets, custom graphics[CR]S.N.N.- testing, support,[CR]posting information on my behalf, Secret level icons[CR]fabio- testing,[CR]support[CR]Squash Monster- creating the Yoshis Island editor, EggVine[CR]MiOr-[CR]help with offsets,[CR]testing[CR]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Tools[CR]Used[CR]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]EggVine[CR]Translhextion[CR]Hex[CR]Editor XVI32[CR]Tile Layer Pro[CR]LunarIPS[CR]ZSNES[CR]ycompress</plot>

    <plot>This is the Super Mario World hack made by the man who made Super Mario World[CR]hacking easy with Lunar Magic, FuSoYa! What started out as just a demo of what[CR]Lunar Magic could do, it turned into a full hack of Super Mario World that's[CR]complete right to the end. This patch is so expansive it expands the size of[CR]the ROM to 48mbits! It showcases many of the features in Lunar Magic,[CR]including the new tile and palette animation feature included in version 1.60.[CR]And it has new custom blocks such as screen-scrolling type pipes that are[CR]similar to what you'd see in Mario 3. This truly a great hack! It must be[CR]played and experienced to be judged! It's also very challenging! So, what are[CR]you waiting for? Quit reading this and go download and play the patch! NOTE:[CR]This patch is made for a 48mbit expanded version of Super Mario World. Please[CR]use LunarExpand to expand you Super Mario world ROM before applying this patch[CR]as explained in the readme![CR]Read[CR]Me:[CR]______________________________________________________________________[CR]Demo World : The Legend Continues (SNES)[CR] October 31, 2003[CR] Version[CR]1.10[CR] FuSoYas Niche[CR] http://fusoya.cg-[CR]games.net[CR]______________________________________________________________________[CR]CONTENTS[CR]______________________________________________________________________[CR]1. Introduction[CR] 2. Instructions (Read before you patch!)[CR] 3.[CR]Updates[CR] 4. Legal Notice[CR] 5. Contact[CR]Information[CR]______________________________________________________________________[CR]1.[CR]Introduction[CR]______________________________________________________________________[CR]Demo World is a hack to demonstrate how well Lunar Magic can modify[CR] Super[CR]Mario World. There are 3 major versions of Demo World that[CR] have been[CR]released to date.[CR] The first version of Demo World was released on[CR]September 10, 2001.[CR] While it only contained a few short levels, its[CR]primary purpose was[CR] to serve as an example for how to do custom block ASM.[CR]To this end,[CR] it was the first hack to implement the animated "breakable[CR]brick"[CR] from Mario 3. The brick could be broken only when Mario hit it[CR]from[CR] below when big or from the side with a cape. It would also turn[CR]into[CR] a coin when a POW was hit. There were a few other custom blocks[CR]as[CR] well, such as a block that would break only when Mario hit it with[CR]a[CR] fireball, and a Mario 3 style frozen coin.[CR] A second unofficial[CR]version of Demo World was later released by[CR] Bouche, called "Demo World 3".[CR]It was identical to Demo World other[CR] than the music, which was replaced[CR]with Mario 3 tunes.[CR] The third version of Demo World was released on[CR]September 21, 2003.[CR] Called "Demo World : The Legend Continues" (DWTLC),[CR]its a full hack[CR] of Mario World thats complete right to the end. It[CR]showcases many[CR] of the features in Lunar Magic, including the new tile and[CR]palette[CR] animation feature included in version 1.60. And as with the[CR]original[CR] Demo World, it has new custom blocks such as screen-scrolling[CR]type[CR] pipes that are similar to what youd see in Mario 3. A version 1.1[CR]update was released about a month later to fix a few bugs.[CR] DWTLC was done[CR]by both myself (FuSoYa) and Zero-G (my brother).[CR] Although we had long[CR]planned to make a complete hack of Demo World,[CR] towards the end of last[CR]year we had only gotten the first 2 worlds[CR] of it done. It then remained[CR]inactive for about half a year, until[CR] we finally set a deadline for[CR]ourselves of getting the hack out[CR] there, ready or not, before the next[CR]version of Lunar Magic was [CR] released near the end of September. What[CR]followed was a frantic[CR] two months of level creation and coding, the result[CR]of which is this[CR] hack.[CR] We were both a little surprised by how well it[CR]turned out, given the[CR] time limit. Im very grateful to Zero-G, who deserves[CR]most of the[CR] credit for the levels, as he made about 4/5 of them.[CR]Anyway, have fun playing DWTLC![CR]^^[CR]______________________________________________________________________[CR]2.[CR]Instructions[CR]______________________________________________________________________[CR]First off, DO NOT patch the original ROM with the included IPS file![CR] The[CR]reason is that I used DWTLC to test LM with ROMs greater than [CR] 4 MB. But[CR]since this involves moving the banks around, an IPS file[CR] for the hack[CR]would include most of the original ROM in it. To avoid[CR] the issue, Ive[CR]included a patch meant to be applied to a ROM that[CR] has already been[CR]expanded to 6 MB.[CR] Thus, you should take the original Mario World US ROM[CR]and use Lunar[CR] Expand (included in this zip file for convenience) to[CR]convert the[CR] ROM to a 48 Mbit ExHiROM (its the top right option in the[CR]program).[CR] THEN apply the IPS file to it.[CR] And thats all there is to it![CR]^^[CR]______________________________________________________________________[CR]3.[CR]Updates[CR]______________________________________________________________________[CR]Version[CR]1.10 October 31, 2003[CR]-fixed SRAM saving and loading for Snes9x 1.40+.[CR]Should also fix it [CR] for copiers.[CR]-several minor adjustments to the[CR]screen scrolling pipe ASM to fix a[CR] few issues. The changes were[CR]significant enough to force us to redo[CR] the title screen demo[CR]sequence.[CR]-modified Secret Star World level so that you cant just use Yoshi[CR]to[CR] get to the keyhole.[CR]-removed useless key from Ship Graveyard.[CR](VortexMilitia)[CR]-fixed an entrance BG init position in #3 Water Castle.[CR](Proto K)[CR]-adjusted a few water levels to prevent swimming in dirt.[CR](Maticolotto)[CR]-fixed another BG init bug with a MagiKoopa level.[CR](Sendy)[CR]-a few other relatively minor changes and fixes here and[CR]there.[CR]Version 1.00 September 21, 2003[CR]-First[CR]Release.[CR]______________________________________________________________________[CR]4.

    <plot>This hack of Super Mario World is an idea of making a sequel to the original[CR]Mario World in a way of BIGGER, LONGER; HARDER AND COOLER. We worked over 2[CR]years on it. It is mostly vanilla - it has a lot of custom palettes, lots of[CR]MAP16 use of original graphics, 2 custom blocks (star-break- block / No Yoshi-[CR]block) and over 100 exits. It is very puzzlingly and challenging, but still[CR]has a very relaxing difficulty in the first worlds. The Lunatic world is[CR]extremely challenging. We hope you all enjoy this hack as much as we did[CR]making and playing it, too! A complete walk-through (Let's Play) you can find[CR]here at Ninjaboys channel:  A GERMAN walk-through with the final version of[CR]the hack you can find here at Dusselchens channel:  Length: 106 exit(s) Don't[CR]forget to apply a header to the ROM before patching it!</plot>

    <plot>This is a hack with SMB,SMB3,SMB2,YI and a few SML styled levels. Graphics and[CR]music changes have also been made to this hack as well. Story:Bowser and the[CR]Koopa Kids Invaded South Mushroom Kingdom. Mario must stop them before it's[CR]too late. NOTE:USE ZSNESW 1.51 if possible. Updates: * Ghost House Time +100.[CR]* Fixed Iggy's Castle Name to Larry's Castle and vice versa. * Bowser's Fire[CR]Breath SFX[CR]Read Me:[CR]SUPER MARIO BROS. 3 X [CR]This is the final[CR]version of my hack. You can play it until World 9.[CR]Note: The best emulator[CR]compatible with this hack is ZSNESW 1.51.[CR]I dont know about other version[CR]since its the only one i used.[CR]SNES9X is incompatible with this.[CR]Another[CR]note: Now it works on Snes9x, as well in BSNES.[CR]Story:Bowser and the Koopa[CR]Kids Invaded seven islands and their [CR]next target is Mushroom Kingdom.[CR]Mario must stop [CR]them before its too late.[CR]Note for some people who[CR]request to base their hacks from SMB3X:[CR]1. Im not allowing people to base[CR]their hacks on this hack anymore.[CR] Because even if i allow people to base[CR]from my hack, its useless because[CR] of some asm hacks already installed[CR]there like the Pause from the status[CR] bar.Even if you use a status bar[CR]editor, it will return to SMB3X letters[CR] when unpaused .Another thing is i[CR]used a lot of custom sprites and blocks[CR] and i also used custom music so[CR]there wont be any large freespace.[CR]2.Do not rip FG graphics from SMB3X that[CR]was originally made by me. You can[CR] use the some of my other graphics as[CR]long as you have my permission.Just PM me.[CR]Credits:[CR]Graphics -[CR]Pac(Graphics Hack),andy_k_250(SML sprites),Mirumo.[CR]Custom Blocks - Smkdan[CR](BTSD).Mikeyk (SMB3 Pipes),ICB(SMB2 Blocks)[CR]Custom Sprites[CR]-Smwedit,Smkdan,Romi,Mirumo,Davros,Carol,Magus[CR]Custom Music -[CR]MidiGuy,Supertails,Carol,Jimmy52905,SNN[CR]Lunar Magic - Fusoya[CR]And to some[CR]other people in SMWCentral.[CR]ENJOY.</plot>

    <plot>Super Mario Kart makes its comeback! This hack is a complete remake of SMK,[CR]featuring 20 new tracks. The AI also works, meaning you'll have to work for[CR]that first place in GP mode. For when you're feeling more like hitting your[CR]friends with shells and bananas, there's also 4 new battle mode courses for[CR]you and your friends to determine who is the champion of battle once and for[CR]all. If you played the original SMK and felt that you needed more of a[CR]challenge or wanted more to experience, then download this hack. You won't be[CR]disappointed. Patch onto a headerless Super Mario Kart (U) ROM and[CR]enjoy.[CR]Read Me:[CR]This hack was made by karterfreak from[CR]Romhacking.net[CR]I would like to thank the following people:[CR]-[CR]Puresabe[CR]For creating MAKE.[CR]- Dirtbag[CR]For showing me MAKE and working[CR]with me on various small things, and being an overall help in the creation of[CR]this hack. Good luck with your Super Baldy Kart hack![CR]- SMKDan[CR]For his[CR]very useful MK Items editor, which made removal of the feather and more[CR]balanced items easier (I think the feather is awesome too people, but it makes[CR]some of the courses pretty broken, Im trying to avoid this)[CR]- ???[CR]Unsure[CR]of the name of this person, but this person created the speedometer used in[CR]this hack. Patch name was speedo_v9.13 (U). It was a great feature to add to[CR]the hack. Sorry I dont know your name.[CR]- Romhacking.net[CR]For support and[CR]motivation in completing the hack. Also for the continuing development in SMK[CR]hacking. I wish good luck to all the people who are working on that now and in[CR]the future.[CR]- The Players Page (www.mariokart64.com/smk)[CR]The people I[CR]made this hack for. Without them, this hack would have never come to be. I[CR]highly suggest anyone and everyone who is interested in time trials for super[CR]mario kart to compete here, you wont find a better place.</plot>

    <plot>This is a ROM hack of Super Mario RPG that shows off what you can do with the[CR]statistical and gameplay (battle system-wise) aspects of the game mostly, but[CR]also shows what you can do in terms of attack animations and other things as[CR]well. V5.0 - ABSOLUTE Release. Fixes ALL bugs that existed in previous[CR]versions, including the bugs where the battle message doesn't pop up for[CR]specials after Level 30. They will NEVER pop up now. Fixed the Lamb's Lure not[CR]working properly and not allowing you to obtain a certain later item.[CR]Thunderbolt (Mg. Power 32 vs. 24), Geno Beam (Mg. Power 48 vs. 40) and Geno[CR]Flash/Geno Flare (Mg. Power 90 vs. 85) have seen a significant Mg. Power[CR]increase. Spire and Sleepy Time has seen Mg. power decreases but are ALSO the[CR]only other specials blessed with the Jump Counter bump still. Geno Whirl now[CR]costs 8 FP and Terrorize now does damage again. All enemies, bosses,[CR]characters, weapons equipment, jump counters (Yes, the one that's attached to[CR]Jump), timing, items, specials, and level ups are now completely balanced.[CR]Save Point in Bowser's Castle moved back out of Croco's Room and placed before[CR]Kamek to fix a glitchy bug that occurs in the Factory section of the Gate[CR]area. All messages have been proofread and edited. "Bob" the Shy Ranger now[CR]has a more appropriate name. Slight dialogue change, talk to the guy behind[CR]the house to the left of the castle in Mushroom Kingdom at the beginning![CR]Triplets' Shop sells more useful selection of items and also sells a very much[CR]improved "Mushroom". Bad Mushroom can mute OR Poison enemies. A few bosses[CR]have been tweaked and/or improved to be more balanced and/or difficult. Culex[CR]will still kill you at any Level if you're not careful. ALL FUTURE RELEASES[CR]WILL BE FOR THE SAKE OF BUG FIXING! V4.0 - FINAL Release. Nearly Complete[CR]overhaul of the hack. Names of enemies, attacks and spells edited to be more[CR]fitting to the Japanese version of the game and to make more sense out of the[CR]attack. The pricing of Sleepy Bomb is fixed. Mallow given Thunderbolt as his[CR]first special again. All enemies and bosses are balanced as best as possible.[CR]Some enemies and bosses have seen improvements to their scripts to make sure[CR]that the game is fair but giving off a challenging vibe. New equipment and[CR]items have been made, while some items have been changed to be made more[CR]useful. Most other equipment has been tweaked to maintain that balance. EXP[CR]and monetary gains have been tweaked to be generally more rewarding but to[CR]establish a flow with the game. Characters and characters' stats have been[CR]tweaked to bring a greater balance between the party members. Bosses have all[CR]been tested to ensure that no bugs or oddities exist any more. The bug with[CR]the Specials menu where characters would learn a special at Level 51 has been[CR]fixed. Smithy, Jinx, and Culex have been tweaked. Some enemy spells have been[CR]made weaker for balancing issues. Save point before Kamek/Magikoopa has been[CR]moved into the room with Croco's 2nd shop to prevent problems of possibly[CR]"getting stuck" due to Kamek/Magikoopa's increased difficulty. Two of the[CR]three Musty Fears' flags have been moved. V3.0 - Pending FINAL release. Fixed[CR]the bugs with Shy Rangers, Axem Rangers and Helios. Fixed a few goofy battle[CR]formations. Bugs with Defender, Exor that were found were also fixed. Battle[CR]Scripts have been looked over and improved if needed. Enemies and bosses[CR]received one last thorough balancing, so that the difficulty curve is better[CR]maintained. Bowser's Terrorize special no longer does damage. Peach's Sleepy[CR]Time special now does damage (Mg. Power of 50). Peach's Mute Special now will[CR]never miss. Timing for Geno Whirl has been lowered from 8 frames to 5 now.[CR]Prices at the Frog Disciple's Shop has been lowered. Various accessories and[CR]equipment improved. Fixed a mistake with Yoshi Candy. Fixed Falcon Helm and[CR]Red Cap not protecting characters from certains status effects. Increased EXP[CR]gain for Machine Made enemies and some of the enemies in Forest Maze (for[CR]easier leveling up). V2.0 - Fixed most of the bugs and glitches of all the[CR]bosses, enemies, and battle formations with testing involved. Buffed Falcon[CR]Helm and Red Cap even more (status protection), A few bosses has been changed[CR]from before: a few are less annoying, but more are harder. Geno Boost only[CR]boosts Attack and Magic Defense now, but still has 2 frames for Defense. Only[CR]few minor bugs remains, but the hack is officially complete! V1.30 and V1.31 -[CR]Fixed a few problems with Culex (NOT MAJOR), and a horrible Level-up bug[CR](Broken Peach, and broken stats). Also, Geno Boost and Ultra Jump has been[CR]balanced even more, but frame for timing is increased for Geno Boost slightly.[CR]Also, minor changes and fixes to some bosses. V1.20 and V1.21 - Fixes major[CR]battle bugs with Croco #2, Machine Made Yaridovich, Replacement Boss, and[CR]Culex. Also, Smithy, Jinx and Culex have been severely revamped and star[CR]grinding is less broken. Mallow and Geno have been buffed and a few of their[CR]specials improved. Stats and prices of certain pieces of equipment and items[CR]improved. Version 1.20 has V1.1a's characters specials table while Version[CR]1.21 has the new specials table. Example: Bowser learns Bowser Crush at Level[CR]37 in V1.20, he will learn the same special at Level 30 in V1.21. EDIT: V1.1a[CR]fixes the problem with Yoshi-Ade. In V1.1, Yoshi-Ade is so broken that it[CR]freezes the game. Also, the last boss got an increase in attack power for good[CR]reason. * Characters can go level up to Level 50 * All bosses and enemies'[CR]battle scripts changed * Character stats changed around * Spells changed * All[CR]Enemy stats changed * Dialogue changes (Mostly in-battle) * New enemies and[CR]enemy name changes * Well-balanced difficulty curve * Timing for Weapons,[CR]defense and spells changed * A few new attacks and spells * Some new items and[CR]equipments Changes made from Remix (an older version): * Solves problems with[CR]some enemies/bosses with multiple attacks (i.e. Enemies attacking after[CR]characters have died, leads to bug where enemy jumps offscreen and attacks[CR]nothing, only to come back some minutes later). * Mallow with Shocker at the[CR]beginning instead of Thunderbolt as his first spell (Some enemies changed a[CR]bit to compensate for this). * Balance out stats between characters and[CR]increase HP stat boosts * Change enemy encounters around a bit (i.e. Mushroom[CR]Way, a Goomba encounter might give you two Goombas and a Koopa Troopa). *[CR]Improved certain boss and enemy tactics as well as stats to make a little[CR]tougher/more balanced. * Fixed the bug where it says that your character will[CR]gain a new special at Level 51. The max level is 50 in this game. * Changed[CR]Geno Whirl's stats (It will always hit now, sometimes will hit 9999 on its[CR]own, but timing for guaranteed 9999 is VERY hard like Geno Boost's). * Changed[CR]stats for a few pieces of equipment (Masher, Lazy Shell). * ALL Weapons have[CR]small changes to timing (Mainly just for the strongest level of the attack). *[CR]Changes to most Psychopath messages * Fixed problem with "Ready, Get Set, Go!"[CR]message on Booster Hill. * Small fixes with some out-of-battle text messages *[CR]Improved enemy evasion for most enemies. * Balanced FP cost and all-targeting[CR]attacks * Lessened overall EXP gain to compensate for Lucky Jewel, Lucky![CR]Bonus, and the special Hammer. * EXP Booster costs twice the amount of Coin[CR]Trick now. * Balanced the stat-boosting items Addendum: The archive was[CR]updated to fix the headered patch included, greatly reducing filesize of the[CR]archive. The non-headered patch and readme are unchanged.[CR]Read[CR]Me:[CR]Super Mario RPG Revolution - A ROM Hack by Waddler-D.[CR]Progress[CR]Report[CR]---------------[CR]V5.0 - ABSOLUTE Release.

Tweaked[CR]Smithys Body Attack Power to present more of a challenge.[CR]V1.1 - Improved a[CR]few enemies scripts and made a quick glance for bugs with all enemies and[CR]bosses. All future updates will most likely be for aesthetic or clean-up[CR]reasons.[CR]V1.0b (Short-lived) - Fixes annoying script hiccups with Croco[CR](Moleville Mines), Grate Guy and Dodo (the optional variant).[CR]V1.0a - Fixed[CR]Bowsers Castle #1 monster formation packs. Apparently, a late game boss would[CR]pretty much prevent anybody from progressing. The problem was figured out and[CR]solved.[CR]V1.0 - Initial Release[CR]NOTE: This hack is in essence a BALANCED[CR]difficulty hack and asks for the player to know how to time well and to use[CR]their head against gimmicky enemies and bosses. While grinding is possible, it[CR]is balanced and can be time-consuming, but going through the bosses at the[CR]recommended levels below will give you an idea of where you need to be at[CR]which point.

You can also use ZSNES 1.42 or V1.50[CR]but the emulator is not optimal for Super Mario RPG, dont use ZSNES 1.51 or[CR]else youll get that freezing bug).[CR]The "SMRPGRevolutionV5.0.ips" patch is[CR]for SMRPG ROMs that have no header (Theyre 4,096 KB as a result) while the[CR]"SMRPGRevolutionV5.0Headered.ips" patch is for SMRPG ROMs that have a header[CR](Theyre 4,097 KB). Those that have a SMRPG ROM thats patched with V4.1 should[CR]use the "SMRPGRevolutionV4.1V5.0.ips" patch if they would like to continue[CR]their progress. However, this is not recommended due to save compatibility[CR]issues.[CR]NOTE: For those that have progressed into V4.1, I WILL release a[CR]V4.1 to V5.0 patch. However, save compatibility is definitely not a guarantee[CR]here. There are much more changes with V5.0 that were not present with[CR]V4.0/V4.1 and could experience some considerable problems. Id RECOMMEND[CR]starting over but you certainly dont have to if you dont want to at all. Id[CR]highly advise NOT updating to V5.0 if you want to continue off a save in V4.1[CR]thats beyond the fight with Magikoopa in Bowsers Castle the second time[CR]through.[CR]Known Bugs[CR]1. Therapy and Group Hug apparently nullify Red[CR]Essence Effects for some unknown reason. The properities of the two specials[CR]are entirely the same as they were in the original, except for FP cost and[CR]Magic Power. It may have been a bug in the original as well...[CR]2. If[CR]Octovader kills himself with his own spell and is the only enemy alive, the[CR]battle lingers a bit longer, but will end shortly. Also the same goes for[CR]enemies using Psyche or Migraine, there is a slight delay.[CR]Unknown[CR]Bugs[CR]-Please report any bugs that you experience throughout the course of[CR]play and I try my best to get them fixed!-[CR]I suggest checking out this[CR]link: (http://www.zophar.net/utilities/patchutil.html). Available here are[CR]programs that will make patching the ROM easy and user-friendly.[CR]I would[CR]like to thank the hacking information on http://giangurgolo.home.att.net/smrpg[CR]and the Lazy Shell program made by Gianurgolo and his team. It was rather[CR]helpful in improving my SMRPG hack to the way it is now.[CR]IMPORTANT NOTE:[CR]Please ask me for permission before using this hack for any addition. If you[CR]are curious about how to increase the maximum level, I will gladly help on[CR]that. However, if you do use anything from this hack in any way, please give[CR]credit where credit is due...[CR]If you have any questions, comments,[CR]complaints, etc. Contact me via WaddlerD 85 on AIM or waddler-d on Skype. Id[CR]suggest the latter.[CR]This patch is only a ROM hack to the original game,[CR]Super Mario RPG.

    <plot>Many years into the future, after the former heroes of the Mushroom Kingdom no[CR]longer exist; strange events begin to take place when the new antagonist:[CR]Nova, moves onto the island. A young boy by the name of Mute, has been[CR]recruited by the new princess of the Mushroom Kingdom to help fight for what's[CR]left of the land. But does he have what it takes to defeat Nova? Play the[CR]first episode of the action pack series, "Super Mute World." Important Note:[CR]For the best results, use ZSNES. There's a few problems that need to be fixed[CR]to make it compatible with BSNES, but it's perfectly compatible with[CR]ZSNES.[CR]Read Me:[CR]Here is the newest released version of Super Mario[CR]World "The After Years" and also the first installment to the Super Mute World[CR]Series. [CR](4 Episodes in total plus a few side series.) [CR]-This update[CR]includes-[CR]1. New and Revamped levels: Well there isnt actually any extra[CR]levels but some levels have been revamped completely to where they can be[CR]considered new. Some of the old levels are still there but a bit more updated.[CR]Some levels are a bit less linear and there are a some bonus areas added to[CR]the levels in such. [CR]2. New Overworld: While it may not be an over the top[CR]overworld, I still tried my hardest to make it. (No laziness or half effort.)[CR]Good effort should count for at least something. There are also a few event[CR]changes in such. There were a few dead end levels that were useless to play at[CR]first but every level that is a dead end now are somewhat important. (You no[CR]longer access the special world the same way anymore.) [CR]3. New and Updated[CR]Graphics: A few levels have graphics changed around in such. There are also a[CR]few levels that Ive edited the graphics myself in YYCHR, like Starlight[CR]Park.[CR]4. Bosses: A few boss fights were changed around and World 2 now has[CR]a different boss then before. Also redid the final boss fight. (The early[CR]version was kind of blah.) [CR]5. Cut scenes and Knock Back: Cut scenes are[CR]now able to be skipped and the knock back effect was decreased a lot. I[CR]couldnt get rid of it fully sadly but you should have more control of how far[CR]you get hit back. [CR]6. Soundtrack: A lot of tracks for the levels were[CR]changed around. I tried to go with more underused tracks or just tracks I like[CR]a lot. (Regardless of being overused.) [CR]- Special Credit List[CR]-[CR]TheHellWind84: (My Brother) - Mutes Graphics and part of Novas Graphics.[CR]Daizo Dee Von: World 2 Submap, World 8 Submap Graphics, Helped with Mutes[CR]Shading, and made the other part of Novas Graphics. Also some credit for[CR]originally helping with perspective errors in the first version.[CR]MaxodeX:[CR]Megaman X - Spark Mandrills Stage Port (Extermination Sites Track.) Megaman[CR]and Bass - Magic Mans Stage Port. (Starlight Tower and Secret Funzones Track.)[CR]Masterlink: Secret of Mana - The Holy Intruder (Prison Outbreak and[CR]Volcano Castles Track.) [CR]MarioStarLuigi: Final Fantasy 6 - Terra (World 3s[CR]Submap Track.) [CR]IceGuy: Ultimate Noob Boss. Well if it wasnt for this boss,[CR]I wouldnt have some bosses so Im thankful for that.[CR]cstutor89: Though he[CR]didnt beta test this version, he beta tested the first version and some of[CR]those levels are still in this version so credit is still due. [CR]Super Mario[CR]World Central: For making it happen![CR]If you have any questions concerning[CR]the hack please feel free to PM me. Feel free to lets play, playthrough,[CR]walkthrough, TAS or Speed Run![CR]-EvilGuy019-</plot>

    <plot>This hack of Super Mario World is an idea of making a sequel to the original[CR]Mario World in a way of BIGGER, LONGER; HARDER AND COOLER. We worked over 2[CR]years on it. It is mostly vanilla - it has a lot of custom palettes, lots of[CR]MAP16 use of original graphics, 2 custom blocks (star-break- block / No Yoshi-[CR]block) and over 100 exits. It is very puzzlingly and challenging, but still[CR]has a very relaxing difficulty in the first worlds. The Lunatic world is[CR]extremely challenging. We hope you all enjoy this hack as much as we did[CR]making and playing it, too! A complete walk-through (Let's Play) you can find[CR]here at Ninjaboys channel:  A GERMAN walk-through with the final version of[CR]the hack you can find here at Dusselchens channel:  Length: 106 exit(s) Don't[CR]forget to apply a header to the ROM before patching it!</plot>

    <plot>This hack of Super Mario World is an idea of making a sequel to the original[CR]Mario World in a way of BIGGER, LONGER; HARDER AND COOLER. We worked over 2[CR]years on it. It is mostly vanilla - it has a lot of custom palettes, lots of[CR]MAP16 use of original graphics, 2 custom blocks (star-break- block / No Yoshi-[CR]block) and over 100 exits. It is very puzzlingly and challenging, but still[CR]has a very relaxing difficulty in the first worlds. The Lunatic world is[CR]extremely challenging. We hope you all enjoy this hack as much as we did[CR]making and playing it, too! A complete walk-through (Let's Play) you can find[CR]here at Ninjaboys channel:  A GERMAN walk-through with the final version of[CR]the hack you can find here at Dusselchens channel:  Length: 106 exit(s) Don't[CR]forget to apply a header to the ROM before patching it!</plot>

    <plot>Note: Only works fully in ZSNES 1.51+. May be glitchy in other emulators.[CR]Story: Mario and Luigi were heading back to Peach's Castle after another one[CR]of their amazing adventures, however as soon as they walk in, Peach sends them[CR]out on another mission to collect the 7 Golden Statues which Bowser had stolen[CR]from her not long ago. Where did they come from? And what's so bad about[CR]Bowser stealing some statues? Play and find out! Even when the game ends,[CR]there's more to do! Features: * A few new animations * Ground Pounding * New[CR]Power-ups * Custom Enemies * Custom Music * Custom Bosses * Item System (like[CR]SMB3/NSMBW) * Pause Menu * An Original Mario-like Story And much much more![CR]Known bugs: * Luigi might sometimes cause the music to reset on the Overworld[CR]when in World 4 and 6. * Luigi will use Mario's GFX on the Overworld[CR]temporarily when you save the game, reset and come back to it. * When using[CR]the Ice Flower, Mario/Luigi revert to their normal colors on the Overworld[CR]because for some reason they are transparent when they have that power while[CR]on the Overworld. * At certain points in the game Luigi might warp to other[CR]places on the map. Don't worry however you cannot get stuck anywhere because[CR]of a feature put in which won't be spoiled here.</plot>

    <plot>Nearly 7 months in the making, and it's finally finished. Every room has been[CR]disassembled and remade, and several areas of the planet bear no resemblance[CR]to what they once were. Walljumping is absolutely required from the very[CR]beginning. Other techniques that are required to complete the game are[CR]"infinite" single-wall walljumping (only in a couple of places though), single[CR]bombjumping, and the midair morph. Some insane crumble block skills are also[CR]required. As with most hacks, "infinite" bombjumping is not required. There's[CR]some early difficulty with crumble blocks but if you do have problems, you can[CR]try to abuse savestates to get through it and move on to the juicy[CR]exploration-based center. Save states are required because of the lack of save[CR]points, they cause bad errors when inserted into this game.[CR]Read[CR]Me:[CR]-Golden Dawn-[CR]...[CR]aka Particulate Matter in the Upper Atmosphere[CR]During the Early Morning Hours[CR]---[CR]By Black Telomeres[CR]---[CR]First[CR]off, just as a warning to any less experienced players, walljumping is[CR]absolutely required from the very beginning. Other techniques that are[CR]required to complete the game are "infinite" one-wall walljumping, single[CR]bombjumping, and the midair morph. Some madd crumble block skillz are also[CR]required. As with most hacks, "infinite" bombjumping is not[CR]required.[CR]Similarly to Dependence, save states are required because sadly[CR]there are no consistant, reliable regular save points. They cause even worse[CR]errors in this game when implemented than they did in Dependence. Try to keep[CR]a backup savestate, also. While this game has been playtested a lot and you[CR]shouldnt be able to get truly stuck at any point, as with almost any game, you[CR]can never rule out the possibility that you could get into a difficult area[CR]with low health and have a tough time escaping or something of that[CR]nature.[CR]Physical difficulty (i.e. the need for feats of manual dexterity)[CR]is definitely stepped up from Dependence. Also, unlike that hack, this one is[CR]less nonlinear in the order of the bosses you fight and items you collect,[CR]although path you follow through the areas may be quite nonlinear, most[CR]notably the many connecting passages throughout the opening area. Its still[CR]about as nonlinear as most other hacks out there though.[CR]Known[CR]Issues[CR]------------[CR]If you come across any of these, it isnt necessary[CR]to report them, as theyre already known, just either are impossible to fix or[CR]would require an inordinate amount of effort to fix.[CR]1. In a room with a[CR]silver Chozo or rising/lowering pipes, if you jump or move at the right angle,[CR]you may notice a small segment of said item flashing for a second or so in an[CR]out of place part of the room. This little bug is innate to the SM engine; the[CR]SM programmers merely worked around it by not using these in ways in which[CR]might cause this little graphical glitch. Dependence probably had a few[CR]instances of this glitch as well.[CR]2. A few doors have a brief graphic[CR]glitch during door transition in a specific direction. This bug is also innate[CR]to the SM engine - but once again, with the way the programmers used the[CR]tilesets in the normal SM, you never had a chance to see any of these little[CR]glitches. Dependence and some other hacks also have this in a few areas.[CR]3.[CR]In a few specific rooms throughout the game (maybe 4 or 5), if you pause, you[CR]may notice a glitched up map screen. Do not fear; this is not permanent. If[CR]you leave that room and pause in one of the vast majority of rooms, youll see[CR]that your map is still in correct working order.[CR]4. Occasional background[CR]blending issues in some sky rooms.[CR]---[CR]Random optional reading that has[CR]tiny spoilers:[CR]You may want to refrain from pausing the game during certain[CR]boss battles unless you really need to or else YOU WILL DISCOVER THE TERRIBLE,[CR]TERRIBLE SECRET OF SPACE.[CR]If you manage to sequence break to get into the[CR]EH using infinite bomb jumping, you will have to infinite bomb jump again to[CR]progress in there. You have been warned.[CR]For half of the escape, for a[CR]certain reason, you will not be able to read the countdown timer.[CR]Unfortunately, its the latter half. However, it also adds the interesting[CR]dimension of uncertainty as to how much time is left.[CR]---[CR]Also, a bit of[CR]a spoilery warning, basically only to expert/hardcore sequence breakers:[CR]If[CR]you should, through use of frame advance or insane Super Metroid skillz, get[CR]up a certain spikelined shaft with super missile blocks that close off the top[CR]WITHOUT the space jump, keep an extra save state handy before you go further,[CR]or else, if you continue on, youll get stuck near the end.</plot>

    <plot>Super Metroid 2015 (Project Base 7.2 Nintendit) by dex909 [Version 1.57][CR]Thanks to begrimed and everyone at the Metroid Construction IRC. Changes to[CR]Project Base: This patch is meant as an alternative version to Begrimed's[CR]Project Base 7.2 to make it appear like a slightly altered Vanilla Super[CR]Metroid. Think of it as an attempt to recreate a re-release as Nintendo might[CR]have intended - or should we say... "Nintended"? ;) The Nintendit uses Project[CR]Base 7.2 "Project_Base_0.7.2_Vanilla_Gameplay.ips" as base and combines it[CR]with "Project_Base_0.7.2_Gameplay_Only.ips". The patch will work with an[CR]unheadered rom of Super Metroid e.g. "Super Metroid (JU) [!].smc" Alterations[CR]besides this: * Clear Message Boxes (transparent, no black backgrounds),[CR]changes to message colours * Fanfare as in vanilla SM but skippable (time for[CR]message boxes shortened as it is in PB 7.2) * All save rooms and corresponding[CR]map icons are working as intended by Begrimed's Project Base 7.2 * Sounds for[CR]Samus landing, flipping and walljumping adjusted to the sounds PB 7.2 uses *[CR]Original grey Nintendo logo at boot * Vanilla enemies (vanilla enemy graphics[CR]as well as AI) * Vanilla Ceres escape sequence (besides altered tileset from[CR]PB 7.2) * Haze in title screen, Ceres and Game Over screen * altered/smoother[CR]PB 7.2 version logo in title screen (computer screen edit) * Edited "2015'' in[CR]title screen, the way the original small copyright font worked * Coloured[CR]Samus Item Menu (from RealRed patch) as in PB 7.2 * Smooth map scrolling in[CR]menu * Added in the original mountains to the Crateria landing site (changed[CR]palette to make them look as if they would at night instead of rain) * Green[CR]logo palettes (including fade-in/instant fade-in palettes) * Less screen[CR]shakes when using Super Missiles (as in PB 7.2) * Bomb timer adjusted to PB[CR]7.2 values * Red doors take 5 missile hits as in vanilla SM * Maridia Palette[CR]Change (less pink) * Several minor background changes to certain rooms There[CR]are three versions of this hack: Super Metroid (JU) [!] [h] [2015] [Project[CR]Base 7.2 Nintendit].ips * Original Nintendid, everything mentioned above with[CR]vanilla enemies Super Metroid (JU) [!] [h] [2015] [Project Base 7.2 Nintendit][CR][Enemy Edits].ips * Everything mentioned above with edited enemy AI, headers,[CR]routines, drops and enemy graphics edits from Project Base 7.2 Super Metroid[CR](JU) [!] [h] [2015].ips * Only the gameplay changes from PB as well as[CR]transparent item windows, less intrusive SFX, coloured Samus item window and[CR]smooth map scrolling ABOUT PROJECT BASE version 0.7.2 - may 14, 2015 Project[CR]Base is a ROM hack of Super Metroid that keeps the original map mostly intact,[CR]while adding new stuff.

[CR]Version 2.1 I swear this is the final FINAL[CR]one![CR]--------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Super Metroid: Redesign by[CR]Drewseph[CR]--------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Fixes-[CR]Removed several annoying glitches when loading from save stations and not[CR]having the icon match up with x/y[CR] Made sure there are fewer problems upon[CR]trying to unmorph after springballing through a maze.[CR] Fixed a few small[CR]graphical issues in a couple of[CR]rooms.[CR]************Important***************[CR] The zip containing the[CR]patch is password protected. Please read the document to get the password to[CR]the zip, and also refer back to the document for any help.[CR]E-mail:[CR]drewseph0011@gmail.com[CR]IRC channel: irc.metroid2002.com [CR]Room:[CR]#smr[CR]Updates:[CR] Once again many rooms have been tweaked a bit to offer[CR]better tile continuity. A few of the morphball passages have been fixed so[CR]hopefully its less[CR] frequent to get "stuck" in ball form after exiting. I[CR]made a few of the morphball passages a bit more obvious, specifically the[CR]passage to the left [CR] of norfair elevator. added slopes in certain lava pit[CR]of doom, so exiting is easier. Thank you for playing, Read on![CR]Table of[CR]contents:[CR]-Introduction-[CR]-Installation-[CR]-New[CR]Features-[CR]-Troubleshooting-[CR]-Credits-[CR]-Introduction-[CR]------------------------------------[CR]Redesign started as an introduction for me (Drewseph) to SMILE and to[CR]learn what its uses and limitations were. I have always loved Super[CR]Metroid [CR]and have played it constantly since I was a teenager, in fact, I[CR]have been [CR]drawing up Metroid 1 maps since I was in kindergarten. This hack[CR]is simply a [CR]Re-telling of a classic game with drastic changes to the[CR]physics and the abilities [CR]gained during the adventure. [CR] In reality[CR]this hack has been scrapped and redone around 3 times in the [CR]past 2 years.[CR]It started with Re-tiling all of Craterias rooms, and then [CR]rearranging all[CR]of Brinstars door destinations.... Then Norfair, [CR]where for the first time[CR]I changed the room dimensions and door destinations. I [CR]had completed 3[CR]whole areas when I finally realized a GOOD hack had to have NO [CR]rooms that[CR]could be distinguished from the original in any fashion.[CR] I then set out on[CR]remapping Brinstar and Norfair again until I discovered [CR]I could EXPAND[CR]every single room past the original size limitations. Thats when [CR]I once[CR]again started over entirely with one goal in mind...[CR] Turn a 30-minute[CR]Adventure in to a 2-hour adventure.[CR]By this time a huge list of ideas and[CR]new abilities had come to mind. The [CR]physics had been changed, but needed[CR]the skill of a few very talented friends to [CR]make my vision come[CR]true...[CR] So now I give you Redesign; a Simple name, but clearly states my[CR]intentions for the hack, a COMPLETE Redesign of Super Metroid, while[CR]staying true [CR]to the story and atmosphere of the original. [CR]The zip file[CR]is pasworded so you can read this text before diving into [CR]the game. The[CR]password is: redesign_of_a_classic[CR] Thank you for playing my dream, even if[CR]you hate what I have done, at [CR]least youll see a new original hack.[CR]-INSTALLATION-[CR]--------------------------------------------------------------[CR]-Unzip[CR]Super_Metroid_Redesign.zip by using the correct password to get[CR]Super_Metroid_Redesign.ips[CR] -I used Winzip9.0, and win RAR to test[CR]unzipping, both worked.[CR]-Apply the ips patch directly to "Super Metroid[CR](JU)" rom using lunar ips [CR] (http://fusoya.panicus.org/lips/index.html) or[CR]any other ips application (this is just the one i use)[CR]-Play[CR]-NEW[CR]FEATURES-[CR]--------------------------------------------------------------[CR]-Physics[CR]Changes: Something that always bothered me has been the horribly slow falling[CR]speed in this game. [CR] Every time I jumped I felt like I was wasting time[CR]waiting to land on the ground. [CR] My reason for changing it is backed up by[CR]a Pirate data in Metroid Prime that states Zebes total [CR] mass nearly[CR]equivalent to Tallon VI. I also Favored changing the physics because in every[CR]SM [CR] hack Ive played I get bored rather quickly because I already know[CR]everything there is. I know [CR] where I can wall jump, that I can bomb jump[CR]places, that I can easily get around this place by [CR] doing another thing. I[CR]have also modified bomb jumping to return to the fast falling speeds of[CR] M1[CR]and Metroid Prime. Many tricks you knew in the original will need to be[CR]relearned which brings[CR] back that "unfamiliar" feeling of gameplay. THATS[CR]why I changed the physics.[CR]-New Items: There are 2 new major upgrades that[CR]Samus will need to complete her adventure. One of them is [CR] required, the[CR]other a simple weapons addition to enhance your fire power. Hi-Jump boots[CR]now[CR] come packaged with Spring-Ball.[CR]-Abilities: Wall jumping has become[CR]a bigger part in this hack. IF a wall is rocky and has a gripping surface[CR]then Samus will be able to wall jump off of it. However if the wall is a[CR]smooth pipe, or an algae[CR] covered seawall, then Samus wont be able to get[CR]ANY grip to jump from. A new technique that was [CR] Alien to SM has finally[CR]been added to the game as well, and youll need to use it carefully if you [CR]wish to get all 100%[CR]items.[CR]-Troubleshooting-[CR]-------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Q:[CR]I am using Zsnes and the game doesnt work/appears as a garbled mess. How do[CR] I get it to work?[CR]A: Zsnes 1.4x does not seem to support the game,[CR]however previous versions like [CR] 1.36 works, as will future versions of[CR]Zsnes.[CR]Q: I seem to be stuck in an area where it looks like I have to use[CR]the infinite [CR] bomb jump to get out, and it seems too difficult for me to[CR]do it. What do I do?[CR]A:The Infinite bomb jump is NEVER required to beat[CR]this hack, so if you find yourself doing this to get somewhere, you might want[CR]to turn around and get[CR] the item that you need. It is, however, nessicary[CR]to get 100% items. [CR]Q: Crateria seems rather dark and I cant see[CR]much.[CR]A: Adjust the settings on your monitor so its brighter. Its an[CR]obvious [CR]solution, but some people (I am looking at you, Jigglysaint) may[CR]not get it right [CR]away.[CR]Q: It burns!!!![CR]A: Just keep on[CR]running...[CR]-Credits-[CR]--------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Project[CR]Leader/Level Design: -Drewseph-[CR]Main Programmer: -Kejardon-[CR]Additional[CR]Programmers: -Jathys-[CR] -Jman2050-[CR] -MathOnNapkins-[CR]Beta Testers:[CR]-Atma-[CR] -Dart-Zaidyer-[CR] -Insom-[CR] -Interdpth-[CR] -Jigglysaint-[CR]-Jman2050-[CR]-Kejardon-[CR]--------------------------------------------------------------[CR]All[CR]trademarks and copyrights contained in this folder are owned by[CR]their[CR]respective trademark and copyright holders.

    <plot>Post-traumatic Sidehopper Disorder. Story (for those who want a pretend reason[CR]to play): With almost all of the Metroids wiped out, the scientists at the[CR]colony of Ceres conducted many experiments on the captive baby Samus delivered[CR]to them. The results of one of the experiments in particular fascinated the[CR]researchers; the Metroids had a staggeringly high energy output. The power[CR]generated from a single Metroid larvae could be harnessed to power an entire[CR]city. However, the Metroids were also highly unstable and any form of[CR]interruption to their flow of energy could trigger a cataclysmic explosion.[CR]The scientists sent the Metroid to power a small colony near Ceres, to test[CR]the real life application of their new found knowledge. All seemed well for[CR]some time, however less than a month after the Metroid was delivered, the[CR]Galactic Federation recieved a distress signal from the colony; they were[CR]under attack! The GF contacted Samus immediately, for she had the most[CR]experience with the Metroids. Not one to turn down such an offer, Samus[CR]immediately left for the colony to discover what was amiss.</plot>

    <plot>This hack is a complete make over of planet Zebes level-design wise, very few[CR]rooms actually look like they used to be. The planet is a little bigger now,[CR]it still relies on the original region structure but laid out differently. The[CR]game-play is unchanged, no new abilities or stuff like that. However, they're[CR]numerous small ASM changes and tweaks, mainly on PLM and enemies so as to keep[CR]the player interested in exploring. Item progression and item count has been[CR]sightly altered. Sequence breaking is also possible to some extent (might not[CR]be as permissive as SM tough) This is NOT a hard hack but more difficult than[CR]the original game. Special/advanced techniques are NOT required to beat it. If[CR]you're not used to performing shine-spark maneuvers as well as the mid-air[CR]morph ball, you may have trouble getting some places later in this hack.[CR]Included are also all old versions of the patch if you wish to experiment with[CR]them also.[CR]Read Me:[CR]Author:[CR]Metaquarius[CR]Z-Factor[CR]---------------------------------------[CR]November[CR]30, 2012[CR]Yay, Im eventually done with my first hacking project. 2 years and[CR]a half working on this. Time has come to do a short[CR]presentation.[CR]-------------------[CR]DESCRIPTION[CR]This hack is a complete[CR]make over of planet Zebes level-design wise, very few rooms actually look like[CR]they used to be. The planet is a little bigger now, it still relies on the[CR]original region structure but layed out differently. The gameplay is[CR]unchanged, no new abilities or stuff like that.[CR]However, therere numerous[CR]small ASM changes and tweaks, mainly on PLM and enemies so as to keep the[CR]player interested in exploring. Item progression and item count has been[CR]sightly altered. Sequence breaking is also possible to some extent (might not[CR]be as permissive as SM tough)[CR]This is NOT a hard hack but more difficult[CR]than the original game. Special/advanced techniques are NOT required to beat[CR]it. If youre not used to performing shinespark manoevers as well as the mid-[CR]air morph ball, you may have trouble getting some places later in this[CR]hack.[CR]-------------------[CR]ABOUT THE PROJECT[CR]This project was a really[CR]interesting, but time-consuming experience, Im globally satisfied with the[CR]result. My original motivation came from when Ive played Legacy some years[CR]ago, I sensed there were grounds for building a much more interesting and[CR]extensive hack, something really close to the way SM is played but with a new[CR]aventure on Zebes.[CR]Then as I gain more experience in the haking field, this[CR]project quickly became sort of a personal challenge, so as to prove myself[CR]capable of running a lenghty project from start to end alone. I always wanted[CR]to keep the hack simple, not really to aim at an overhaul hack that would[CR]require huge effort and time for a questionnable result.[CR]Still, this year[CR]was very intense in the process of making this hack, I was forced somehow to[CR]rework on entire areas at some point. Several side projects like the Omega[CR]Metroid boss fight slowed down work on this hack but eventually I think it was[CR]necessary to make some pauses once in a while.[CR]I still dont even realize[CR]its done now, after all of this time struggling against dozen of relunctant[CR]shit... haaaa, memories. But enough talk, Im looking forward your comments or[CR]reviews on this hack.[CR]Happy exploring[CR]![CR]-------------------[CR]THANKS[CR]Special thanks to Jathys for making[CR]SMILE.[CR]Thanks to Kejardon, JAM, Grime, Sadiztyk Fish, Black Falcon,[CR]squishy_ichigo, GF_Kennon for their incredibly useful documentations on Super[CR]Metroid.[CR]-------------------[CR]COPYRIGHT[CR]Super Metroid is a registered[CR]trademark of its copyright holder.[CR]This hack was made for pure[CR]entertainment and should not be sold by anyone.

[CR]Version 2.1 I swear this is the final FINAL[CR]one![CR]--------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Super Metroid: Redesign by[CR]Drewseph[CR]--------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Fixes-[CR]Removed several annoying glitches when loading from save stations and not[CR]having the icon match up with x/y[CR] Made sure there are fewer problems upon[CR]trying to unmorph after springballing through a maze.[CR] Fixed a few small[CR]graphical issues in a couple of[CR]rooms.[CR]************Important***************[CR] The zip containing the[CR]patch is password protected. Please read the document to get the password to[CR]the zip, and also refer back to the document for any help.[CR]E-mail:[CR]drewseph0011@gmail.com[CR]IRC channel: irc.metroid2002.com [CR]Room:[CR]#smr[CR]Updates:[CR] Once again many rooms have been tweaked a bit to offer[CR]better tile continuity. A few of the morphball passages have been fixed so[CR]hopefully its less[CR] frequent to get "stuck" in ball form after exiting. I[CR]made a few of the morphball passages a bit more obvious, specifically the[CR]passage to the left [CR] of norfair elevator. added slopes in certain lava pit[CR]of doom, so exiting is easier. Thank you for playing, Read on![CR]Table of[CR]contents:[CR]-Introduction-[CR]-Installation-[CR]-New[CR]Features-[CR]-Troubleshooting-[CR]-Credits-[CR]-Introduction-[CR]------------------------------------[CR]Redesign started as an introduction for me (Drewseph) to SMILE and to[CR]learn what its uses and limitations were. I have always loved Super[CR]Metroid [CR]and have played it constantly since I was a teenager, in fact, I[CR]have been [CR]drawing up Metroid 1 maps since I was in kindergarten. This hack[CR]is simply a [CR]Re-telling of a classic game with drastic changes to the[CR]physics and the abilities [CR]gained during the adventure. [CR] In reality[CR]this hack has been scrapped and redone around 3 times in the [CR]past 2 years.[CR]It started with Re-tiling all of Craterias rooms, and then [CR]rearranging all[CR]of Brinstars door destinations.... Then Norfair, [CR]where for the first time[CR]I changed the room dimensions and door destinations. I [CR]had completed 3[CR]whole areas when I finally realized a GOOD hack had to have NO [CR]rooms that[CR]could be distinguished from the original in any fashion.[CR] I then set out on[CR]remapping Brinstar and Norfair again until I discovered [CR]I could EXPAND[CR]every single room past the original size limitations. Thats when [CR]I once[CR]again started over entirely with one goal in mind...[CR] Turn a 30-minute[CR]Adventure in to a 2-hour adventure.[CR]By this time a huge list of ideas and[CR]new abilities had come to mind. The [CR]physics had been changed, but needed[CR]the skill of a few very talented friends to [CR]make my vision come[CR]true...[CR] So now I give you Redesign; a Simple name, but clearly states my[CR]intentions for the hack, a COMPLETE Redesign of Super Metroid, while[CR]staying true [CR]to the story and atmosphere of the original. [CR]The zip file[CR]is pasworded so you can read this text before diving into [CR]the game. The[CR]password is: redesign_of_a_classic[CR] Thank you for playing my dream, even if[CR]you hate what I have done, at [CR]least youll see a new original hack.[CR]-INSTALLATION-[CR]--------------------------------------------------------------[CR]-Unzip[CR]Super_Metroid_Redesign.zip by using the correct password to get[CR]Super_Metroid_Redesign.ips[CR] -I used Winzip9.0, and win RAR to test[CR]unzipping, both worked.[CR]-Apply the ips patch directly to "Super Metroid[CR](JU)" rom using lunar ips [CR] (http://fusoya.panicus.org/lips/index.html) or[CR]any other ips application (this is just the one i use)[CR]-Play[CR]-NEW[CR]FEATURES-[CR]--------------------------------------------------------------[CR]-Physics[CR]Changes: Something that always bothered me has been the horribly slow falling[CR]speed in this game. [CR] Every time I jumped I felt like I was wasting time[CR]waiting to land on the ground. [CR] My reason for changing it is backed up by[CR]a Pirate data in Metroid Prime that states Zebes total [CR] mass nearly[CR]equivalent to Tallon VI. I also Favored changing the physics because in every[CR]SM [CR] hack Ive played I get bored rather quickly because I already know[CR]everything there is. I know [CR] where I can wall jump, that I can bomb jump[CR]places, that I can easily get around this place by [CR] doing another thing. I[CR]have also modified bomb jumping to return to the fast falling speeds of[CR] M1[CR]and Metroid Prime. Many tricks you knew in the original will need to be[CR]relearned which brings[CR] back that "unfamiliar" feeling of gameplay. THATS[CR]why I changed the physics.[CR]-New Items: There are 2 new major upgrades that[CR]Samus will need to complete her adventure. One of them is [CR] required, the[CR]other a simple weapons addition to enhance your fire power. Hi-Jump boots[CR]now[CR] come packaged with Spring-Ball.[CR]-Abilities: Wall jumping has become[CR]a bigger part in this hack. IF a wall is rocky and has a gripping surface[CR]then Samus will be able to wall jump off of it. However if the wall is a[CR]smooth pipe, or an algae[CR] covered seawall, then Samus wont be able to get[CR]ANY grip to jump from. A new technique that was [CR] Alien to SM has finally[CR]been added to the game as well, and youll need to use it carefully if you [CR]wish to get all 100%[CR]items.[CR]-Troubleshooting-[CR]-------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Q:[CR]I am using Zsnes and the game doesnt work/appears as a garbled mess. How do[CR] I get it to work?[CR]A: Zsnes 1.4x does not seem to support the game,[CR]however previous versions like [CR] 1.36 works, as will future versions of[CR]Zsnes.[CR]Q: I seem to be stuck in an area where it looks like I have to use[CR]the infinite [CR] bomb jump to get out, and it seems too difficult for me to[CR]do it. What do I do?[CR]A:The Infinite bomb jump is NEVER required to beat[CR]this hack, so if you find yourself doing this to get somewhere, you might want[CR]to turn around and get[CR] the item that you need. It is, however, nessicary[CR]to get 100% items. [CR]Q: Crateria seems rather dark and I cant see[CR]much.[CR]A: Adjust the settings on your monitor so its brighter. Its an[CR]obvious [CR]solution, but some people (I am looking at you, Jigglysaint) may[CR]not get it right [CR]away.[CR]Q: It burns!!!![CR]A: Just keep on[CR]running...[CR]-Credits-[CR]--------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Project[CR]Leader/Level Design: -Drewseph-[CR]Main Programmer: -Kejardon-[CR]Additional[CR]Programmers: -Jathys-[CR] -Jman2050-[CR] -MathOnNapkins-[CR]Beta Testers:[CR]-Atma-[CR] -Dart-Zaidyer-[CR] -Insom-[CR] -Interdpth-[CR] -Jigglysaint-[CR]-Jman2050-[CR]-Kejardon-[CR]--------------------------------------------------------------[CR]All[CR]trademarks and copyrights contained in this folder are owned by[CR]their[CR]respective trademark and copyright holders.

    <plot>Welcome to the Super Castlevania 4 Hard Mod. This is a complete level hack of[CR]the original game. Each level features new challenges and puzzles that will[CR]take time and out of the box thinking to overcome. The motivation was to make[CR]this game even more difficult and to have a fresh new challenge for people to[CR]sink their thumbs into. This is geared towards advanced techniques and even[CR]making glitches into interesting mechanics. The intended way to play this mod[CR]is to play it without save states. You start the game with 100 lives (99+your[CR]first life) and there are no continues. On game over you will be returned to[CR]1-1. This change is to make checkpoints more valuable. The stage passwords are[CR]left in, so feel free to practice the later levels with them, but the real[CR]challenge is start to finish with the given life pool. This mod is very hard[CR]and you will need to use the following to complete it: Damage boosts -Over[CR]pits -Through spikes/enemies 4 tile jumps -Can be hit moving or still -Simon[CR]can put his toes far over the edge and not fall off Ring glitch -Easier than[CR]you think to learn -Press jump and whip over a ring, holding whip press down,[CR]right over the top -You can also just down whip over a ring but this is more[CR]difficult Whip upgrade specifics -Long whip spawns after collecting 8 hearts[CR]-Certain parts need long whip to progress, -It is possible to have it when it[CR]is needed For experienced/master players this is beatable. For casual/novice[CR]players you should be able to make it through with save states and it will[CR]still be rewarding. You need to use xdelta to patch a US version of the game.[CR]-used xdeltaUI to make the patch Thanks to RedGuy for the editor.

    <plot>This is SMW Central's third completed collaboration hack based off of the 2015[CR]Vanilla Level Design Contest (VLDC) It contains 95 levels which you can play[CR]in any order you wish - all of them are open from the start except for the[CR]secret world, which is unlocked by completing every exit in the game (please[CR]read the included text for a few more details). Note that the hack auto-saves[CR]after each completed level, and "marks off" levels as you beat them with a[CR]check mark icon. Really good things come to those who are completionists...[CR]Enjoy![CR]Read Me:[CR]=~=~= The 8th Annual Vanilla Level Design[CR]Contest=~=~=~[CR]=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~ Collaboration Hack[CR]~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=~[CR]Thank you for downloading the 8th Annual VLDC[CR]collaboration hack![CR]*NOTE: For best results, use an accurate emulator (e.g.[CR]BSNES, SNES9X, ZMZ). You can beat the hack[CR]on ZSNES, but due to the nature[CR]of the SA-1 chip, the odd graphical flicker - or even a crash - may[CR]occur.*[CR]=============================[CR]BRIEF DESCRIPTION AND[CR]HISTORY[CR]=============================[CR]~From the desk of S.N.N.~[CR]For[CR]the past eight years, SMW Central has held a vanilla level design contest[CR]every spring. "Vanilla level design" refers to using only Lunar Magic to[CR]create your level - that is, no custom blocks, no custom sprites, and no[CR]custom code of any sort. We eventually began allowing people to use custom[CR]music since, truthfully, weve all gotten a bit sick of the original five or[CR]six tracks SMW offered, but this is not factored into their score. Once they[CR]finished designing their level, they would submit an IPS file, it would get[CR]judged + ranked, and that would be the end of it.[CR]Like last year, all of[CR]the entries were placed into one giant ROM and it was treated as a full hack.[CR]From the time of the contests conception to the point of the hacks release, it[CR]took about 4 months. Thats excellent, and Id like to thank everyone who[CR]assisted with it.[CR]The hack features 86 submitted entries, 4 switch palaces,[CR]and 4 super secret additional levels for those who can complete the whole hack[CR]and figure out the riddle. This means that there is a grand total of 94 levels[CR]and 121 exits for you to find .. which also makes this the largest Super Mario[CR]World hack released, ever. Wow! To help you track your progress, a counter is[CR]included at the top right of the map when youre standing on a level that[CR]tracks both the normal exit, secret exit (if one is present), and the Yoshi[CR]coins (if they are present in the level). The game also autosaves each time[CR]you move on the map.[CR]*NOTE: Only the normal and secret exits are required[CR]to unlock the special world. Yoshi coins are NOT required, and they do NOT do[CR]anything if you collect them all. If youre one of those crazy 100%[CR]completionists, go for it - otherwise, focus your efforts on the exits[CR]themselves.*[CR]That being said, enjoy!</plot>

    <plot>The 9th Annual Vanilla Level Design Contest Collab Hack of 2016 features 108[CR]contest submissions, along with various staff, judge, and post-game levels.[CR]There are a total of 152 exits spread across 117 levels. While the levels[CR]themselves remain vanilla, we included various other ASM features such as[CR]score displays with reset functions, as the point of this collab is showing[CR]off the individual levels, and not to be restricted by the switch palaces one[CR]has already pressed. The over-world also features ASM shenanigans en masse,[CR]creating an experience you are sure to have never had before in a Super Mario[CR]World ROM hack. Taking all of these aspects into consideration, this is now[CR]the largest SMW hack ever made (more than 96 levels that would not fit into a[CR]regular 4MB ROM!).[CR]Read Me:[CR]____ ____.____ ________ _________[CR]________ [CR]\ \ / /| | \\______ \ \\_ ___ \/ __ \\[CR] \ Y / | | | | \/ \[CR]\/\\____ /[CR] \ / | |___ | ` \ \\____ / / [CR] \\___/ |_______ \/_______[CR]/\\______ / /____/ [CR] \/ \/ \/ [CR]Thank you for downloading the 9th Annual[CR]VLDC collaboration hack![CR]A little advice upfront, this hack uses a 6MB ROM,[CR]as such, some emulators like older version of snes9x might not be able to[CR]handle it. While ZSNES can handle the ROM itself, due to the use of the SA-1[CR]chip, it might glitch or crash on random section, so wed advice against using[CR]it.[CR]================================[CR]Supporting[CR]Emulators[CR]================================[CR] snes9x 1.54[CR] zmz[CR]zsnes (with risk of sa-1 acting out I guess)[CR] bsnes 0.73[CR] higan 1.01[CR](with ocasional minor graphical[CR]glitches)[CR]================================[CR]A brief summary from[CR]Jack[CR]================================[CR]Vanilla refers to the fact that[CR]the level was made with only Lunar Magic (the SMW editing tool) and no custom[CR]code beyond that. Over the years, weve started allowing some additional things[CR]like slight graphics manipulation (overlapping, recoloring, rotating 90deg)[CR]and custom music to be added.[CR]Additionally, weve applied some custom code[CR]to fix stuff that couldnt occur in the original game (like dying in a level[CR]with 0 seconds on the timer)[CR]Like we did the past 2 years, all the levels[CR]have been combined into one gigantic hack. This year, however, is a first, as[CR]its the first time EVER that weve had more levels than what SMW can originally[CR]handle. That is to say, more than 96 levels. In total, this hack contains 108[CR]levels that were submitted as part of the contest and additional staff, judge[CR]and postgame content for a total of 117 levels and 152 exits.[CR]From the[CR]first planning discussions to the finished hack it took as 1 year to put[CR]everything together and Id like to thank everyone who put time and effort into[CR]this to finish a hack of that size in such a short amount of time.[CR]The hack[CR]features a post-game content that can be unlocked after all exits have been[CR]gotten. The Yoshi coins are not required for this. How to unlock the post-game[CR]content? Well Im sure youll figure it out ;)[CR]With that, thanks again for[CR]downloading and have fun playing with best regards from JackTheSpades and all[CR]of SMWCentral.net who helped to put this amazing hack[CR]together.[CR]================================[CR]Version[CR]History[CR]================================[CR]V1.10 - First official[CR]release[CR]v1.11 - Fixed palette in Divemissils level[CR] Fixed yellow level[CR]dot for Simple Patch[CR] Remove exit enabled pipe in LucasRCDs level[CR]Various stuff in SomeGuy712xs level[CR] Removed time limit from switch[CR]palaces.[CR] Removed F*** You from Streamside (because we cant have[CR]profanity[CR] like that on an (illegal) ROM hack on the interenet in 2016)[CR]Changed some names in the credits[CR] Fix walking on OW after beating S.N.N.s[CR]level[CR] Small changes to the haunted OW map.[CR] Fixed 3rd save slot.</plot>

    <plot>The Bob-omb Mafia has welshed out on a deal with Bowser and it is up to Mario[CR]to retrieve five of Bowser's shells from the bob-ombs. In this hack Mario-with[CR]the help of Mallow-must defeat a series of bosses including a large Thwomp,[CR]two clowns, and a forest witch, and defeat the diminutive mafia boss who is[CR]under the guard of two large bob-bombs and a vicious, bloodthirsty ant. There[CR]is also one puzzle room, as well as a few side-quests." This is a much[CR]improved version over 2.0 which itself was infinitely superior to the awful[CR]mess that was v1.0 (v1.0, I'm afraid, has permanently scarred the reputation[CR]of the hack). There are no new monsters or areas, but many changes have been[CR]made. Welcome to version 2.3 of "The Bob-omb Mafia". This new and improved[CR]version has more balanced mechanics as well as a more linear storyline.[CR]Monsters give more experience, so less "grinding" is necessary to hasten[CR]leveling up. Minor changes include slightly weaker monsters early in the game[CR]and some script mods. Also some items and treasures have been added, changed[CR]or moved around to balance the gameplay. Changes from v2.2 include a new title[CR]screen, a switch that needs to be hit in order to access Baba Yaga's room, and[CR]a minimum of 3 instead of 5 battles with Radish. In other words, this hack is[CR]both easier to play and faster to complete. The player will not have to guess[CR]what must be done next, because v2.2 places roadblocks to certain areas as a[CR]means of guiding them to where they need to go next (ie. a more linear[CR]storyline). Certain items must be acquired to enter new areas, and the[CR]difficulty of the monsters in these areas should reflect the player's current[CR]level. The final boss, however, is of the same level of difficulty as in v2.0[CR]but still not impossible (in fact, quite easy with enough Bane Bombs, Ice[CR]Bombs, Red Essences and Power Blasts). Some item rewards have been switched[CR]around and/or changed as a way to sustain a balanced level of difficulty. A[CR]couple of items were added to the town shop, and two bugs I noticed in v2.0[CR]were fixed: you can no longer run away from the green/blue wigglers, and you[CR]cannot skip the radish by jumping over it using a flashing dog as a platform.[CR]This hack also includes tile and solidity mods in the main town area for the[CR]three locked doors. That means the mod feature in Lazy Shell works without[CR]crashing. The new version of this hack has all (presumably) bugs fixed, usage[CR]of world maps, new bosses, better strategy, two new spells, several new[CR]attacks, more organized and balanced gameplay, a more linear storyline, easier[CR]early battles, and faster leveling up. FEATURES: * 35 entirely new levels *[CR]50+ new overworld events * 100+ new dialogues * 12 new bosses * several new[CR]items * 2 new spell animations * actual game strategy This hack most[CR]predominantly demonstrates the capabilities of the level editor and event[CR]script editor portions of the editor.[CR]Read[CR]Me:[CR]______________________________________________________________________[CR]DESCRIPTION[CR]______________________________________________________________________[CR]"The[CR]Bob-omb Mafia has welshed out on a deal with Bowser and it is up [CR] to Mario[CR]to retrieve five of Bowsers shells from the bob-ombs.

Game[CR]Basics[CR]/__\/__\=======================================================================[CR]-------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]I-1.[CR]Introduction[CR]-------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]* Are you ready for a brand new adventure?[CR] * Are you ready to play a whole[CR]new zelda 3 game, with completely new [CR] dungeons and overworlds?[CR] * Are[CR]you ready to find the secrets of the Parallel Worlds?[CR]Parallel Worlds is a[CR]fully hacked version of Zelda 3 (aka A Link to the Past).[CR]A majority of the[CR]game has been changed. There may be a few rooms which can be [CR]said to be[CR]similar to some from the original game.[CR]General changes involve:[CR] *[CR]Brand new Overworlds, I promise you wont find an area which is unchanged![CR]* Brand new Dungeons, all dungeons are completely different from the[CR]original![CR] * New house indoors and caves, some of these you may find[CR]similar to the [CR] original game.[CR] * New Graphics, a lot of the graphics[CR]have been changed.[CR] * New Screen layout, similar to Ocarina of Time yet not[CR]exactly the same.[CR] * Some new music, the original game had great music,[CR]these are not to be [CR] changed :)[CR] * New Story, while some maybe similar[CR]to the original game, but [CR] its intentional.[CR] * A lot of other changes,[CR]and surprises! [CR]This is a result of 4 years (maybe 5) of "behind the[CR]scenes" hard work, lots [CR]of assembly hacks and fixes etc. This game was[CR]known as Tower of the Triforce [CR]which some people may remember, when I[CR]released a demo from that game a few [CR]years ago. When SePH joined the team[CR]a majority of the things from that hack [CR]was taken over into this hack, so[CR]spiritually its still the Tower of the [CR]Triforce (to me that is).[CR]This[CR]game is difficult. Believe me when I say it is. Youll need to have every[CR]trick from the original game memorized plus more to beat this.[CR]Puzzles[CR]are everywhere in this game. Some dungeons are more puzzle oriented, [CR]while[CR]some dungeons are more fighting oriented. I try to keep a balance [CR]between[CR]the two in some dungeons.[CR]While there isnt much enemy changes, there are a[CR]few, which Ill let the [CR]player find out by themselves.[CR]There is tons of[CR]secrets in this game... some are original while some are just [CR]brought over[CR]from other zelda games.[CR]Thats it for a brief introduction... we hope you[CR]enjoy playing this game![CR]-------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]I-2. Patching the[CR]game[CR]-------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]First[CR]things first, to play Zelda Parallel Worlds you will need:[CR]1. The included[CR]patch[CR]2. A patching program such as beat or Floating IPS[CR]3. A copy of[CR]Zelda A Link To The Past (U) WITHOUT A HEADER[CR] (Dont bother asking for the[CR]rom!)[CR]4. Other useful Information:[CR] CRC32: 7A569B88 (only if you hard[CR]patch the rom)[CR] Patched Size: 1.5MB (1,572,864 bytes)[CR]You can find a[CR]guide on how to use LIPS at[CR]romhacking[dot]net[CR]-------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]I-3. Story[CR](Prelude)[CR]-------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Please[CR]note:[CR] **This games story is not based on any official Zelda games**[CR]You[CR]are a treasure hunter from another land. You moved here with your friend,[CR]in order to find treasure of course![CR]A lot of things started to happen[CR]not long after you moved here.[CR]Seven people has "appeared out of nowhere"[CR]and beings questioning about the [CR]Parallel Tower and the inhabitants of[CR]Kakariko Village. The Parallel Tower was [CR]situated in the Sky Islands[CR]northeast of the village. The legend behind the [CR]Parallel Tower was long[CR]lost, and only the elders knew the legend.[CR]Word begin to spread out about[CR]the Parallel Tower, and people started to learn [CR]about the legend again.[CR]The legend says it was a byproduct of a war long ago [CR]and a power, known as[CR]the Triforce, existed at the top of it. It is said that [CR]nobody knows about[CR]the clues as to how to get to the top of the Tower. The [CR]seven people are[CR]said to know about these "clues" to the Tower.[CR]The king was notified of[CR]these seven people and he invited them to the castle [CR]to find out what they[CR]wanted with the tower. Just the night before the seven [CR]people are to have[CR]an audience with the king, the kings assistant, Draegor, [CR]eliminates the[CR]king and claims the throne by default.[CR]The seven people walked right into[CR]an obvious trap. Draegor, who people believe[CR]is a power hungry person,[CR]caught all 7 people and forces them to tell him what [CR]they know about the[CR]Tower.[CR]When the people learnt of the kings fate, a rebel force is gathered[CR]in secret [CR]to plot against Draegor. The rebel force learnt that 2 out of 7[CR]people which [CR]Draegor caught are still alive and imprisoned in the[CR]guardhouse. They quickly [CR]rallied anyone who may be interested in the Tower[CR]and the locals to help these [CR]last 2 people.[CR]You and your friend heard[CR]about this plan and are willing help the rebels [CR]against Draegor.[CR]The[CR]night of the operation begins the[CR]story...[CR]-------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]I-4.[CR]Features[CR]-------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]For[CR]detailed changes and screenshots of the game hud and various other[CR]things,[CR]I suggest you refer to the html version of this readme.[CR] /\\[CR]/__\=========================================================================[CR]/\ /\ II. Brief Walkthrough *SPOILERS[CR]AHEAD!*[CR]/__\/__\=======================================================================[CR]This part of the readme contains information on how to get past the[CR]introduction sequence. Since it can be quite hard, especially for[CR]beginners, [CR]we decided to include a brief walkthrough of it in the readme.[CR]Thus if you [CR]wouldnt like to be spoiled, you might want to skip this part[CR]of the reading.[CR] **The names of the areas/places are in the[CR]brackets.**[CR]Of course, if you have any more questions or comments you can[CR]always leave a [CR]message in the thread or an email at:[CR]tac_seph[at]hotmail[dot]com[CR]Anyways,[CR]enjoy![CR]-------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]II-1. Hyrule Field and Caves[CR]system[CR]-------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR][House[CR]Interior][CR]Once youre told of the beginning interlude, head[CR]outside.[CR][Your House][CR]From here on, you could go to the beach in the[CR]west but the area is pretty [CR]much closed down for now, so instead, head[CR]north.[CR][Village Entrance][CR]Guards are blocking the way to the right path[CR](which leads to the Misty woods).[CR]So that leaves you no choice but to keep[CR]going north.[CR][Kakariko Village][CR]Ah! Looks like theres guards everywhere,[CR]sounds like you cant wander around [CR]too much either. Theres a large cave[CR]surrounded by shallow water. Notice its[CR]emplacement for now but dont enter[CR]it just yet (Its dark inside). Enter the[CR]right entrance of the twin house[CR]to get some bombs inside the pots. You might[CR]want to refill as needed.[CR]Eventually youll be able to buy them too. Back in[CR]the village, head to the[CR]east area.[CR][Village Cemetery][CR]Still more guards blocking places and[CR]sentries around, you find yourself very[CR]close to the church. Follow the[CR]path to the east until you see two paths. One[CR]heading northeast and the[CR]other southeast. Take the north one while beeing[CR]cautious of the guard that[CR]can attack you here.[CR][Church path][CR]Theres a cave south of here, but dont[CR]jump there for now, instead follow the[CR]brown path until you find tall[CR]grass. Keep going north. [CR][Village Church][CR]Cross the north bridge and[CR]atop the stairs youll find the church where [CR]villagers gather to pray at[CR]times. Enter it. Inside, examine the top of the[CR]right stairs. Youll find an[CR]heart container inside a chest![CR]Now go back outside, then head into that[CR]cave in the church path which I [CR]mentioned earlier.[CR][Hyrulian Cave[CR]System][CR]When you enter the cave youll notice a fake shooter there. Nothing[CR]impressive.[CR]Proceed to the next room... here, quickly make your way to the[CR]left before[CR]the Armos knight wakes up. In the next room, make haste to the[CR]south room [CR]before the shooter starts shooting at you. Head south in the[CR]next big room,[CR]until you come across some pots. Take one of them and kill[CR]the bat in your way,[CR]take another one and head west *Dont jump below just[CR]yet* and kill the other [CR]bat next to the chest. Now you may claim its[CR]content! Youll get the lamp![CR]You can now jump down to the south and[CR]exit.[CR]Now its time to head for the guardhouse. Well hidden near the castle,[CR]its [CR]where most of the guards gather during patrol duties and also where[CR]the main [CR]prison lies.[CR]Remember that large cave I introduced in Kakariko[CR]Village? Now that youve got [CR]something to light your way, its time to go[CR]there again![CR][Secret Waterway][CR]Inside go to the left, picking up those[CR]valuable blue rupees on your way and [CR]then head north. In the next room[CR]youll see a hole, jump in it to find[CR]yourself on the bottom floor. First,[CR]light the torch so that you see something, [CR]then head east. Now theres an[CR]enemy which blocks your way south. If you think[CR]you can avoid it, then go[CR]for it, otherwise take one of the pots in the north[CR]part of this room to[CR]quickly get rid of it. Then proceed to the south exit.[CR][Lupo[CR]Intersection][CR]Dont waste your time here, avoid the monsters and enter the[CR]west cave [CR]surrounded by the torches you see.[CR][Ancient Tunnels][CR]Here[CR]lies the ancient catacombs tunnels used by the village ancestors as a [CR]way[CR]to quickly move between places. Now its mostly stuffed up by traps[CR]and[CR]holes left by the time. [CR]**You might want to save your progress to[CR]this point if you dont want to restart[CR]your game from the start. You get[CR]your sword very late in the guardhouse and [CR]hence if you dont have it and[CR]die youll start again in your house (That can be[CR]annoying for some people).[CR]Youre warned!**[CR]Inside, take the right door. By being cautious of the[CR]shooter, pickup the blue [CR]rupees then proceed north. Looks like someone was[CR]here before you, the content[CR]of the chests were all stolen already. Head[CR]right. In the next room lies the[CR]most challenging part of the intro,[CR]getting around the pits of doom labyrinth[CR]that is. The problem lies with[CR]the fact that there will have plenty of shooters[CR]in your way, firing at[CR]random, so its a pretty tedious part at first but once [CR]you know a way, its[CR]pretty easy actually. When youre done, take the exit and[CR]prepare to claim[CR]your first sword and shield![CR]**Again, for beginners, using savestates here[CR]is the key to get through it.**[CR][Castle Guardhouse][CR]Move south[CR]carefully, and make haste to the doorway of the guardhouse before [CR]the[CR]sentry guard catches you. Congratulations youve made it alive to the[CR]guardhouse. Now comes the infiltration[CR]part![CR]-------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]II-2. Sneaking into the[CR]guardhouse[CR]-------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Once[CR]youve made step into the guardhouse, three paths opens for you to go. [CR]One[CR]needs a key and the other you need to activate a switch. For now head west.[CR]Follow the path through the rooms until you descend stairs. Youll find[CR]yourself in the wine cellar. Theres a small key and a big door. Take the[CR]small[CR]key and head back to the entrance. Now, active the switch near the[CR]north door [CR]and then head east. Continue walking through the doors till you[CR]end up in a [CR]room full of bookcases. Activate the switch on the floor and[CR]go to the next [CR]room. Bottom of the stairs, theres four pots and a big[CR]chest. Since you dont[CR]have the big chest key, lets just pick up the pots to[CR]find a key. You may now[CR]go back to the entrance.[CR]Now that youve got two[CR]keys, use one of them to open the north door and again[CR]follow that path[CR]until you descend the stairs. When you arrive at B1 youll [CR]know that the[CR]next few rooms of the guardhouse will have plenty of locked [CR]doors and[CR]switches on the floor. Just follow the path you see and youll [CR]eventually[CR]find stairs which leads to B2 in the interrogation room where is [CR]held your[CR]friend you see in the beginning. Head to the west room and down the[CR]stairs. Youll end up in the prison upper floor. Go west, walk past the[CR]dangerous soldiers there and down the stairs again. The prison lower floor[CR]is[CR]just ahead. Now move to the room just above you, and then quickly move[CR]the [CR]middleand head south, now walk past the guard there and finally go up[CR]again. [CR]Head east. Here lies the prison wardens room. The soldier here has[CR]one of [CR]the keys to get to your friend but you dont have anything to fight[CR]him yet,[CR]so just move to the next room for now.[CR]For the next two rooms,[CR]just head south, walking past your enemies then youll[CR]encounter a blue[CR]soldier in front of you. Quickly head east before he catches [CR]you. You walk[CR]past an heart pie but you need the hookshot to get there, so [CR]forget it for[CR]now. Just go to the next room. Youll get locked in and will [CR]have to dodge[CR]the floor tiles. When its opened, head north and use your key[CR]on the[CR]remaining locked door. Inside youll find the big key in a chest [CR]surrounded[CR]by spikes. Now that you have that key you can go back all the way[CR]up to the[CR]wine cellar near the entrance.[CR]Once youre there, head for the locked door.[CR]Once its opened, in the next[CR]room youll see lots of soldiers, head right[CR]and somewhere south of the bar, [CR]theres a switch for the locked door youll[CR]see. Open it and get the key [CR]inside. You may now return to the[CR]interrogation floor, somewhere on that floor[CR]you can use your big key in a[CR]cell. Once its done, in the next room you [CR]should see a locked door. Use[CR]your small key and finally the other side [CR]youll get your sword and shield![CR]Now youre missing one more key. Head to[CR]the prison wardens room and kill[CR]the soldier there. Youll find a key on [CR]his corpse.[CR]Its time to go save[CR]Zelda. Go to the prison upper floor in the room with the[CR]stairs to go up.[CR]Now head into the room to the right (which you havent go to[CR]yet). Kill[CR]everyone in the room to open the locked door. In the next room,[CR]open the[CR]door with your remaining key and inside lies Zelda. Heard her short[CR] story[CR]then finally head to the wine cellar once again. Inside, move the top[CR] of[CR]the room hidden passage. This concludes the walkthrough for the[CR]guardhouse![CR]Now its time to escape through the[CR]sewers...[CR]-------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]II-3. The guardhouse[CR]escape[CR]-------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR][Cellar[CR]Passage][CR]To the right of the door theres a chest but since it requires the[CR]big chest[CR]key, which you dont have youll have to take the left path. Move[CR]along the [CR]doors until you descend stairs.[CR][Guardhouse Sewers][CR]Here,[CR]theres no straight path to chose, but remember that the exit is[CR]somewhere[CR]east from where you enter. Once youve it through the maze youll[CR]end up in a[CR]small room full of holes, switches and rats. The correct switch[CR]to open the[CR]north door is the one between the two small holes near the [CR]entrance. Move[CR]the north room once youve walked on the switch. In the next[CR]small room[CR]theres a labyrinth. Find the way out and head up the stairs.[CR][Church[CR]passage][CR]Head south and follow the pretty straight forward path which lies[CR]before you.[CR]When you encounter stairs, take them to find yourself near a[CR]maze of pegs.[CR]Follow where it goes and eventually youll have the choice of[CR]either going up[CR]the stairs or hitting a peg switch. Do the later, theres no[CR]point going up[CR]just yet. Follow the newly formed ways you can go to and[CR]youll eventually[CR]see the stairs to go below. Take them and just north of[CR]them lies another set[CR]of stairs. Head into the maze and north of there lies[CR]stairs to move to the[CR]churchs back room. On the floor above, you should see[CR]a chest. Take it, it [CR]contains the big chest key of this level.[CR]Now[CR]youve got to go back to the cellar passage and get the chest which[CR]youve[CR]previously missed on. Once you arrive, open it to get the blue[CR]boomerang. Now[CR]that you have it you may return to the church passage. Make[CR]sure the blue pegs [CR]are on and the red ones are off. Make it all the way up[CR]to the church back [CR]room using the other set of stairs which you havent[CR]used yet. Now just move[CR]below and using your boomerang hit the peg switch[CR]while moving right. [CR]Eventually youll be able to go in the next room just[CR]below. Hit the left [CR]switch and youll make it into the[CR]church![CR]-------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]II-4.

Frequently Asked[CR]Questions[CR]/__\/__\=======================================================================[CR]This[CR]section will expand as questions keep coming.[CR]Q: I have found the big key,[CR]but the big chest in the guardhouse doesnt open![CR]A: If you havent noticed[CR]yet, this game doesnt use either maps or compass in [CR]the dungeons. Instead,[CR]we used our creative talents to make two new distinctive[CR]items for you to[CR]get. The big chest key and the big door key! That means if you[CR]want that[CR]chest to open, you need to find the proper key.[CR]Q: Whats the purpose of the[CR]mysterious tablets?[CR]A: It is a secret to everybody.[CR]Q: Im lost, I dont[CR]know where to go next![CR]A: Look around, most of the story was changed and so[CR]is the monologue so talk[CR]to all the people you encounter.

    <plot>Parallel Remodel is a remodeled version of the famous Zelda3 hack Parallel[CR]Worlds, that we all know as an extremely difficult game. Parallel Worlds is[CR]altogether a great technological marvel, with new gfx, various asm patches,[CR]completely new overworld and dungeons etc. It has the potential of being even[CR]better than Alttp, but the gameplay is somewhat too radical. The backtracking[CR]was (in not so rare occasions) escalated to the extreme, the same goes for the[CR]health of some enemies. Some intellectual problems in the dark world dungeons[CR]are algorithm marvels: sure this is a good thing for math (Euclid really fits[CR]his nickname), but this is not a good thing for the player, who can easily[CR]give up. Thus the idea of a remodel was born and was approved by SePH.[CR]Parallel Remodel therefore brings the difficulty to normal: backtracking was[CR]reduced almost to zero, algorithm problems were replaced, various semi bosses[CR]were reduced, special stunts like bomb jumping etc were removed, dark rooms[CR]are now lit etc. Parallel Remodel is a game that's fair to the player and[CR]doesn't want to force any super tricks, stunts or logic to finish the game,[CR]while still having a decent difficulty. It makes Parallel Worlds enjoyable.[CR]You don't have to use save states or cheats to finish the game. You don't have[CR]to be a veteran or a super player either. You will not be frustrated while[CR]playing. Parallel Remodel recreates Parallel Worlds according to the 6 years[CR]of revisions from players all over the globe. It is suitable for beginners and[CR]veterans, for those who have failed at Parallel Worlds and for those who have[CR]finished it, since this game is a lot more than just a plain reduction of[CR]sprites.[CR]Read Me:[CR] 0[CR] 000[CR] 00000[CR] 0000000[CR]000000000[CR] 00000000000[CR] 0000000000000[CR] 000000000000000[CR]00000000000000000[CR] 0 0[CR] 000 000[CR] 00000 00000[CR] 0000000 0000000[CR]000000000 000000000[CR] 00000000000 00000000000[CR] 0000000000000[CR]0000000000000[CR] 000000000000000 000000000000000[CR] 00000000000000000[CR]00000000000000000[CR] 0000000000000000000000000000000000000[CR] The Legend of[CR]Zelda[CR] Parallel Remodel v1-1[CR] Original game[CR] The Legend of Zelda[CR]A Link to the Past[CR] developed and published by Nintendo[CR] for the Super[CR]Nintendo, 1991-1992[CR] Original Rom Info![CR] Name: Legend of Zelda, The - A[CR]Link to the Past (U) [!][CR] No Header[CR] Date of last change: August 23rd[CR]2004[CR] Size: 1.024 KB[CR] This is the US rom, dont patch to other roms![CR]Original Hack Parallel Worlds by Euclid and SePH (2006)[CR] Remodel by[CR]PuzzleDude (2012)[CR] Version 1-1, August 9 th, 2012[CR] /\\[CR]/__\=========================================================================[CR]/\ /\ NEW IN VERSION[CR]1-1[CR]/__\/__\=======================================================================[CR]1.[CR]In comparisment to 1-0 the Texts have been updated, since the 1-0 had the old[CR]texts from[CR] PW 1-0.

The fire dance of four shall move the stony wall.[CR] Refers to[CR]the 4 torches, that must be lit in order to proceed.[CR]3.

Remaining[CR]problems:[CR]1. Links sprite can be displayed darker, or with false palette of[CR]the face.[CR] The problem is triggered by ether medallion, electric shock and[CR]both bracelets.[CR]2. Some jumps down the hill can lead to a bug state (very[CR]rare).[CR]3. Dark world Church area (dont go left).

This quest was also remodeled,[CR]since[CR]the original was quite confusing (you could enter all dungeons, but[CR]couldnt finish them).[CR]The unlocked secret can be quite confusing. It says:[CR]enter TotT. This means instead of your[CR]name at the beginning of the game,[CR]you must enter TotT and the game will be different and[CR]shorter (different[CR]ending and some other minor things).[CR] /\\[CR]/__\=========================================================================[CR]/\ /\ HOW TO PLAY (IPS[CR]PATCHING)[CR]/__\/__\=======================================================================[CR]1.[CR]You must have the original rom Zelda A Link to the past.

Google those[CR]emulators and download them. Then choose load game (and[CR]select the patched smc, Not ips).[CR]Note: Other emulators like SNES emulators[CR]for Wii or DS, are NOT recommended and are NOT[CR]compatible with this game.[CR]They dont emulate the way they should.

Do the patching[CR]yourself and get roms or emus yourself,[CR]since nobody can legaly get it for[CR]you. Thus Dont ask us for a rom, original or[CR]modified.[CR]Not to mention[CR]the selling of the snes cartridges with our modified games. This is[CR]not[CR]only against the law, but you are also earning money while breaking the[CR]law. You are[CR]breaking it twice. Moding is on a non-solid ground as it is.[CR]By those kind of actions[CR]you only prove that Nintendos statements are just.[CR]If you continue doing this, they might[CR]also ban ips files, closing the[CR]moding altogether.[CR]Note, this IPS file is a freeware and should not be sold[CR]to anyone. It is meant to be used[CR]by private individuals and it is not[CR]meant to be redistributed, certainly not in a [CR]combination with any isos,[CR]emus or roms; original or patched, digital or on a cart.</plot>

The hack is about 95% the same, but[CR]the changes generally make things more difficult.

Mario's only[CR]chance to stop Zycloboo is to find the Power Supply station, which can give[CR]him the power he needs for the task - or at least that's what Zycloboo told[CR]him, heeheehee! About the game: The levels for itself are most of the time[CR]very "big" compared to the typical SMW-level. From the length, they have more[CR]of a Yoshi's Island-level. You can find a lot of hidden stuff here and there,[CR]dozens of bonus rooms and so on. There are also a few levels, where you can go[CR]different roads. Sometimes, the second route is more hidden and harder to[CR]beat, but it will lead to a secret exit. There are a lot puzzles in the hack[CR]as well, but with one major exception near the end of the game they aren't on[CR]the normal route, which means the secret levels are usually more puzzling than[CR]the normal ones, but very often they are also more "special". Unlike my first[CR]hack, this time it's not necessary to find all the hidden Switch Palaces to[CR]beat the final boss, but it could be helpful to find them nevertheless. If you[CR]stay just on the normal route (without finding any secret exit) you can[CR]complete the game after 55 levels. But in that case, you would leave out 36[CR]additional levels. You see, there is much to explore. ;) About the worlds...[CR]nothing outstanding here: World 1 is the typical grassland- World, World 2 is[CR]the typical Forest-World, World 3 is the Beach and the Desert, World 4 and 5[CR]aren't really themed. Here you can find Ice-, Canyon-, Cheese-level and[CR]whatever. World 6 is the Venom Underground World, which contains some of the[CR]first levels I did for this hack. World 7 is the typical futuristic Base-[CR]World, with some underground parts (World 7 covers two submaps).[CR]Read[CR]Me:[CR]Super Mario World:[CR]The Second Reality Project 2 - Zycloboos[CR]Challenge[CR]Version[CR]1.2[CR]----------------------------------------------------[CR]Bugfixes in[CR]version 1.2:[CR]-I set up the right sprite mode for the intro level. In the[CR]previous versions, Zycloboos second hand showed up over his body, but it[CR]should be behind his body, like it is now.[CR]-I fixed some issues in the[CR]level "Hotel Horror". The keys and the locked doors are gone, because it[CR]happened some time, that they just arent working right, and I dont want that[CR]in the hack.[CR]Bugfixes in Version 1.1:[CR]-There was a glitch in the[CR]Midnight Canyon-level, so there was no way of ending it. It works[CR]now...[CR]Important: This hack will not work right on ZSNES 1.42! But older[CR]versions like Version 1.36 and the newest Version 1.50 should[CR]work![CR]----------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]So,[CR]this is it. After 4 years in the making, its finally completed. This hack[CR]contains 91 long and challenging, sometimes puzzling levels, and there are 109[CR]exits to find.[CR]Storyline:[CR]A One-Eyed Big Boo called Zycloboo wants to[CR]conquer the Mushroom Kingdom, and like Bowser in "The Second Reality Project[CR]1" he wants to use the power source from another dimension called the Second[CR]Reality to get to his goal.

You see, there is much to explore. ;)[CR]About[CR]the worlds... nothing outstanding here:[CR]World 1 is the typical grassland-[CR]World,[CR]World 2 is the typical Forest-World,[CR]World 3 is the Beach and the[CR]Desert,[CR]World 4 and 5 arent really themed. Here you can find Ice-, Canyon-,[CR]Cheese-level and whatever.[CR]World 6 is the Venom Underground World, which[CR]contains some of the first levels I did for this hack. [CR]World 7 is the[CR]typical futuristic Base-World, with some underground parts (World 7 covers two[CR]submaps).[CR]Some other things you should know...[CR]I know that I have quite[CR]a few different graphic styles in the hack. I wouldnt do it this way, if I[CR]would start a hack today, but what done is, is done, and frankly I dont care[CR]that much about that. I really enjoyed taking the GFX from some of my alltime-[CR]favourites and creating some levels with that, so it doesnt bother me much.[CR]^^[CR]Maybe you know my first hack, and if yes, you already know that I like[CR]long and challenging levels. The difficulty-level in this hack is almost the[CR]same as in the first one, I would say, but Im not very sure about that.But I[CR]think, everything is possible here, even without savestates (But its nothing[CR]wrong to use them, since the levels are very long - too bad, that you can only[CR]have one midway point, that really sucks). So, if you like to simply run from[CR]the left to the right in some short levels to beat the game after one day of[CR]playing, thats definetely not the right hack for you. This one needs time if[CR]you want to find everything. ;)[CR]----------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]About[CR]glitches/bugs in this hack:[CR]-There arent that much glitches in the hack (I[CR]think), the only problem that appears here are and there in some levels are[CR]related to the palette and the colors, so that means sometimes the colors[CR]arent fading all to black at the level-end or in some few cases the status-bar[CR]have different colors than usual... and something like that, nothing major, it[CR]doesnt affect any gameplay.[CR]-After youve found 99 exits, the title screen[CR]will say A0 instead of 100. This will continue in this way until you reach the[CR]highest amount of exits, which is 109.[CR]-In addition, there are small[CR]troubles with the end credits. Besides a short "Lose a life"-single at the[CR]beginning there is no music during the credits. The end credits-sequence is[CR]flickering a little bit, but only on ZSNES, for whatever reason, but its[CR]nothing major either. And, after the Yoshi-hatch-sequence the sequence fades[CR]to black in a very weird way, and after that the game will end, there is no[CR]"Cast"-sequence[CR]anymore.[CR]----------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Last[CR]but not least I wish to thank a few people who helped me out a lot in the last[CR]4 years:[CR]-First, FuSoYa. Without Lunar Magic, I would have never been able[CR]to hack this game.[CR]-jonwil, because of Block Tool of course, but not only[CR]because of that. He offered me some help with my hack some time ago, and since[CR]I couldnt get the ON/OFF-controlled blocks in my hack (it was much harder to[CR]do that these days) I asked him, if he could help me with that, and so he[CR]inserted the blocks for me. Many thanks![CR]-Bouche, of course, since this[CR]hack is based on Demo World 3 because of the different music. Normally I[CR]prefer the SMW-music, but since my first hack already had the SMW-music I[CR]decided to use the Demo World 3-hack for some variety.[CR]-Devin432. Some time[CR]ago this guy created a block which could be destroyed by throwing a goomba at[CR]it. Later, I replaced the block with the "Sprite Smashable brick", but I want[CR]to thank him nevertheless, because he was the first at the time who created a[CR]block like this.[CR]-Surlent, he helped me understanding Block Tool a very[CR]long time ago, hehe. ^^[CR]-Smallhacker, for the Status Bar editor. I did[CR]nothing special with the Status Bar (because I think it is good in its current[CR]form), but I changed some minor details to make some palette-problems with the[CR]Status-Bar easier fixable.[CR]-Glyph Phoenix, for his "Counter Break Y"-patch.[CR]He created the "Counter Break"-patch a while ago, this patch resets Yoshi[CR]status, powerup status, item box status, and coin status every time you change[CR]levels. I asked him, if he could create a patch, which only resets the Yoshi-[CR]status (so you cant go with him in different levels) and he was kindly enough[CR]to help me out with that![CR]-icegoom, he created a special sprite-GFX for[CR]me... for which sprite... I dont tell, lol.[CR]-mikeyk, he created Sprite[CR]Tool, and besides that he fullfilled a request of mine and created a friendly[CR]Mega-Mole-sprite for this hack.[CR]-Davros, he created the "Normal[CR]shooter"-sprite.[CR]-BMF54123, he helped me out a lot with creating the[CR]"Slowdown-fix", because this was something this hack really needed. Thanks to[CR]a lot custom blocks, the slowdown in some level areas was almost intolerable,[CR]so Im very glad that I was finally able to get rid of the slowdown-problem.[CR]BMF54123 did also the "Fade-Fix"-patch, which Im also using in this[CR]hack.[CR]In addition I would like to thank all the people on AcmIns Board, who[CR]helped and supported me as well. Without all your help this hack would not be[CR]what it is right now.[CR]I would also like to thank Nintendo for[CR]Mario,[CR]Sega for Sonic,[CR]HAL for Kirby,[CR]Mindscape for Alfred[CR]Chicken[CR]and Sunsoft for creating the allmighty Powercats without knowing[CR]it,[CR]lol.[CR]----------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]And[CR]now, [CR]enjoy the hack... ;)[CR]FPI Productions[CR]2002-2006[CR]www.fpi-[CR]productions.de</plot>

    <plot>Background information: So, what's this all about? "The Second Reality Project[CR]Reloaded" is not another new entry in the TSRP-series, it's a remake of the[CR]first part. The hack finally features a new overworld (people requested this[CR]for years) and of course, custom graphics and custom music. Besides that, not[CR]much have changed, most of the time the level design is the same as before.[CR]So, keep in mind that the original hack came out back in 2002, and back in the[CR]days you don't had the possibility to insert custom sprites, dozens of ASM-[CR]hacks and so on. So please don't expect anything groundbreaking here, it's[CR]still the same thing as it was before: a hack which is about level design and[CR]nothing else. But with that said, chances are if you enjoyed the original[CR]hack, you will love the remake for sure! Storyline: Bowser is back again, more[CR]powerful than times ago: He found a power source which let him rebuilt his[CR]Airship Fleet. Soon he plans on attacking the Mushroom Kingdom one time more![CR]It's up to Mario to stop him! Note: This hack will not work right on ZSNES[CR]1.4*. Just use an older or newer version instead![CR]Read Me:[CR]Super[CR]Mario World:[CR]The Second Reality Project Reloaded[CR]Version[CR]1.2[CR]------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Thats[CR]it.[CR]First of all, in case you dont know, this hack isnt a complete new[CR]entry in the TSRP-series, its a remake of the first part, which means if youve[CR]already played the original hack of 2002 or the easier version which came out[CR]2004, theres not much new here. When it comes down to the leveldesign, I stay[CR]really close to the original hack, so nothing new here. Of course, the[CR]overworld design is completely redone (people requested this for years by now)[CR]and all the levels feature shiny new custom graphics. With that, the hack may[CR]look new, but it doesnt feature any "new" gimmicks, puzzles, custom sprites or[CR]incredible ASM-additions which you might expect in todays hacks. Its basically[CR]still the same thing which came out 2002. If youre fine with that, Im sure you[CR]will like this[CR]one.[CR]------------------------------------------------------------[CR]About[CR]the difficulty level:[CR]Besides the fact that this hack starts way easier[CR]than TSRP2 (which started already somewhat hardish) most people consider TSRP1[CR]harder than TSRP2, mostly because some of the last levels are almost[CR]impossible to beat without abusing save states. Thats the reason I released[CR]the easier version back in 2004, and overall this remake is based on the[CR]easier version. Still, there are a few changes (again):[CR] Almost all levels[CR]feature midway points now, some other parts were also slightly changed to make[CR]the game [CR]easier, but some other parts are made harder. [CR]A good example[CR]for this would be the level "Ice Bomb Bridge". In the easier version of TSRP,[CR]this level was called "Bob-Omb Bridge", because the ice (and the slippery) was[CR]removed to make this level easier. Now in this remake the "Ice Bomb Bridge" is[CR]back again, mostly because I thought removing the slippery ruined the charme[CR]of the level (at least for me). So lets say that this remake ranges somewhere[CR]between the original and the easier version of TSRP when it comes to the[CR]difficulty, which means it starts very easy and ends up very[CR]hard...[CR]------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Known[CR]bugs/glitches:[CR]-After youve found 99 exits, the Title Screen will display[CR]A0 instead of 100. It goes on this way unless you found all exits in the game,[CR]which are 117.[CR]-This hack will most likely not work right in ZSNES 1.4*.[CR]Make sure you have an older or newer version and you shouldnt have any[CR]problems.[CR]Fix in v1.2:[CR]-The hack doesnt crash on accurate emulators/real[CR]hardware anymore. Very special thanks goes to Ice Man who fixed this[CR]glitch.[CR]Fixes in v1.1:[CR]-Several grammar mistakes have been[CR]fixed.[CR]-The "Bonus Game"-glitch in "Yoshis Final Flight" is[CR]fixed.[CR]-Bowsers Palace on the overworld isnt cut off[CR]anymore...[CR]------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Special[CR]Thanks goes to the following people. Without their great help, this hack[CR]wouldnt be what it is right now:[CR]-AxemJinx, for his incredible help on[CR]checking out (and rewriting) all the ingame-text to get the engrish out of it.[CR]He also came up with some of the level-names. And, last but not least, he made[CR]a very thorough beta-test.[CR]-smkdan, ghettoyouth, Schwa, Mi0r and[CR]pikaguy900, who all helped me a great deal with some personal requests when it[CR]comes to custom blocks, custom sprites, and other ASM-code.[CR]-S.N.N., for[CR]his advice on the music and most importantly for one of the custom music[CR]tracks in this hack.[CR]-icegoom and ibz10g, who made most of the graphics I[CR]use for all the sprites and some objects.[CR]-anonimato, who made parts of the[CR]redrawn castle GFX Im using in some of the castle levels.[CR]-Pac, he made the[CR]animated rain.[CR]-Matrizzle, maro!!!, Davros and Dispari Scuro, who are also[CR]responsible for custom sprites and custom blocks.[CR]-jonwil, for Block tool,[CR]and some of the blocks of course.[CR]-mikeyk, for Sprite Tool, and some of the[CR]sprites.[CR]-FuSoYa, for obvious reasons... he made Lunar Magic...[CR]-Biene,[CR]for additional beta-testing.[CR]-BMF54123, for various fixes/patches.[CR]-Ice[CR]Man, for his help with the HDMA kit.[CR]-d4s, for making the HDMA[CR]kit.[CR]-Smallhacker, for Sprite Paint.[CR]-purplebridge001, he made the[CR]classic fireball patch.[CR]-Glyph Phoenix, he made the Counter Break Y[CR]patch.[CR](That should be it. I hope I didnt forget anyone)[CR]Overall, thanks[CR]goes to SMW central as well, of course.[CR]^^[CR]------------------------------------------------------------[CR]And now,[CR]enjoy the hack... ;)[CR]FPI Productions[CR]2002, 2007-2008[CR]www.fpi-[CR]productions.de</plot>

    <plot>What started as a small 'edit' that was for the sake of practicing Lunar[CR]Magic, turned into a full length hack. These levels will definitely entertain[CR]you, and they are well put together. Story- Bowser has tricked Mario into[CR]getting inside of a very strange glass box, called The Unworld. It is a very[CR]strange world in there... Mario, inside, asks you to help get him out of there[CR]using the controller connected to the box. It is up to you to lead Mario out[CR]of the Unworld and back to the real world in time to stop Bowser! Expect some[CR]humorous comments and a some-what storyline within this. To get to Bowser in[CR]the regular, just getting one normal exit after another path, will take you 33[CR]exits. However, if you are a player who likes looking for secret exits,[CR]finding new Overworld areas and paths, then you will have a whole 93 exits to[CR]find. Only used Lunar Magic and the instant Death blocks in this hack, so its[CR]mostly a vanilla hack. It is pretty easy in the beginning and slowly gets much[CR]much harder. Many levels have hidden bonuses and secret surprises... So, what[CR]are you waiting for? Download this and have fun! Oh yeah, and since this is[CR]The Unworld, expect to see some interesting palettes... Nothing ugly or[CR]damaging, just... out there...</plot>

There are a few [CR]assembly hacks which cannot be achieved within[CR]the editor alone, but they are[CR]few in number and mostly for convenience or[CR]cosmetic purposes.[CR]It may seem at first that the changes are limited to[CR]gameplay and the plot is[CR]unchanged, but dont worry, there is a point in the[CR]plot after which it[CR]branches from the original and begins an entirely new[CR]chain of events.[CR]There are many interesting choices you can make which will[CR]impact certain[CR]details of the game. Some of these involve the configuration[CR]of your party;[CR]some will remove a character if he or she is present, while[CR]others will add a[CR]character if you have at least one empty slot. These[CR]changes cannot be undone[CR]later, but each such event has a place to save[CR]relatively nearby, so if you[CR]find something happens to your party that you[CR]didnt want, simply reset and [CR]dont finish that event or start a new save[CR]file.[CR]Visit the Training Room in Baron for a cursory overview of changes[CR]and other[CR]miscellaneous hints and tips.[CR]Applying the[CR]Patch[CR]------------------[CR]ORIGINAL ROM: Final Fantasy[CR]II(U)(V1.1).smc[CR]Please ensure that your rom is:[CR] * V1.1[CR] * Unheadered[CR](should be 1,048,576 bytes)[CR] * Clean; i.e. it has never been patched with[CR]anything else or otherwise[CR] modified in any way. This includes having been[CR]saved with FF4kster. Even[CR] if you changed nothing within the editor,[CR]FF4kster makes changes to a[CR] clean ROM upon saving, regardless.[CR]Here are[CR]some checksums you can use to verify your rom if you have trouble:[CR]CRC32:[CR]23084FCD[CR]SHA-1: 41A74EB369A7A91815529EF99AB1B20E2BDF3E26[CR]SHA-256:[CR]414BACC05A18A6137C0DE060B4094AB6D1B75105342B0BB36A42E45D945A0E4D[CR]MD5:[CR]27D02A4F03E172E029C9B82AC3DB79F7[CR]If your game crashes during the opening,[CR]if you get strange end-game weapons[CR]from very early-game chests or monster[CR]drops, or if you find clones of Palom[CR]and Porom in strange places blocking[CR]your progress, chances are you have[CR]patched the wrong rom, or something[CR]otherwise went wrong in the[CR]patching[CR]process.[CR]Changelog[CR]=========[CR]4.0[CR]---[CR]* Items cannot[CR]be duplicated.[CR]* Hold Y button to dash (thanks to Crow! and[CR]Myself086).[CR]* Ciriatto and Malacoda are nerfed a little.[CR]* Float is[CR]learned earlier but costs more MP.[CR]* Twins start at a higher level.[CR]*[CR]Some characters stat growth improved.[CR]* Black chocobo no longer[CR]automatically goes home.[CR]* Ice Mines music glitch fixed.[CR]* A few[CR]treasures changed in various places.[CR]* Cagnazzo shell form glitch[CR]fixed.[CR]* Dark Mist AI changed.[CR]* Dark Elf awards more exp.[CR]* "Fiends"[CR]can no longer be reflect-petrified.[CR]* Dark Wave and Kick damage scales up[CR]better in the mid to late game.[CR]* A couple of minor dialogue changes and[CR]typo fixes.[CR]* Fat chocobos no longer require a carrot.[CR]* Serpent Road[CR]opens earlier.[CR]* Mount Ordeals opens earlier.[CR]* Twin spells changed,[CR]also they learn a new one at high enough level.[CR]* You can no longer flee[CR]from the Break Blade treasure battle.[CR]3.1[CR]---[CR]* Thanks to Chillyfeez,[CR]the music in the DarkMist battle now loops[CR] correctly.[CR]3.0[CR]---[CR]*[CR]The FF4kster config files for this hack are now included in the zip. Just[CR]extract the contents of the "config" folder over the default FF4kster one[CR]and everything will be labelled for Unprecedented Crisis rather than for[CR]default FF4. If you want to preserve the old config files, you can simply[CR]make a copy of your FF4kster folder in a new location before overwriting.[CR]Once again, I am a poor record keeper so even with the updated config[CR]files, its possible that some things are not named correctly, but it[CR] beats[CR]trying to use it with the original config files.[CR]* Something special[CR]happens when you beat the game with solo Cecil (i.e. if[CR] you remove all[CR]your other party members and just go into the final dungeon[CR] sequence with[CR]Cecil alone). A different special thing will happen based on[CR] whether you[CR]did it with solo Dark Knight or solo Paladin.[CR]* Aegis shield has its KO[CR]immunity back to make solo runs easier/possible. I[CR] now have a different[CR]solution to the Golbez/Shadow battle lock.[CR]* Someone in the training room[CR]now explains a commonly requested tidbit of[CR] information relating to a[CR]certain item.[CR]* Various minor bugfixes hardly worth[CR]mentioning.[CR]2.1[CR]---[CR]* Removed KO immunity from Aegis shield. Having[CR]KO immunity made it possible[CR] to get the game stuck in an infinite loop at[CR]a certain point if you had it[CR] equipped.[CR]2.0[CR]---[CR]I am a poor[CR]record-keeper and did not exhaustively track every change I made,[CR]but here[CR]are some of the highlights:[CR]* Smoother difficulty curve: The previous[CR]version had several sudden jumps up[CR] in difficulty, particularly the[CR]transition to the underground. Several[CR] steps have been taken to smooth out[CR]the difficulty increases, including[CR] changes to monster stats, AIs, and[CR]Experience rewards. There is also now a[CR] new monster domain for the Mist[CR]cave when you visit it the second time, as[CR] well as new treasures (dont[CR]worry, you can still get them the first time;[CR] theyll respawn).[CR]* Angel[CR]Wings: The previous version featured a lot of damage floor (i.e. the[CR] same[CR]amount found in the original FF4/FF2US). However, since the damage[CR] floor[CR]dungeons are not optional in this version like they were originally,[CR] and[CR]since they are initially tackled before your characters are likely to[CR] have[CR]learned Float, a couple of compromises were made. First, some damage[CR] tiles[CR]have been removed, particularly on the "treasure route" of Bahamuts[CR] Lagoon[CR](originally the Sylph Cave). Second, there is an item for sale in[CR] the[CR]underwold shops called Angel Wings which, when used in battle, cast[CR] Float[CR]on the party. Just as Float normally does, it will persist outside[CR] of[CR]battle and remain until you take a staircase or warp/teleport.[CR]* New[CR]commands: Cid and Kain were a little boring in the first version, I[CR] found,[CR]so they each now have a new command. Kain has "Lance" (Lancet)[CR] which is a[CR]weaker physical attack, but it drains HP (dont target undeads[CR] with it).[CR]Cid now has "Dash" which causes him to ram himself into an enemy[CR] much like[CR]Umaro from FF6. It deals damage equal to Cids current HP[CR] (usually a lot[CR]more than his attack would deal) but brings him to 1 HP. It[CR] is mainly[CR]useful as a finishing move, or you can spam it if you carry lots[CR] of items[CR]and/or have someone who can cast Arise or Cure 4 consistently.[CR]* More[CR]hints: Barons Training Room is now full of useful tips, both things[CR]pertaining to this hack in particular as well as lesser-known facts about[CR]FF4s game mechanics that are handy to know. There is also a little more[CR]guidance given, both in certain plot scenes, as well as by NPCs (talk to[CR]people in Agart!) that provide a little more direction for where to go in[CR]case the player gets stuck.[CR]* Spell progressions: Certain spells have been[CR]changed a little, and many[CR] characters have had their spell progressions[CR]completely rearranged. Youre[CR] still unlikely to have Float your first time[CR]through the underground[CR] dungeons, but youll almost certainly have it by[CR]the time you go back,[CR] should you decide to do so.[CR]* Weapons: Many[CR]weapons have been retooled a little. The Sleep blade, Chaos[CR] blade, and[CR]Icebrand have all been buffed a little, the knives have been[CR] drastically[CR]reworked, and the bows have been buffed slightly. The axes and[CR] hammers[CR]have also been buffed a bit.[CR]* Starting inventory: The player now begins[CR]with one of each basic attack and[CR] recovery item, except for one FireBomb[CR]and one Lit-Bolt (Cecil uses those[CR] during the opening ^_^). In addition,[CR]-Sort- and the Trashcan default to[CR] being at the top of the item screen[CR]rather than the bottom (you can still[CR] move them).[CR]* Speed-run trap:[CR]There is a technique speedrunners use to skip the plot[CR] scene in Mist in[CR]the beginning and get access to the Mist shops way[CR] earlier than intended.[CR]You dont want to do this. Trust me. Youve been[CR] warned.[CR]* Party size[CR]detection: As mentioned in the preamble above, you are no longer[CR] given the[CR]choice to add a party member to a full party, potentially[CR] crashing or[CR]otherwise messing up your game. This is due to the[CR] implementation of a[CR]technique for the games automatic tracking of your[CR] party size. As a[CR]result, it can also tell if you are alone (solo Cecil),[CR] and certain[CR]details of certain events have special cases for this[CR]situation.[CR]Credits[CR]-------[CR]Pinkpuff[CR]Chillyfeez[CR]Grimoire[CR]LD[CR]Crow![CR]Myself086</plot>

    <plot>This is the sequel to Mario's Strange Quest.

What really happened after Mario beat[CR]Bowser, rescued Yoshi's eggs, and saved the princess was that Yoshi and his[CR]sleepy friend decided to move to a new land so that he can protect his eggs[CR]from Bowser before they really hatched. So, both Yoshis do so and they find[CR]themselves in the land of Weirdonia. However, it seems that Bowser apparently[CR]insists on stealing Yoshi's eggs, since Yoshi's eggs were stolen again while[CR]Yoshi was out shopping.

Note: Yoshifanatic[CR]plans on doing more YSQ art in the future.[CR]- Lots of silliness and general[CR]weirdness[CR]- A box art image, a cartridge sticker image, and a game manual,[CR]since real SNES games come with these things[CR]- Older versions of YSQ (V1.0,[CR]V1.1, V1.2, and V1.3 Beta) are linked to in the readme for those that are[CR]interested in seeing what YSQ was like in past versions[CR]- Lots of secrets[CR]to find[CR]- Free novelty T-shirts with every download*[CR]*T-shirt not[CR]included.[CR]====Controls====[CR]Since the player plays as Yoshi, Yoshi has[CR]some moves that Mario cant do (either because Yoshi is a Yoshi or because of[CR]the advancement of technology and game design (or something like that)). You[CR]will need to master these unique moves if you want to help Yoshi retrieve his[CR]stolen eggs![CR]A button - Aim eggs, Throw Eggs.[CR]B button (in midair) -[CR]Flutter Jump (press B in midair again to do another Flutter Jump)[CR]X button[CR]- Stick out tongue, spit out whatever is in Yoshis mouth[CR]Y button - Stick[CR]out tongue, spit out whatever is in Yoshis mouth[CR]Up + X or Y - Stick out[CR]tongue (upwards), spit out whatever is in Yoshis mouth (upwards) [CR]Down (in[CR]midair) - Ground Pound[CR]Up (holding it while aiming an egg) - Aim the egg[CR]straight up[CR]Up (while standing next to someone) - Talk to certain NPCs[CR]R button (while in level) - lock/unlock targeting cursor when aiming an[CR]egg[CR]R button (while on overworld) - Toggle between Hasty and Patient egg[CR]throwing styles[CR]L button (while on overworld) - Bring up save[CR]prompt[CR]Down (while aiming an egg) - cancel aiming an egg[CR]Select (while[CR]on Overworld) - Bring up the status screen[CR]Start (while a dialogue box is[CR]on screen) - Close dialogue box (Note: Some dialogue boxes cant be closed by[CR]pressing start)[CR]Yoshi also possesses all the moves Mario has in the[CR]original SMW, except spin jumping, throwing fireballs, and flying with a[CR]cape.[CR]====Notes====[CR]- Press the L button while on the overworld to bring[CR]up the save prompt, so you can save your game.[CR]- Unlike Mario, Yoshi cant[CR]spin Jump. The ground pound replaces the spin jump, though there are some[CR]things it cant do (like jumping off spiked enemies).[CR]- Yoshi always runs.[CR]No need to hold the X or Y buttons to run.[CR]- The counter on the lower left[CR]corner of the screen is your health counter. Every time Yoshi is hurt, this[CR]counter decreases by five. If the counter goes below 0, Yoshi will lose a[CR]life. Collect green coins (or stars that red eggs create when they hit an[CR]enemy) to refill the counter. Yoshi can have a maximum of 30 HP at once,[CR]allowing him to take up to 7 hits before dying (on normal mode, at[CR]least...).[CR]- Speaking of green coins, you can collect them by either[CR]touching them, tossing an egg at them, or by hitting them with a shell.[CR]-[CR]Yoshi is unable to grab most things with his hands. Instead, you must grab[CR]items, like springboards and shells with Yoshis tongue.[CR]- You can acquire[CR]eggs by eating enemies (though some cant be eaten, like Piranha Plants), and[CR]some cant be swallowed (like Koopa Shells) or picking them up off the ground[CR](either out in the open, from an egg plant, or from a green spotted[CR]block).[CR]- Yoshi can use three different kinds of eggs. Green eggs have no[CR]special properties. Yellow eggs create a coin when they hit an enemy. Red eggs[CR]create two stars that give Yoshi 1 HP each. [CR]- Whenever Yoshi gets an egg[CR]from one of the above methods, it will start to follow Yoshi from behind. This[CR]is how you can tell how many eggs Yoshi has. He can have up to six eggs[CR]following him at once.[CR]- If you see cracked looking rocks, you can break[CR]them with ground pounds, throwing eggs at them, or hitting them from[CR]below.[CR]- Yoshi loves green watermelons. Collect one of a 1-up.[CR]-[CR]Whenever you press the R button while on the overworld, youll change Yoshis[CR]egg throwing style, which is determined by what sound you hear when you press[CR]the button. If you hear a fireball throwing sound, you switched it to "Hasty",[CR]but if you hear a coin sound, then you switched it to "Patient". With Patient,[CR]you have to press the A button twice to throw an egg; once to aim the egg,[CR]then again to throw. With Hasty, you have to press and hold the A button to[CR]aim, then release the A button to throw.[CR]- With flutter jumping, it can be[CR]tricky to do at first. Heres how to do it properly. Whenever Yoshi finishes[CR]his current flutter jump, there is a short delay before he can do another[CR]flutter jump. Press and hold the jump button during this delay to ensure that[CR]Yoshi will flutter jump again once this delay is over. Practice this timing[CR]and youll eventually be able to flutter jump like a pro.[CR]- Experiment with[CR]how long you let Yoshi do a flutter jump for. There are various obstacles that[CR]can only be overcome by flutter jumping a certain way, such as using that[CR]slight boost Yoshi gets from the flutter jump to get around obstacles in areas[CR]where the ceiling is too low, or cancelling flutter jumps repeatedly to slow[CR]Yoshis fall.[CR]- If youve ever played Yoshis Island before, then you should[CR]know that many of the strategies and tricks you used in that game will work in[CR]this game. However, some things work slightly different from YI, such as the[CR]flutter jumping, so keep that in mind.[CR]- Some levels disable some of Yoshis[CR]abilities, though its usually justified in some way (ex. Yoshi enters an area[CR]that is very gross, causing him to lose his appetite, meaning Yoshi wont be[CR]able to use his tongue).[CR]- Some characters that Yoshi encounters on his[CR]journey can be talked to by pressing up. Not everyone will want to talk to[CR]you, though.[CR]- Every level, except for Yoshis House, has a set of invisible[CR]1-up checkpoints that will give you a 1-up if you find them. These are usually[CR]found in seemingly empty spots or in places that youll most likely not go to[CR]normally. Youre not required to find these for 100% completion (though if this[CR]game had achievements, this would probably be one of them), theyre just an[CR]optional little secret for you to find, much like bonus rooms, scenario rooms,[CR]or error message rooms.[CR]- Yoshi is a bit out of shape, thus he has a harder[CR]time flutter jumping compared to the average Yoshi. He cant get a boost from[CR]it at the peak of his jump, it can take him a while to rise up if he has a lot[CR]of downwards momentum, and since he has to make such an effort and focus to[CR]stay airborne, he loses his focus if he hits his head on the ceiling,[CR]requiring you to hit the button again to continue flutter jumping.[CR]- You[CR]can re-enter destroyed switch palaces, castles, and fortresses the same way[CR]you normally enter levels.[CR]- The L and R buttons are handy for those[CR]situations where you want to see farther ahead, such as a wide pit that you[CR]cant see the other side of when youre in the middle of the screen or to spot[CR]an enemy that may be a problem during a jump. You can also use Yoshis flutter[CR]jump in a similar way, where you can jump to the side, then flutter jump back[CR]to the ledge you jumped from in order to scout out whats ahead before doing a[CR]tricky section.[CR]- Sometimes, youll need to think outside the box to get[CR]past something, to solve a puzzle, or to find a secret exit.[CR]- Take your[CR]time when playing YSQ. YSQs levels are generally designed in a way where[CR]rushing through them will likely result in Yoshi dying. With the exception of[CR]auto scrolling levels or the rare area with a time limit, most areas in YSQ[CR]have no time limit, so you have plenty of time to think things through about[CR]the current obstacle or puzzle before doing it.[CR]- In order to advance[CR]beyond Yoshis New Home at the start of the game, you must enter it twice[CR](once, right after the intro and again after youve completed Yoshis New House[CR]and you returned to the overworld). Then, you must exit out of Yoshis New Home[CR]via side exits to go to the next level. If you think you are stuck on the[CR]overworld after beating Yoshis New House once, then it is obvious that you[CR]didnt even read this readme.[CR]- If youre an LPer who did a Lets Play of an[CR]older version of YSQ and are planning on LPing the newest version, I recommend[CR]that still show everything again. So much has changed in V1.3 over V1.2, even[CR]the stages that look almost the same as before may have a few new surprises or[CR]interesting changes.[CR]====Special Stuff====[CR]- Outside materials:[CR]I[CR]made some extra materials for YSQ that should be in this .zip folder, since I[CR]wanted YSQ to feel more like a real SNES game and because I wanted YSQ to[CR]stand out among other SMW hacks. The .zip folder for this hack contains,[CR]besides the patch/game and this readme:[CR]1). A box art drawing, which is a[CR]drawing I did myself that shows what the cover of the box might look like if[CR]YSQ actually came in a box.[CR]Download Link:[CR]https://www.dropbox.com/s/1dig87wozi6fq87/YSQ%20Box%20Art.png?dl=0[CR]2). A[CR]cartridge sticker image, which is meant to show what the cartridge sticker[CR]would look like. If you have a SNES flash cart or you are hardcore enough to[CR]actually put this game on a real SNES cartridge, you could print out this[CR]image and put it on the cartridge to make it feel more like YSQ is an actual[CR]SNES game. If you actually do this, then the dimensions of the sticker are:[CR]Width = 3.25 inches, Height = 1.75 inches (which is about 7.5% of the size of[CR]the image). In addition, you should fold the image about 0.25 inches from the[CR]top (which is where the top of the fat red line is at) as well as round out[CR]the corners. If you want to print it out, one way of doing so would be to open[CR]up Microsoft Word (if you have it), importing the sticker image into MS Word,[CR]shrinking the image to half its size in MS Word, setting the page size to 3.25[CR]in. X 1.75 in., then printing it out. What you print out should be about the[CR]correct size, and its quality should be about the same as it was in MS[CR]Word.[CR]Download Link:[CR]https://www.dropbox.com/s/32n2hpup6lfstca/YSQ%20Cartridge%20Sticker.png?dl=0[CR]3).[CR]A game manual, which is written in a way youd expect a game manual to be[CR]written. As in, it doesnt assume that youve played SMW before like this readme[CR]does. The reason that this readme is still included is because there might be[CR]some people who cant open .pdf files and this readme mentions things that[CR]would be kind of odd to mention in the manual, like the version history and[CR]glitches.[CR]Download Link:[CR]https://www.dropbox.com/s/vy0mp9diu0hgbqs/YSQ%20Manual.pdf?dl=0[CR]- Scenario[CR]rooms[CR]Throughout the land of Weirdonia are what are called "Scenario Rooms"[CR]where the player is presented with a situation involving Yoshi in some way,[CR]and the player must pick from three choices, which represent what Yoshi can do[CR]for that given scenario. The choice you make in each one of these rooms[CR]determines what reward you get. Can you find all 10 of them?[CR]- Yoshi[CR]Coins[CR]Every level in YSQ has 5 Yoshi coins for you to collect. Each one is[CR]worth 20 coins, and if you collect all 5 in a level, youll get an extra life.[CR]If you can collect every Yoshi coin in the game, then youll be rewarded in[CR]some way that Im going to keep a secret...[CR]If you can do it without using[CR]cheats, savestates, rewinds, etc. (which I imagine is not how most people are[CR]going to do this. I dare you to prove me wrong), then you deserve some kind of[CR]medal for your amazing platforming skills![CR]Note: If you die before[CR]collecting all 5 Yoshi coins, then youll lose the Yoshi coins you collected in[CR]that level, so be careful![CR]- Status Screen[CR]Pressing start while youre on[CR]the overworld will bring up a status screen that keeps track of your progress[CR]through YSQ. This screen will tell you what levels youve been to, which exits[CR]youve triggered for those levels, and whether or not you got all 5 Yoshi coins[CR]in any level that has them. If you get 100% exits, then you can also use the[CR]status screen to warp to any level on the overworld at will, and if you get[CR]100% of all the Yoshi coins, a Yoshi coin will appear on the status screen to[CR]indicate that you found them all (Note: This isnt the reward I mentioned in[CR]the Yoshi Coins entry above. Please dont send me angry messages about how you[CR]spent so much time and had so much trouble trying to get all the Yoshi coins[CR]and then thinking that the reward was just a Yoshi coin icon on the status[CR]screen. If you do this, then I have permission to laugh at you for not reading[CR]the readme. Dont give me a reason to laugh at you!)[CR]- Hard mode[CR]Whenever[CR]you go to select a file, you will have the option of selecting the difficulty[CR]level of YSQ. Normal mode is the standard difficulty, while Hard mode brings[CR]back the difficulty that V1.2 of YSQ had. Enabling hard mode will do the[CR]following:[CR]1). Doubles Yoshis knockback when he gets hit, up to V1.2[CR]levels.[CR]2). Increases the damage Yoshi takes from 5 to 10.[CR]3). Caps the[CR]maximum health Yoshi can have to 20 instead of 30.[CR]4). Midpoint tapes[CR]become useless (theyll still be present; they just wont do anything)[CR]5).[CR]Starts you off with 2 lives instead of 5.[CR] [CR]Are you hardcore enough to[CR]100% the game in hard mode, especially without using cheats, savestates,[CR]rewinds, etc.?[CR]- Boss Rush[CR]If you get 100% of all the exits, this option[CR]will become available by hitting the green block in Yoshis house. How fast you[CR]can beat each of the bosses in YSQ?[CR]- Secret music house[CR]Once you beat a[CR]certain level, this will become available to you by hitting the note block in[CR]Yoshis house. Listen to all the songs in the game from the many talented music[CR]porters who did them.[CR]- Error message rooms[CR]These are simply rooms that[CR]either are caused by the player failing in an impossible or silly way, or they[CR]are rooms that Yoshifanatic forgot to test while he was making this hack, and[CR]thus, they decided to glitch out in bizarre ways while he wasnt looking. Can[CR]you find all 10 of these strange rooms?[CR]- Replaying the Switch[CR]Palaces[CR]Once youve beaten a switch palace, youll be able to re-enter it[CR]just like any other level. Beating a switch palace a second time nets you a[CR]reward and is also required to get all Yoshi coins in each switch palace.[CR]-[CR]The pink, red and yellow ? blocks in Yoshis house.[CR]What do these do? Im not[CR]telling. If you reach certain points in YSQ, youll unlock whatever function[CR]these blocks serve.[CR]====Version History====[CR]Updates in V1.0[CR](https://www.dropbox.com/s/p1hhvkggu5kzskp/YSQV1.0.zip?dl=0)[CR]- What[CR]updates? This is the original version of YSQ.[CR]Updates in V1.1[CR](https://www.dropbox.com/s/611etotv3lbhptg/YSQV1.1.zip?dl=0)[CR]- There are[CR]three times more levels than in V1.0.[CR]- I changed the song that plays in a[CR]few of the levels, as well as the song that plays on the cave submap on the[CR]overworld.[CR]- Two of the Switch Palaces are now different colors.[CR]- Some[CR]of the levels in world one have been moved somewhere else on the[CR]overworld.[CR]- Some of the levels that were in V1.0 have a few secrets added[CR]to them. [CR]- The load times are a little shorter (not that they were long to[CR]begin with).[CR]- During some cutscenes, I made it so that all sprite graphics[CR]are invisible, in order to prevent the player from seeing stuff thats not[CR]supposed to be visible.[CR]- A couple of messages were added or changed[CR]slightly.[CR]- One of the overworld paths was changed, because it caused[CR]Yoshis position to be wrong on the overworld.[CR]- I changed the graphics for[CR]most of the food items to make them look better.[CR]- There are various minor[CR]improvements that dont really need to be listed individually.[CR]Updates in[CR]V1.2 (https://www.dropbox.com/s/55hx3gfapwifxx5/YSQV1.2.zip?dl=0)[CR]- The[CR]custom ASM has far fewer glitches with it, and has a few extra features.[CR]-[CR]Many of the levels have been changed slightly to work better with the fixed[CR]ASM[CR]- Midpoints have been added to many levels [CR]- I added an extra[CR]cutscene to one of the levels.[CR]- A few more songs have been added to the[CR]game.[CR]- I changed the "Yoshi Presents" sprite so that it looks completely[CR]different from the original "Nintendo Presents" sprite.[CR]- I added a Credits[CR]sequence to the end of demo level[CR]- When you enter a level, it now says[CR]"Yoshi Start!" instead of nothing.[CR]- I fixed a glitch in Misty Mine, so[CR]that you wont be forced to die if you press down while in a barrel cannon.[CR]However, this means that you can no longer shoot straight down in them (not[CR]that you have to shoot in that direction, anyway)[CR]- I made several minor[CR]adjustments that arent worth mentioning.[CR]Updates in V1.3 Beta[CR](https://www.dropbox.com/s/1wr5bflw61e0xc0/YSQ%20V1.3Beta.zip?dl=0)[CR]- There[CR]are twice as many levels as there were in V1.2, and several old levels have[CR]been lengthened or changed in some way.[CR]- The game has been made easier in[CR]general, at least during normal mode...[CR]- A new difficulty level has been[CR]added, which is hard.[CR]- A status screen has been added to the overworld, so[CR]you can keep track of your progress throughout the game.[CR]- Midpoints have[CR]been added to most levels that didnt have them before.[CR]- Many more songs[CR]have been added to YSQ. This includes a new death and game over theme, as well[CR]as a victory theme when you complete a level.[CR]- Some areas now play[CR]different music, such as the title screen.[CR]- Layer 3 water is now[CR]transparent.[CR]- The blue bars that are a part of the water effect HDMA used[CR]in some levels are no longer there, in order to fix a glitch where those bars[CR]would appear for a second while transitioning to another level.[CR]- I fixed a[CR]serious bug where, if you are playing YSQ in BSNES Accuracy mode or on a real[CR]SNES, certain message spites might not display the message they were supposed[CR]to.[CR]- A few levels have been moved elsewhere on the overworld, merged with[CR]another level, or had their level design changed.[CR]- I fixed a lot of bugs[CR]with the Yoshi Player patch, such as the glitch where the green coins didnt[CR]always give you health when picked up, the glitch where Yoshis tongue would[CR]get stopped by or stuck on certain things for no reason, the glitch where[CR]Yoshi can continue ground pounding through spiked enemies, etc.[CR]- Ive made[CR]various graphical and palette edits to improve the graphics.[CR]- I fixed the[CR]glitches with certain custom sprites, like the barrel cannon, the soda bottle,[CR]and the World 2 boss.[CR]- The two known cases where a static sound would play[CR]at the start of a song have been fixed.[CR]- Ive switched to a new message[CR]format that enhances all the text in this hack immensely. Every scenario room[CR]and most of the cutscenes are now in this format.[CR]- You can no longer see[CR]what Yoshi is thinking about during the castle cutscenes, due to the new way[CR]the cutscenes are presented. However, most of the things Yoshi was thinking[CR]about during those cutscenes are now a part of his dialogue in those[CR]cutscenes.[CR]- Yoshis New Home now serves as a hub, where you can access[CR]various stuff. More stuff is unlocked as you progress in the hack.[CR]- The[CR]intro gives more details about the story, and it is now an actual level.[CR]-[CR]Ive written a tutorial, which is accessed from Yoshis New Home, telling you[CR]how Yoshis unique moves work.[CR]- The switch palace room in Yoshis New Home[CR]has been dummied out, because switch palaces can now be re-entered from the[CR]overworld[CR]- You can now save the game at any time by pressing the L button[CR]on the overworld.[CR]- A few extra features have been added to the Yoshi[CR]Player patch, such as randomized idle animations and the patient/hasty egg[CR]throwing style setting.[CR]- Some levels now have a parallax scrolling HDMA[CR]effect.[CR]- Most underwater areas now have a blue (or another color in some[CR]cases) tint to them, to make those areas look more like they are[CR]underwater.[CR]- The Yoshis in Yoshi Woods have more animations and you can[CR]now talk to them.[CR]- Bonus rooms have been added to a few more levels.[CR]-[CR]I fixed a strange glitch where Yoshi would sometimes start at the midpoint of[CR]levels hed never been to before, particularly S.S.Sunk.[CR]- The P-switch[CR]theme has been removed, in order to fix a few music glitches caused by having[CR]sampled death and victory themes.[CR]Updates in V1.3 (Find it on SMWCentrals[CR]hack section)[CR]- Balanced the difficulty better so certain really hard[CR]sections are easier.[CR]- Custom Layer 3 images have been added to some areas[CR]to make them look nicer.[CR]- Cyan Yoshi and Aero have been added to the[CR]game.[CR]- Reworded a few parts of some messages to make certain things[CR]clearer to the player.[CR]- Removed the layer 2 smashers and lava from the[CR]World 6 bosss arena and redesigned it to make up for that change. This was[CR]done to reduce slowdown.[CR]- Potentially fixed a bug where the game freezes[CR]after completing the puzzle in the world 6 castle on rare occasions (Not sure[CR]if this is truly fixed because I couldnt replicate it after one of my beta[CR]testers reported it).[CR]- Modified the health counter number graphics to make[CR]them easier to see in some areas.[CR]- Added idle animations to the few[CR]characters that were lacking one and gave one of those characters dialog if[CR]you decide to talk to him.[CR]- Fixed a bunch of typos in various[CR]messages.[CR]- Added the names of the people who helped beta test YSQ to the[CR]credits.[CR]- Added a few anti-cheat measures to prevent cheating (only a few.[CR]Most of the ones you may encounter are actually unintentional, as a side[CR]effect to the way YSQ was designed and how YSQ changes SMWs engine).[CR]-[CR]Removed the ? clouds because they refuse to work half the time, and I have[CR]absolutely no idea how to fix them.[CR]- Made a bunch of minor changes and bug[CR]fixes that arent too major.[CR]====Glitches====[CR]- There are possibly some[CR]spots where, depending on how many eggs Yoshi has following him, the game may[CR]slow down. It was very hard to avoid that at times, but at least it wont last[CR]too long if it does happen.[CR]- Some levels may have some minor sound[CR]glitches in them, due to the use of sample banks, echo, or AddmusicK.[CR]-[CR]Some doors/pipes/teleport blocks take the game a bit longer to load the level[CR]they take you to. This is not really a glitch (as its intentional, so that[CR]layer 2 in certain levels is placed right), but I figured Id mention[CR]this.[CR]- In some places, I used layer 3 in a level that has a message box.[CR]However, layer 3 does come back after the message ends, so this isnt really an[CR]issue.[CR]- Any time the game switches between songs (with one or two[CR]exceptions) there is a one second pause. In addition, sometimes the status bar[CR]will be in a different position during that one second on occasion. This is[CR]more of a limitation of the new music engine introduced with AddmusicK than a[CR]glitch, but I should mention this anyway. Besides, this lets me switch the[CR]sample bank mid-level for the songs that use a different sample bank than the[CR]one currently loaded, since the sample banks are loaded with the song, rather[CR]than loaded with the level.[CR]- You can only cancel a dialogue box when text[CR]is being drawn in the text box, not when its waiting for you to press A or[CR]when its paused for a bit.[CR]- In reverse gravity (aka when Yoshi is upside[CR]down relative to the enemies), Yoshi is unable to stick his tongue out and egg[CR]aiming is reversed (so, holding up will result in Yoshi aiming down).[CR]-[CR]Every once in a while when you bring up the status screen, the game might get[CR]stuck on the black screen, which I have absolutely no idea why this happens.[CR]If this happens, youll need to reset the game. I HIGHLY urge you to save your[CR]game before bringing up the status screen just in case so you dont lose any[CR]progress (thankfully, YSQ saves more things than just the events youve[CR]triggered. It also saves things like your coin count, lives, which levels you[CR]got every Yoshi coin in, etc, so its almost like loading a savestate when you[CR]reload the game normally).[CR]- YSQ made quite a few changes to SMWs engine[CR]and has so much stuff crammed into 4 MB of space, that I wouldnt be surprised[CR]if a few strange bugs pop up if you use cheats or try to modify YSQ in Lunar[CR]Magic, even if you use Version 2.30. Do not modify YSQ or use cheats, or else[CR]you may screw something up![CR]====QPMAMASPTIWAHFYC (Questions People Might[CR]Ask Me At Some Point That I Will Answer Here For Your Convenience)====[CR]- Q:[CR]"What do I need to do to start playing your hack?"[CR] [CR] A: First, go[CR]download a patching program that lets you patch an IPS patch to a ROM, such as[CR]Lunar IPS or FLIPS (you can find the former on the creator of Lunar Magics[CR]site (Fusoya) and the latter on SMWCentral.net. Alternatively, you can[CR]download the latest version of Lunar Magic which has the ability to apply an[CR]IPS patch to SMW. Next, go download a copy of the U.S. version of a headered[CR]SMW ROM (dont ask me where to find them though, cause I cant help you with[CR]that, though I will tell you that you should look for one with [!] in its name[CR]to ensure that you got a good copy, as well as [U], which means that its the[CR]U.S. version of SMW). Next, go download your SNES emulator of choice (or buy[CR]an SNES flash cart if you have an SNES and a lot of money) and start playing[CR]the game after you apply the IPS patch to the SMW ROM.[CR]- Q: "Why do most of[CR]the Yoshis in this game talk in third person?"[CR] A: That was something that[CR]I was inspired to do based on how Yoshi talked in the Super Mario World[CR]cartoon, which I thought was kind of cute. Fortunately, if you pay attention[CR]to the context of the Yoshis dialog, it shouldnt be too hard to tell if they[CR]are referring to themselves or others when they say Yoshi. As for the Yoshis[CR]that dont talk in third person, there actually is an in-game explanation for[CR]that if you talk to one of the Yoshis that doesnt speak in third person twice[CR](although the real life explanation for that would be that those Yoshis are[CR]either special cases or they are my friends characters, so they are going to[CR]talk the way they are supposed to talk).[CR]- Q: "Aaargghhh!! This jump/puzzle[CR]is impossible! How are you supposed to get past this?"[CR] A: Nothing is[CR]impossible in YSQ (assuming youre doing things correctly of course). This hack[CR]has been tested by me multiple times (both on a real SNES and an emulator) and[CR]by several others, so you should try to tackle the part youre struggling in[CR]YSQ in a different way (such as varying the way Yoshi is flutter jumping[CR]through an obstacle). If all else fails, search up a video of someone playing[CR]YSQ on that part and see how they got past it, or just message me and Ill help[CR]out.[CR]- Q: "Did you code a lot of this stuff yourself?"[CR] A: Most of the[CR]custom ASM in YSQ was done by others (for example, the Yoshi ASM that gives[CR]the player character all of Yoshis moves from Yoshis Island was done by[CR]Jimmy52905 on SMWCentral), so no. That said, there are some things I coded[CR]myself, mainly a few simple custom blocks, a couple simple sprites (like the[CR]Yoshi sprite on the lower right corner of the titlescreen), and one of the[CR]bosses. Plus, while the Yoshi ASM wasnt done by me, I did add a few extra[CR]things to it that were not in the ASM patch originally, such as the randomized[CR]idle animation, the patient/hasty egg throw option, and many bug fixes to[CR]it.[CR]- Q: "Can I use the graphics you used in YSQ?"[CR] A: Yes. Youre free[CR]to use whatever graphics you want in YSQ, except for the Yoshi OC sprites.[CR]Youll need my permission to use mine or my friends permission to use theirs.[CR]Also, I released a bunch of graphics I ripped/drew for YSQ already, so you[CR]ought to take a look at SMWCentrals graphics section to see if what you want[CR]to use has been released (the advantage of this being that I made those[CR]graphics submissions are easier to use than if you were to take them out of[CR]YSQ, since YSQs ExGFX and Map16 organization is haphazard at best).[CR]- Q: "I[CR]cant find this secret exit. Where is it?"[CR] A: Quite a few of the secret[CR]exits in YSQ are pretty deviously hidden, so dont give up if you cant seem to[CR]find it. If all else fails, go watch a video of someone playing that level you[CR]cant find the secret exit in, or just message me and Ill help out.[CR]- Q:[CR]"What is the point of the Yoshi coins?"[CR] A: They are meant to be a[CR]challenge for those that want to 100% YSQ. Plus, there is a reward for finding[CR]them all, but its a secret.[CR]- Q: "Can I use YSQ as a base for my hack?"[CR]A: Id be ok with that, but I highly dont recommend it. Youd potentially[CR]encounter lots of glitches due to the ASM changes Ive done to YSQ, and youd[CR]have absolutely no idea what most of those changes even are or where I applied[CR]them. All in all, its not worth it.[CR]- Q: "What is the meaning of[CR]life?"[CR]- A: That question has nothing to do with YSQ, but Ill answer it[CR]anyway. The meaning of life is to put meaning into your[CR]life.[CR]====Misc.====[CR]- If you have any comments about this hack, post[CR]them in the "Yoshis Strange Quest" thread on Super Mario World Central or[CR]message him on any of the sites he has an account on (besides the SMWiki). You[CR]can find him at these places:[CR] - SMWCentral (Yoshifanatic):[CR]http://www.smwcentral.net/?p=profile&amp;id;=13743[CR] - Youtube (yoshifanatic1):[CR]http://www.youtube.com/user/Yoshifanatic1[CR] - deviantART (BiggestYoshifan):[CR]http://biggestyoshifan.deviantart.com/[CR] - FurAffinity (BiggestYoshifan):[CR]http://www.furaffinity.net/user/biggestyoshifan/[CR]- This is the final[CR]version of YSQ, unless I have to submit new version that fixes any glitches me[CR]or the playtesters didnt notice (particularly if they are major[CR]glitches).[CR]- Oh, and thanks for downloading my hack! Hope you enjoy it as[CR]much as I enjoyed making it! ^_^</plot>
