    <plot>Accelebrid is one of those games with giant robots. You know, the ones that[CR]can fly and have an arsenal comparable to the Death Star. Anyway, you play as[CR]the pilot of the Silver Mare, a giant robot armor thingie that can be armed[CR]with any two of six weapons which he must use to kill terrorists that[CR]kidnapped his woman. The graphics are interesting, to say the least, as it[CR]seems to be the SNES's attempt at a quasi-3D engine. Basically, you're[CR]hurtling through a red and white corridor thing against a blue-toned[CR]background. It almost looks like someone barfed a candy cane onto your[CR]telivision while watching Jacques Coustou in a room with a strobe light. As[CR]far as shooters go, the gameplay is kinda ho-hum. It functions in that it[CR]throws stuff at you which you must destroy or dodge, so I guess it does what a[CR]shooter is supposed to at the basest levels. However, the game is nothing to[CR]write home about.[CR]Read Me:[CR]ACCELEBRID[CR]ENGLISH TRANSLATION[CR]V1.00[CR]Copyright 2001 by Aeon[CR]Genesis[CR]http://agtp.romhack.net[CR]ToC[CR]1.About Accelebrid[CR]2.Patch[CR]History[CR]3.Patch Credits[CR]4.Known issues[CR]5.Application[CR]Instructions[CR]------------------[CR]1.About[CR]Accelebrid[CR]------------------[CR]Accelebrid is a chase-view shooter.

    <plot>Developers trying to make their games fresh and new by slapping something[CR]"innovative" onto a successful formula is nothing new. It's also nothing[CR]exclusive to video games. It is, however, a rare thing in any medium to[CR]discover that such an act was done right. Actraiser is one of those rare[CR]games. The game starts with an interesting concept. You are a god. Literally.[CR]You even have your very own little cherub buddy to help you out. The world is[CR]very much your oyster. Then you're thrown into a side scrolling action game.[CR]okay, that's kind of cool. hacking and slashing is fun, and the backgrounds,[CR]enemies, and bosses are pretty slick- looking. And then the gameplay[CR]completely changes into a relatively simple simulation-type game, with you in[CR]total control. Actraiser takes these two very different game types and[CR]seamlessly melds them into a work of pure gaming bliss. The world is divided[CR]up into different regions. The first time you go to a region, you enter a[CR]side-scrolling platformer stage. If you make it through and defeat the boss,[CR]you gain access to the overhead sim part of the region. During this portion of[CR]the game you guide villagers in the construction of the town. You have to[CR]destroy terrain that inhibits expansion, and appease your worshipers. And you[CR]have to guide your cherub buddy in keeping the monsters at bay until the[CR]villagers can seal the portals they're coming out of. keep the villagers happy[CR]and they give you gifts, which range from power-ups to items to use in other[CR]villages. Once you've sealed all the monster portals the final dungeon for the[CR]region is revealed-another side scroller. Beat that stage and you've cleared[CR]the region. You can play the regions in any order, but you'll likely have to[CR]keep revisiting previous regions as you progress to use some item that you[CR]just received to solve a lingering problem in another village. It's this kind[CR]of interaction that really brings the game together-it really feels like[CR]you're getting to know the people who are worshiping you. The other point to[CR]the simulation part is to level up the avatar you go spelunking through[CR]dungeons with. As the total population of the world increases, so too do your[CR]levels. Increased levels in turn give you more spell charges and higher[CR]maximum health, which make the side scrolling stages easier. Actraiser is a[CR]brilliant combination of two different, yet popular genres. Each portion of[CR]the game feels natural, and blatantly effects the other- everything you do[CR]matters. Nothing feels gimmicky or tacked-on. It's sad that it saw just one[CR]sequel, and that nobody has seen fit to try and create something like it[CR]since.[CR]Read Me:[CR]ACTRAISER[CR]ENGLISH TRANSLATION V1.00[CR]Copyright[CR]2006 by Aeon Genesis[CR]http://agtp.romhack.net[CR]ToC[CR]1. About[CR]Actraiser[CR]2. Patch History[CR]3. Patch Credits and Contributors[CR]4. Known[CR]issues[CR]5. Application Instructions[CR]-----------------[CR]1.About[CR]Actraiser[CR]-----------------[CR]Actraiser, one of the first games ever[CR]released for the[CR]Super NES, was coincidentally one of the most[CR]ground-[CR]breaking games Ive ever had the fortune to play. It[CR]playfully[CR]mixes action segments with real-time simulation,[CR]throws some RPG elements[CR]into the pot and allows it to[CR]boil. The result is one of the most[CR]interesting and fun[CR]games Ive ever played.[CR]In Actraiser, you play the[CR]role of a god whose world has[CR]been ravaged by Satan. It is a barren world;[CR]life only[CR]appears in the twisted forms of the monsters that roam[CR]its[CR]surface. Your first task in each region is to take on[CR]an earthly form and[CR]strike down the monsters that inhabit[CR]it. This takes the form of a[CR]sidescrolling action sequence.[CR]After the "Act" has been cleared, you are[CR]then tasked with[CR]fostering the return of humankind and the growth[CR]of[CR]civilization in the town. This takes the form of a top-[CR]down[CR]simulation; you control an angel to fight off airborne[CR]demons, tell the[CR]people where to build, perform miracles,[CR]and solve the various everyday[CR]problems that the folks[CR]come up with. Its very cleverly done - as the[CR]worlds[CR]population increases, so too does your level and[CR]strength.[CR]---------------[CR]2.Patch History[CR]---------------[CR]This[CR]project initially started as a translation of the[CR]French version of the[CR]game, which included an "expert mode"[CR]selectable from the main menu, along[CR]with the "normal" game.[CR]Like the US version of Megaman 2, the so-called[CR]expert mode[CR]was really the original Japanese difficulty, while[CR]the[CR]normal was the easier, more comfortable version custom-made[CR]for an[CR]American audience. This is, instead, a complete[CR]retranslation of the[CR]original Japanese version; no such easy[CR]mode is present. While many of the[CR]differences are cosmetic,[CR]there are a few references (to honorable suicide[CR]and[CR]slavery) that, I believe, were deemed offensive, and if I[CR]recall[CR]correctly, were removed from the US version of the[CR]game. Also, as[CR]mentioned, much of the game is harder; there[CR]are more obstacles and[CR]enemies, and spells often take up[CR]more than 1MP each (making the Shooting[CR]Star magic[CR]substantially less brokenly-powerful, as it can be used[CR]much[CR]less frequently.) [CR]October 21, 2006 - Initial version 1.00[CR]Release[CR]---------------[CR]3.Patch Credits[CR]---------------[CR]THE[CR]ACTRAISER TEAM[CR]Main Team:[CR]Gideon Zhi - Project leader, Romhacker,[CR]Translator[CR]Ian Kelley - Japanese Translator[CR]--------------[CR]4.Known[CR]Issues[CR]--------------[CR]--One of the testers reported that the game hung[CR]for him on[CR] on the "AREA CLEAR" screen after defeating the final boss.[CR]I have since only been able to replicate this by enabling[CR] an infinite[CR]health code, so I am unsure as to whether or[CR] not it is really an[CR]issue.[CR]Please report any other bugs, spelling errors, and[CR]such on The[CR]Pantheon (http://donut.parodius.com/agtp)[CR]Screenshots are preferred, as are[CR]savestates.[CR]--------------------------[CR]6.Application[CR]Instructions[CR]--------------------------[CR]If using ZSNES, make sure that[CR]the patch has the same name as your ROM.[CR]In other words, if your ROM is[CR]called "actj.smc" make sure the patch[CR]is "actj.ips" okay? If youre using a[CR]Mac, a Mac IPS patcher is[CR]available. Check the AGTP Links page. If youre[CR]using a copier, you[CR]probably already know how to patch the ROM :) Be sure[CR]to apply the[CR]patch to a clean copy of the ROM, and make sure your ROM DOES[CR]NOT HAVE[CR]A HEADER!. If you right-click the ROM and select Properties,[CR]it[CR]should read "Size: 1.00 MB (1,048,576 bytes)". SNESTool will remove[CR]all[CR]of your headers for you easily, and you can find it[CR]at[CR]http://www.romhacking.net[CR]In the Utilities section, simply search for[CR]snestool.[CR]An easy way to tell if the game has a header or not is that if[CR]you[CR]apply the patch and the game does not boot, your game very likely[CR]does[CR]not have a[CR]header.[CR]-----------------[CR]6.Troubleshooting[CR]-----------------[CR]--If[CR]the game does not run at all, read the above section on[CR] application[CR]instructions (specifically on header removal.)[CR] Make sure your ROM is not[CR]read-only when you remove its header.[CR] Also make sure that if you[CR]previously hard-patched the ROM and[CR] the game crashes as described, you[CR]will need to re-apply the[CR] patch a clean, Japanese original ROM.</plot>

    <plot>Alcahest! This game is... different. It's sort of an action/rpg, it's sort of[CR]an arcade game. You play as this guy Alen who runs around slashing things with[CR]his sword and collecting other swords and stuff. You can collect power-ups[CR]that expire after a fairly short amount of time, and you can do a charge[CR]attack, all in standard arcade fashion. What makes Alcahest different from[CR]most arcade games is that it's not nearly as maddeningly difficult as, say,[CR]Mars Matrix. You also get continues. Yeah, that's right, you have -limited[CR]bloody continues- to beat the game with. But that's okay, you can earn more,[CR]and the fewer you have the easier it is to gain more. You don't really get[CR]experience or anything, your "EXP" is really just credits towards your next[CR]continue, and you lose all your "EXP" if you game-over. The storyline is...[CR]fairly cliche. It's not necessarily -bad- per se, but it's very much standard[CR]fare. Demon-thing made of hate, hero-guy collects elemental weapons and[CR]companions and kicks ass, lots of manipulation of greedy bastards by the hate-[CR]demon-thing. No earth-shattering plot twists or anything, which the game sorta[CR]needs, but eh, whatever. It's an action game. The characters are sufficiently[CR]cool, but by the time you get to the final level you'll be using the guy with[CR]the homing shots exclusively for everything but boss battles, and the healer[CR]chick for boss battles. Everyone else is just sorta chump change in[CR]comparison, even for the cool dragon chick :( Neat trick, by the way - when[CR]you beat the game (it's not that long; five hours most I'd say) let it sit on[CR]the "END" screen for a while. Alen will show up and start showing off some of[CR]his more puny moves, and the game will cycle through every single music track[CR]for your listening or SPC-ripping enjoyment. Joy! So yeah. I had fun with it,[CR]but I'm not sure if I'd want to play it again. It was cool while it lasted,[CR]but my attack-charging thumb is goddamn sore after that final[CR]boss*%(![CR]Read[CR]Me:[CR]=============[CR]Alcahest[CR]=============[CR]Release patch version[CR]1.0 beta[CR]22:35 11/08/2002[CR]===============================================[CR]Japanese -&gt; English[CR]Translation Project[CR]Credits[CR]===============================================[CR]Name:[CR]Akujin[CR]Email: N/A[CR]URL:[CR]N/A[CR]-------------------------------------[CR]Japanese Translator[CR]Name:[CR]David Mullen[CR]Email: makoknight@hotmail.com[CR]URL:[CR]http://www.geocities.com/makoknight.geo[CR]------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Script[CR]Editor, Util/Game testing, various menu translations.[CR]Name: Frank[CR]Hughes/F.H [CR]Email: fh512@yahoo.co.uk[CR]URL:[CR]http://travel.to/fh[CR]-------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Script[CR]extraction/insertion tools,[CR]game code modifications/additions, game[CR]testing, even more delays.[CR]Name: Dark Force / Translator Hunter D :)[CR]Email: darkforce416@hotmail.com[CR]URL:[CR]http://dejap.zsnes.com[CR]-------------------[CR]EUC-JIS table[CR]file.[CR]=====================[CR]What Needs To Be[CR]Done[CR]=====================[CR]Password system needs working on.

If you are using ZSNES to play this game, then you[CR]can simply[CR]place the IPS file in the same directory as your save files,[CR]and ZSNES will[CR]automatically read the patch and apply it, without[CR]changing your original[CR]ROM. The IPS file must be named the same as your[CR]ROM for this to[CR]work.[CR]If you are using another emulator, you will have to patch the[CR]game[CR]manually. IPS.exe and Snestool are two common programs that can[CR]do[CR]this, and they can be found at most emulation and translation[CR]websites.[CR]Before patching your ROM, *always* make sure you keep a backup[CR]copy.[CR]To use IPS.exe, type this at a command prompt:[CR]IPS  [CR]where  is[CR]the name and location of the ROM to be patched, and[CR] is the name and[CR]location of the IPS file to be used.[CR]Snestool has a graphic interface and[CR]doesnt require command line[CR]arguments. After loading it, select the "Use[CR]IPS" option. Then find the[CR]IPS file in the browser window to the left and[CR]select it. After that,[CR]select the ROM that the IPS should be applied[CR]to.[CR]The unpatched file size should be 1049088 bytes. The patched file size[CR]should be 1180160 bytes. Any variation in the patched file size would be[CR]down [CR]to your patching utility and not the IPS file; it would also cause[CR]problems with running the ROM image. PROBLEMS MAY OCCUR USING A MAC[CR]IPS[CR]PATCHING UTIL WHICH MAKES THE ROM ONE BYTE SHORT. WE ARE NOT[CR]RESPONSIBLE[CR]FOR THIS![CR]================[CR]Running the[CR]Game[CR]================[CR]The best medium would be a real 60Hz S-NES (via[CR]back-up unit) displayed[CR]via a RGB SCART cable.[CR]Both snes9x Win and Zsnes[CR]Win seem to competantly handle the[CR]emulation.[CR]==========[CR]Disclaimer[CR]==========[CR]"Alcahest" is (c)1996[CR]by SquareSoft.[CR]This work is unofficial and is not supported by[CR]them.[CR]******** PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING IMPORTANT INFORMATION[CR]***************[CR]This patch may be freely distributed, as long as:[CR] - The[CR]patch remains unmodified (including "retranslations").[CR] Theres been one[CR]case of an overwritten patch of FM where next to no[CR] acknowledgement was[CR]given to our work (without even including[CR] our readme.txt).

See if you can spot their advert[CR]for another of their[CR]products in the game! Despite its rather pedestrian[CR]roots, the game[CR]takes several surprising twists towards the end, and is[CR]generally worth[CR]sticking it out even if the wrap-up (or lack thereof) is a[CR]bit of a let[CR]down. As a note, theres more game past "THE END." Also as a[CR]note, do[CR]set your window speed to "fast" in the in-game options menus -[CR]itll[CR]improve your experience dramatically.[CR]---------------[CR]2.Patch[CR]History[CR]---------------[CR]Working with this game was at times like pulling[CR]teeth, and at others[CR]a blessed breeze. But Im sick of looking at it right[CR]now; its 1:00[CR]in the morning, I have to be at work in eight hours, and I[CR]havent[CR]gotten a good nights sleep in several days.

    <plot>This is kind of a strategy RPG. You have your groups of fighters, represented[CR]by the lead character on the map, and when you attack, the game shifts into[CR]your typical RPG mode, where you can give Attack, Magic, Defend commands and[CR]such. Each group also has its own dragon, which it can control with three[CR]basic commands. The dragons will pretty much do their own thing, until you[CR]tell them to fall back, or stay close, or whatever. Sometimes when your[CR]group's in battle, the dragon will attack first, giving you a nice little[CR]advantage over the enemy. Did that make sense? Also, the game uses terrain in[CR]a very unique way in combat. Terrain isn't just for attack modifiers or[CR]obstacles anymore: worried about the enemy crossing the bridge and taking your[CR]castle? Just use your magic and destroy the bridge. Then you just have to[CR]watch out for any ice magic they may use to freeze the river and make it[CR]passable. Of course, you can always use your fire magic and melt the ice. See[CR]a cluster of enemies in the forest? Burn the forest down with your magic![CR]Sure, it's not environmentally sound, but you can do whatever you want. In[CR]between battles is your typical RPG-style walking around. Talk to your[CR]gigantic cast of characters, check out the shops, sit through the story, stuff[CR]like that. The story doesn't seem that amazing at first, but maybe later on[CR]it'll get more interesting.[CR]Read Me:[CR]Bahamut Lagoon - Translation[CR]Notes by Tomato[CR]---------------------------------------------------[CR] I.[CR]About[CR] --------[CR] Im including a bunch of comments and notes about my[CR]translation of the[CR] text in Bahamut Lagoon for various kinds of people,[CR]including: fellow[CR] game translators, people who are curious about how I[CR]translated BL,[CR] people who like to say good things/bad things about[CR]translations based[CR] on REAL facts (all too often Ill hear things like[CR]"Chrono Trigger[CR] translation sucks, a friend told me so" - which is utter[CR]nonsense).[CR] Be sure to check out my Bahamut Lagoon site at[CR]http://starmen.net/tomato/bahamut for any updates I may make to my[CR]translation notes (and other BL-related stuff).[CR] II. Quick Background[CR]--------------------[CR] Ive translated about 12 or so other games, including[CR]big ones like[CR] Star Ocean and Live-A-Live (although I only did a portion of[CR]the latter).[CR] Ive also translated manga, Japanese TV shows, short stories,[CR]and a novel.[CR] Oh yeah, if anybody in the game/game translating industry is[CR]reading this,[CR] Im looking for a job, so contact me sometime. Of course the[CR]likeliness[CR] of somebody from a real company actually playing this[CR]translation AND[CR] reading this text file is pretty slim, so Ill probably be[CR]selling Slurpees[CR] for the rest of my life.[CR] III. Quick Translation[CR]Overview[CR] -------------------------------[CR] My goal with Bahamut Lagoon[CR]was basically this: To translate stuff better[CR] than a lot of the bland[CR]commercial translations out there, but not as[CR] over-the-top as a lot of the[CR]fan translations turn out. I wanted to be[CR] somewhere in the middle ground.[CR]I dont take too many liberties with the[CR] text, but I do at least try to[CR]make people talk in their own unique ways.[CR] There are going to be lots of[CR]weird sounding parts (the intro to Chapter 15[CR] comes to mind instantly) but[CR]I think most people will really enjoy my[CR] translation decision. At least[CR]that is my hope, anyway.[CR] IV. History[CR] -----------[CR] I wont go into[CR]the messy details and re-open old wounds, but I started[CR] translating BLs[CR]text at the end of May 2001. I finished the initial[CR] translation a few[CR]weeks later, before I jumped onto the Star Ocean[CR] translation. The project[CR]lay dormant for about 5 months after that as a[CR] bunch of stuff happened[CR](mainly real life, Star Ocean, and other projects).[CR] Then, I took up script[CR]editing in late November and early December.[CR] I then took a 2 and a half[CR]month break to translate a book. When I was[CR] done, I went back to finish BL[CR]editing. Because of this long break, there[CR] were a bunch of inconsistencies[CR]in characters style of speech. I think[CR] Ive ironed out most of these, but[CR]if you see anything that seems out of[CR] character, you now know the reason[CR]why.[CR] [CR] I finished script editing in March or April. Altogether, Id say[CR]I easily[CR] put 150 hours, at the very least, into the translation and[CR]editing.[CR] Around this time, Dark Force (from DeJap) was kind enough to take[CR]Neill[CR] Corletts place as the main ASM hacker. He worked 8+ hours per day on[CR]it,[CR] for probably a little over 2 and a half months. We all put in a lot[CR]of[CR] work to get the project to where it is today. And now you are[CR]reading[CR] this.[CR] V. Character Personalities, Etc.[CR]--------------------------------[CR] This section is a little long and[CR]probably boring. But if youre wondering[CR] why some of the text sounds bland[CR]or stiff, that was done on purpose. Both[CR] Sendak and Taicho talk kind of[CR]weird, please refer to them in this list.[CR] This isnt even a complete list[CR]of the characters in the game. Keeping[CR] track of everybody was hard.[CR]Especially after that long break halfway[CR] through editing.[CR] * Byuu -[CR]Heres Byuu, the main character. I dont think he has any[CR] dialogue of his[CR]own, save perhaps for choices youre allowed to[CR] make when responding to[CR]people. I didnt really do much with that[CR] text though, other than making it[CR]sound normal. I had to get each[CR] text choice on its own single line, so[CR]there were 1 or 2 times[CR] where I had to struggle to keep the text sounding[CR]the same as the[CR] original. Just one of those technical issues game[CR]translators[CR] have to live with.[CR] [CR] * Yoyo - Heres Yoyo, the princess[CR]of Kahna, and the so-called "Dragnar".[CR] I actually have a lot to say about[CR]the title "Dragnar", but Ill[CR] talk about that later. Anyway, one of the[CR]weak points of this[CR] games story is definitely in Yoyos character, at least[CR]in my[CR] opinion. Shes just plain stupid, and although thats not a[CR]problem in the plot, her dialogue and stuff was so stupidly[CR] written I[CR]wanna barf. Shes like this mega idiot blonde girl, she[CR] gets kidnapped and[CR]is scared of her powers. I dunno, youll just[CR] have to see for yourself how[CR]uncreative the writers were.[CR] Anyway, I didnt have to try too hard to bring[CR]across her[CR] ditziness. She does talk like a girl though, so I tried to[CR]bring[CR] that forth - but if you ask specifically how that is done, I[CR]cant[CR] answer very well. Not all girls talk similarly in English so I[CR]tried the best I could.[CR] * Palpaleos - Palpaleos is a general of the[CR]Empire, and Emperor Sauzers[CR] best friend. He plays a big part in the plot,[CR]but his[CR] dialogue isnt all that spectacular, and the way he talks[CR] isnt[CR]all that out of the ordinary, so I basically just tried[CR] to make his text[CR]sound natural. Of course, everybody talks[CR] different depending on who[CR]theyre talking to, who else is[CR] with them, etc., so when I say I tried to[CR]make it sound[CR] natural, I mean depending on each situation.[CR] * Sendak -[CR]Sendaks an old man (yes, hes a man for those who have doubts).[CR] Hes kind of[CR]like an old advisor for the king and Yoyo. Being[CR] an old man, he speaks in[CR]a definite old-man manner in the[CR] original Japanese. Its hard to bring that[CR]across in English[CR] without using voices, so I tried to first draw out his[CR]sentences[CR] as much as possible, since old people do tend to ramble on a[CR]lot. Luckily, this fits in with another quirk in his[CR] personality - that he[CR]rambles and complains a lot. He also[CR] talks/thinks to himself a lot. To[CR]help accentuate his[CR] rambliness I decided to not let him use many[CR]contractions in his[CR] speech. Whether or not this was a good idea I dont[CR]know, but I[CR] tried to be consistent at least. I did let him use[CR]contractions[CR] when he was talking to himself though. He seemed very[CR]self[CR] concious and it just seemed fine to have him talk like that.[CR] And[CR]yeah, I dont know whats up with him, he does seem a little[CR] too attached to[CR]Byuu. Ill leave any inferences to the player.[CR] Especially the... one[CR]scene.[CR] * Matelite - Matelite is the head of the knights of Kahna from what[CR]I can[CR] tell. Hes a big loudmouth and rude. These kinds of[CR] personalities[CR]are always fun to try to translate, because its[CR] at least possible in[CR]English translations. In contrast to[CR] Sendak and Taicho, I let Matelite use[CR]lots of contractions and[CR] quicker-sounding speech. Im sure most people wont[CR]notice it[CR] anyway, though. For the most part, the content of his[CR]dialogue[CR] makes up a big part of his personality, the way he says it is[CR]only the icing on the cake. I like to think I did a reasonble[CR] job with[CR]him, though Im sure some would want to disagree.[CR] * Bikkebakke -[CR]Bikkebakke, Rush, and Truce apparently were all just barely[CR] surviving[CR]before Byuu let them into Kahnas dragon squad.[CR] Because theyre so similar[CR]in character and always hanging[CR] around each other, I tried to keep the[CR]styles of all three[CR] pretty close together. And since theyre kind of young[CR]and[CR] not especially intelligent, I try to have them talk kind of[CR] quick,[CR]and with lots of contractions and things like[CR] "gonna".[CR] Bikkebakke[CR]himself looks up to Byuu, almost as kind of an[CR] older brother. He often[CR]refers to Byuu as "aniki" in the[CR] Japanese version, but that shows[CR]familiarity more than[CR] anything else, in this case (IMHO). Because of this[CR]word,[CR] some people who dont know a whole lot of Japanese think[CR]Bikkebakke is Byuus little brother, but this is not true.[CR] Watch out for[CR]people who pretend to know Japanese.[CR] * Rush - Rush hangs around Bikkebakke[CR]and Truce a lot. Hes really[CR] headstrong, and doesnt like to think too much.[CR]Hence the name, I[CR] suppose. Anyway, he reminds me of a hyperactive kid in[CR]his late[CR] teens, so I tried to make him come across as such. Hope it[CR]worked.[CR] * Truce - Truce. It took a lot of time to pin down a good[CR]transliteration[CR] of his katakana name, but I think this is most likely what[CR]it[CR] should be. Ive seen people call him Tulus or Toulouse or Taurus,[CR]but I dont think any of them are quite right.[CR] Truce seems to be the less[CR]hyper of the three, to me at least. I[CR] hope this comes across. Im worried a[CR]lot about inconsistencies[CR] in his language that might creep in. In old, old[CR]versions of the[CR] script he talked a little too stiff. If this is still[CR]anywhere[CR] in the script, itd be in the first few chapters. Hopefully I[CR]eliminated these inconsistencies.[CR] * Taicho - Taicho is/was the captain of[CR]the army of Mahal. Unfortunately[CR] the Empire kicked the crap out of them[CR]and now Taicho is out of[CR] a job, home, and wife.[CR] Taichos dialog style[CR]was difficult to decide on. In the end, I[CR] decided that since hes a[CR]captain, and since he ends everything[CR] with "de arimasu", that I should[CR]make him sound like a[CR] stiff-talking army guy. So his text will sound[CR]really stiff.[CR] Im betting that people who dont realize this purposely-[CR]made[CR] decision of mine will chalk up his stiff-sounding text to a bad[CR]translation/translator and/or bad editing, but they dont know[CR] the[CR]truth.[CR] At any rate, Im concerned the most about Taichos dialog,[CR]because there were some major inconsistencies in his text in[CR] early[CR]chapters in early versions of the script. If he suddenly[CR] starts talking[CR]normal, let me know, because hes not supposed to[CR] sound normal.[CR] One of[CR]the main things that is lost in translation if his text[CR] is his "de[CR]arimasu". Its kind of like his signature "word", but[CR] in translation that[CR]word is lost. Normally that might not be so[CR] important, but there are a few[CR]times when people are making fun[CR] of him, or when hes talking and the game[CR]doesnt tell you hes[CR] talking, you can just tell its him from the "de[CR]arimasu". But[CR] in translation thats gone, so it makes things harder.[CR]Ive[CR] tried my best to keep things working, but this is just one of[CR] the[CR]problems any translator will have to face. I could always[CR] go the Pokemon[CR]route and have him say "Taicho Taicho!!" at the[CR] end of every sentence, but[CR]then I would have a mob and the[CR] flaming torches and the biting and the[CR]kicking... And the[CR] Mini-Devils already talk like that.[CR] * Gunso - Gunso[CR]is a heavy-armor knight under Taicho. He apparently has[CR] some weird[CR]scratching problem - Ill leave any possible reasons[CR] up to the player. I[CR]tried to keep his dialogue between normal[CR] and Taicho-level stiffness. It[CR]varies but not by a whole lot.[CR] * Barclay - Barclay is another heavy-armor[CR]knight under Taichos command.[CR] His text is a little less stiff than Taicho,[CR]because of little[CR] side-story stuff that happens later in the game.[CR] *[CR]Anastasia - Didnt do a whole lot with her character, as she has VERY few[CR]lines in the game. I just made her sound normal.[CR] * Diana - Same as[CR]Anastasia, I didnt do a whole lot with Dianas text.[CR] * Ectarina - Ectarina[CR]seems like a shy girl, and very unstable. So I tried[CR] to bring that[CR]forth.[CR] * Frederica - She seems to be way too hooked on medicine. I tried[CR]to at[CR] least make her sound like it, although in reality I didnt[CR] have[CR]to do much.[CR] * Joy - Um, theres not a whole lot to say about her. She[CR]serves the queen[CR] of Campbell, so when she DOES talk I try to make her[CR]sound elegant[CR] and/or official, but she doesnt talk a whole lot.[CR] *[CR]Melodia - Melodia is a little girl. Its pretty easy to make people[CR] sound[CR]like little kids, because we have little-kid talk in[CR] English too.She hangs[CR]around the Mini-Devils a lot, and in a[CR] way she even looks kind of like[CR]them (not so much in battle[CR] though). I think I did okay with her text,[CR]though there might[CR] be a few places where I could have made her sound more[CR]kid-like[CR] than I did.[CR] * Nelbo - Just like Joy, Nelbo serves the queen[CR]of Campbell, and as such I[CR] tried to make her fit that character in her[CR]dialogue. Of which[CR] there is VERY little of.[CR] Anyway, Nelbo = :) IMO[CR]* Zora - Zoras an older woman, and I guess she serves Princess Yoyo. She[CR]isnt all that graceful or anything, and shes pretty rough. She[CR] yells at[CR]people a lot, not to mention occasional physical[CR] violence. I tried to[CR]bring this coarseness out. Shes a mother of[CR] one of the other characters,[CR]so I tried to make her sound like a[CR] strict, middle-aged mother.[CR] *[CR]Lukia - Lukia is a light armor knight. Shes kind of playful in a[CR] kissy-[CR]kissy sort of way. I think you know what I mean. Anyway she[CR] also seems[CR]like a big loudmouth to me so I tried to put that into[CR] her dialogue.[CR] *[CR]Jeanne - I dont know a whole lot about Jeanne, but people mention shes[CR]sort of tomboyish in the game, so I tried to make her sound like[CR] that.[CR]* Mist - Shes constantly bragging about her good looks and talking to[CR]herself about how beautiful she is. I didnt do too much with[CR] her. Shes[CR]also a secret character, for those who are paying[CR] attention.[CR] * Reeve -[CR]Reeve is a Lancer. Together with his friend Frenze, he does a[CR] lot of[CR]showing off of his lancing skills. I had a hard time[CR] figuring out what to[CR]name him and Frenze, but these seemed the[CR] best.[CR] * Frenze - Frenzes[CR]name was hard to figure out too. In the end Im glad I[CR] chose this one, its[CR]short and isnt too funky. Character-wise,[CR] hes just like Reeve, so theres[CR]not much to say.[CR] * Donfan - Donfan was my favorite character to work on.[CR]Translating his[CR] text was hell, but making it sound good was real fun. Im[CR]sure[CR] most people will agree a lot of his scenes throw in a lot of[CR]much-needed humor to break up the over-dramatic monotony of the[CR] story.[CR]Maybe itll make some people laugh out loud even. Id[CR] be real happy if it[CR]did.[CR] Anyway, the first thing I should point out that his name in[CR]Japanese can be seen as a rendition of "Don Juan". He certainly[CR] fits the[CR]character, sort of. The reason I chose Donfan was[CR] two-fold: that was what[CR]I called him from the start, and[CR] changing his name later on would suck,[CR]and the name "Don Juan"[CR] doesnt fit too well in this game, in English, IMO.[CR]Of course,[CR] calling him Donfan isnt exactly wrong either, its a[CR]perfectly[CR] allowable rendition of his katakana name. In the end its[CR]just[CR] a choice the translator will have to make, and I chose Donfan.[CR] I[CR]think most people will like this one better. And if not, they[CR] should stick[CR]bananas in their ears.[CR] I tried to make his speech really wild and corny. I[CR]hope people[CR] appreciate his text style. My only concerns are that maybe[CR]early in the game his style will be slightly inconsistent with[CR] his style[CR]later in the game. Ill hopefully have had that fixed[CR] up by the final[CR]patch.[CR] Also theres his trademark line, its a bugger to translate.[CR] Ah[CR]well. Im pretty sure my translation of "such is the way of[CR] the world" is[CR]WRONG. Im fairly certain "thats what Im here[CR] for" or "thats my job" is[CR]closer. But I think Ill keep it as[CR] is until I can take a break and look at[CR]it again with clearer[CR] eyes. If that makes sense at all.[CR] * Zoras Son -[CR]Zoras Son doesnt give his name (right away), probably[CR] because having Zora[CR]for his mother really screwed him up in[CR] the head. Character-wise, he seems[CR]like a kind of innocent[CR] guy who had the unfortunate luck of having a real[CR]monster of[CR] a woman for a mother. So hes kind of timid, and I tried to[CR]put that into his text.[CR] * Manyo - Manyo is one of the Mini-Devils. Theres[CR]not a whole lot to say[CR] except these guys are weird. I think theyre really[CR]into death[CR] and praying to gods of death and stuff. Actually you dont[CR]know[CR] about that until maybe midway of the game. When I got to that[CR]text I was like, "WTF." Anyway, my only decision was how to make[CR] the text[CR]in parentheses sound - should I make it sound weird,[CR] like caveman talk, or[CR]just normal, like normal subtitles? In the[CR] end I chose to do a little of[CR]both.[CR] * Monyo - See above. Nothing special here.[CR] * Munyo - See above[CR]again. Bleh.[CR] * Wagahai - Wagahais a Mini-Devil who thinks he/she is better[CR]than the[CR] others. Im not quite sure about a couple lines this[CR] Mini-[CR]Devil says inside the ship (youll see what I mean, I need[CR] to analyze those[CR]lines more), but this Mini-Devil is definitely[CR] proud. So the other Mini-[CR]Devils eventually get fed up with it,[CR] and then.... youll just have to play[CR];)[CR] * Sajin - Sajin is a ninja-for-hire. He doesnt say a whole lot, so[CR]I[CR] didnt put a whole lot of effort into making him his own style.[CR] *[CR]Zeroshin - Zeroshin is another ninja-for-hire. Hes extremely shy, and[CR]always writing letters back to his mother. I didnt need to[CR] do much with[CR]his text, the content of his text speaks for[CR] itself most of the time.[CR]VI. Naming[CR] ----------[CR] People like to think that translating non-[CR]dialogue stuff is real easy.[CR] Like translating item names, monster names,[CR]etc. Theyre actually MUCH[CR] harder than dialogue. It just seems easier to[CR]beginners because theyre[CR] single words. But a lot of items, spells,[CR]monsters, and the like are[CR] made-up names, or names based slighly off a[CR]real word, but arent real[CR] words themselves. Or, names which are originally[CR]neither Japanese nor[CR] English. BL had a lot of these words. There was a bit[CR]of German influence[CR] on this game. A lot of items and enemies were based[CR]off of World War I and[CR] II terminology. Others were of historical and[CR]religious significance,[CR] which I also had to research.[CR] A lot of work[CR]went into figuring out these item names. But there were a[CR] few lost causes.[CR]In these cases, I tried to come up with a good equivalent[CR] that would make[CR]sense to English speakers. So if anybody wants to complain[CR] about how I[CR]named things, you cant say I didnt put a lot of work into it.[CR] But I make[CR]mistakes too, so if I did make any, please let me know.[CR] Somebody once came[CR]up to me and said that all the character names in BL[CR] were supposed to[CR]represent who they are. For example, Rush. His name[CR] sort of signifies who[CR]he is. Also, theres Taicho, which literally is a[CR] sort of military[CR]commander, and Gunso, which is literally a sergeant.[CR] So this person also[CR]pointed out that the main character should be called[CR] "View" not "Byuu",[CR]since he gets to "view" all that happens in the game.[CR] I dont buy this.[CR]What about Sendak? Matelite? Palpaleos? Just doesnt[CR] work. But I thought Id[CR]throw this in for people to ponder over.[CR] Some of the chapter titles are[CR]kind of corny/weird, but Im not going to[CR] change them just because they[CR]sound weird. The one I have the most problem[CR] with is "Full of Regret". I[CR]should probably have translated it some other[CR] way, because "regret" doesnt[CR]seem to be the right word in this context.[CR] The title comes from a line[CR]Matelite says in the chapter, but again, regret[CR] doesnt seem to be quite[CR]the right word. But it still makes sense overall.[CR] Many of the default[CR]dragon names are slightly different. Byuus dragon is[CR] Salamander in the[CR]original, but that doesnt fit in 8 characters, so we[CR] dropped it down to[CR]Salmando. Icedrake was originally Icedragon. Thundera[CR] or whatever we[CR]called it was originally Thunder Hawk. What we have as[CR] Molten would[CR]probably sound best as Morten, IMO, but that was one of the[CR] things I[CR]conceded to DF. His reason for calling it Molten was because it[CR] would be[CR]the fourth element earth since the other 3 fire/thunder/water were[CR] used on[CR]the other dragons. The flagships name was originally Fahrenheit,[CR] but we[CR]had to make it fit within 8 characters, so now its Farnheit. You[CR] can[CR]always change these names to whatever you like; you get to name your[CR]dragons and your ship near the beginning of the game.[CR] In regard to[CR]"Dragnar", let me say this. From the katakana, Dragnar is the[CR] most likely[CR]English spelling. I used it in all my early scripts. I didnt[CR] like it very[CR]much, so I changed it to "Dragoner" in an edited script,[CR] mainly because[CR]other groups were calling it different things, and because[CR] people on[CR]message boards were calling it by that too. But after a while,[CR] I changed[CR]my mind again, and put it back to Dragnar. Id rather choose a[CR] name because[CR]of what the game says and what I think than because of outside[CR] influences.[CR]So now its "Dragnar" again. Plus, it has that sort of exotic[CR] feel that the[CR]original Japanese word has. Dragoner just doesnt sound all[CR] that[CR]exotic.[CR] Some item names were practically impossible to translate. The[CR]biggest[CR] culprit is "Drawer Thing", which is the closest rendition I think[CR]anybody[CR] can really make. Its a "thing" in a "you-know-what" type of sense,[CR]at[CR] least thats the originals meaning. "an item from a drawer - you[CR]know[CR] what it is." Another is Uniuji - I dont think this is "Sea Urchin[CR]Grub"[CR] but just another made up name. "Uni" shows up a lot in this game, so[CR]I[CR] think Uniuji is just another extension of that.[CR] VII. Editing[CR]------------[CR] I did all of the dialogue editing myself. So if it sucks,[CR]blame me. Dark[CR] Force helped to do some of the in-battle text, map[CR]dialogue, and other[CR] little things. I didnt always agree 100% with his[CR]decisions, but Im still[CR] very happy with how things turned out.[CR] Editing[CR]took me probably 2 months total. I wrote a custom text previewer[CR]application (which was pretty sucky), and went through every single line[CR]of text to make sure the text was formatted correctly. If it wasnt[CR]formatted correctly, the game would crash and it wouldnt work. Theres a[CR]slight chance there may be a line or two in the game that will overflow[CR]the box and freeze up the game, but if there are any of those lines, I[CR]must[CR] have missed them in my testing.[CR] Since the game is so linear, I[CR]went through each chapter and edited the[CR] text as I played. I would edit a[CR]chapters text, insert it into the game,[CR] try it out, then re-edit and[CR]reformat to sound better. I would then test[CR] this newer text and re-edit it[CR]again. I did this time after time after time,[CR] for each and every chapter.[CR]I played the game so much it was disgusting.[CR] VIII. Miscellaneous[CR]-------------------[CR] To answer one of the most-likely questions: Yes, the[CR]game is that perverted[CR] in the original version. I made sure not to go[CR]overboard, but I made sure[CR] not to be too cautious.[CR] Speaking of[CR]cautious, one of the big changes I was *going* to make was with[CR] the word[CR]"drug" that appears all throughout the game. In English, the first[CR] thing[CR]that word brings out is "illegal narcotic", which is not exactly how[CR] it is[CR]in Japanese. Because of this cultural difference, I was going to[CR] change[CR]all the instances of "drug" to different things like "Tonic", "Heal",[CR] etc.[CR]so that they would make sense in context. I can just see the little,[CR]immature teenagers making bad jokes and giggling about items like[CR] "High[CR]Drug" or "White Drug" or "Drug Hit" or "Heal Grass" or whatever else[CR] there[CR]is. In the end, though, I just decided, screw that, Im not gonna[CR] change[CR]it, people would just call the translation sucky if I changed it,[CR] and itd[CR]just take more time which I can spend sleeping.[CR] Originally the font was[CR]the same one as in Neills SD3 translation, but[CR] since this game looks so[CR]much like FF6, I wanted to go with FF3uss font.[CR] I had to slightly modify a[CR]few of the larger characters, like w and m,[CR] but in the end it looks real[CR]slick. Very professional looking.[CR] For those people who like to play games[CR]a zillion times and find all the[CR] smallest secrets, check out the checklist[CR]at my BL page. It lists[CR] some hard-to-find stuff, some of which is stuff we[CR]added and/or slightly[CR] changed (changed is such a harsh word).[CR] As for[CR]"Holy Dragons", this was a difficult decision. Certainly, these[CR] dragons[CR]are not of a holy nature. Dragon Gods was another possibility, but[CR] it just[CR]didnt seem quite right to me. Divine Dragons was another choice,[CR] but that[CR]sounds pretty funky, to me at least. It was a hard decision but I[CR] chose[CR]Holy Dragons in the end, because I had to choose *something*.[CR] IX. End[CR]-------[CR] Thats all for my little BL translation notes file. Im sure Ill[CR]think of[CR] stuff to add to it later, so if youre one of the weird geeks who[CR]has read[CR] this far, and you happen to be interested in this kind of stuff,[CR]check out[CR] my BL page at http://starmen.net/tomato/bahamut. If I ever want[CR]to update[CR] the translation notes, Ill do it there. I also have a[CR]complete[CR] walkthrough with screenshots, helpful tips, and explanations on[CR]how to get[CR] secret stuff at that site, not to mention lots of pics,[CR]downloads, and[CR] other stuff. So check it out sometime.[CR] X. Personal[CR]Thanks[CR] ------------------[CR] Too many people to thank. Neill Corlett[CR](http://lfx.org/~corlett), Dark[CR] Force, all my Japanese sensei and friends[CR]in Japan who helped me out with[CR] learning the language. reidman, and all[CR]the cool people at Starmen.Net. All[CR] the cool people over at MOs[CR]translation board, koitsu for pulling off that[CR] awesome April Fools joke[CR](you had me tricked for about 0.5 seconds, it was[CR] the lawyer name that[CR]gave it away big time), the people at the BL GameFaqs[CR] board who helped me[CR]with some info when I needed it, the authors of some[CR] Japanese BL pages[CR]which dont exist any longer, Summon Illusion, Zalagren,[CR] iMoose, and Square[CR](for the cool game, and for hopefully hiring me. Right???[CR] Come on. ;)[CR]NO thanks to all the "gimme BL now", "WHAT UP WITH BAHUMAT" kiddies who[CR]have pestered me for an entire year. "If youre translating BL why arent[CR]you letting people download it? youre a stupid liar" My answer to that is:[CR]I wasnt letting people download it because it wasnt done yet. Idiots.[CR] Now[CR]go play the game and stop reading my boring crap.[CR] -Tomato[CR](http://starmen.net/tomato)[CR] May 31,[CR]2002[CR]=============================================================================[CR]=============================================================================[CR]Bahamut[CR]Lagoon - Technical Notes by Dark[CR]Force[CR]----------------------------------------------[CR] Reprogramming[CR]-------------[CR] Originally, I only wanted to help out Neill finish his work[CR]on BL, I did[CR] not plan on taking over the entire project. It quickly became[CR]clear that[CR] Neill had no interest in finishing BL on his own or even with[CR]help, and so[CR] my interest in BL diminished as well. It was only when Tomato[CR]consistently[CR] began to persuade me to work on it and when the other groups[CR]began[CR] announcing their BL projects, that I decided to actually help.[CR]Initially, I was impressed by the work Neill had done with the 13x13 and[CR]8x8 variable width fonts and the dialogue script, thinking those would[CR]make[CR] my job really easy. Neill had done 3 of the 12x12 variable width[CR]fonts and[CR] one of the 8x8 variable width fonts, as well as the dialogue[CR]replacement[CR] and recompression. I never would have imagined how much was[CR]left to be done.[CR] Neill didnt know it at the time and neither did I, but he[CR]had only[CR] scratched the surface. And to make things worse, Tomato wanted[CR]EVERYTHING[CR] in a variable width font! So, reluctantly, I complied. It was a[CR]challenge[CR] to find enough VRAM space to hold all of the vwf text, like[CR]hacking the[CR] inventory screen, for example.[CR] Seeing the finished[CR]product, however, I think it was worth it. The game[CR] feels more like a psx[CR]game than an snes game, as I dont remember any other[CR] snes game or[CR]translation having a dynamic variable width 8x8 font (except[CR] for Front[CR]Mission which used one, I dont know if it used it everywhere or[CR] not). It[CR]was so nice not having to abbreviate item names and not truncating[CR] text,[CR]forcing it to sound bad. It makes the whole translation that much[CR] more[CR]friendly and enjoyable.[CR] Eventually I think this will affect future[CR]translations to do full 8x8 vwf[CR] hacks (which are much harder than 16x16[CR]vwf hacks). I know Bongo is already[CR] implementing one for his current[CR]project and Im thinking of doing one for[CR] Star Ocean. Kammedos BL patch[CR]also uses a variable width 8x8 font, but[CR] that was only after Neill tried[CR]adding one first.[CR] This game is by far one of the ugliest Ive worked on,[CR]especially when[CR] adding an 8x8 vwf. There are so many inconsistencies,[CR]hundreds of hardcoded[CR] pointers, dialogue scripts embedded in 2 separate[CR]scripting languages,[CR] individual text strings spread out all over the damn[CR]rom, every different[CR] kind of pointer system possible, at least 5 different[CR]fonts and routines to[CR] display them, which all look the same on screen![CR]Some of the fonts were[CR] identical when decompressed, yet were compressed[CR]with different routines. I[CR] often became quite sick of all the[CR]inconsistencies and stupidities in this[CR] game and can only imagine it was[CR]written by 5 separate teams who never[CR] spoke to each other and kept adding[CR]more features as hacks rather than[CR] including them into the game[CR]engine.[CR] After its all said and done, I can take pride in the work we did[CR]on this[CR] game. As far as the hacking goes I think its the best looking job[CR]Ive[CR] done to date, and Neill gets half the credit for that. Also, Tomatos[CR]12x12[CR] font makes the dialogue very easy to read. Its similar to my ToP[CR]font but[CR] his looks much better.[CR] Visualization[CR] -------------[CR] As[CR]with with other translations, I spent a lot of effort on redesigning the[CR]various screens and repositioning text and cursors to make the most[CR]effective use of space while still keeping the screens pretty and easy to[CR]read. The tech names were a bit too long in some places which cause some[CR]cramming, and one screen where there is a problem with space is the[CR]formation sub-screen, but overall they look great. I could have made more[CR]room by expanding the window borders right to the edges of the screen, but[CR]then the screen would appear cut off if the game was played on a TV screen[CR]instead of an emulator, and I intend to play it on my TV.[CR] I took some[CR]liberties along the way, improving some screens where I thought[CR] the[CR]original game needed improvement. Below is a list of modifications that[CR]changed the game from its original design:[CR] - Added variable width fonts[CR]everywhere[CR] * This will cause noticible slow down on some screens (such as[CR]item lists)[CR] compared to the Japanese version and you can even see it[CR]redrawing in[CR] some situations. For this reason, there is a separate patch[CR]for[CR] emulators which will reduce all the slowness. The emulator patch,[CR]however, will not work properly on a copier.[CR] - Inventory Menu Screen[CR] *[CR]I moved the 2 item columns as close together as I could to fit the[CR] longest[CR]item name. The right column is actually a bit wider than the[CR] left column,[CR]but its almost impossible to notice unless you have the[CR] same item name on[CR]both columns, which is also impossible.[CR] * The original text at the bottom[CR]read "Dragon Keepers Item Explanation",[CR] which sounded bad and was too long[CR]to fit with the vwf so I changed it[CR] to "Inventory / Item Details" because[CR]that sounds closer to what you can view[CR] and there are two separate screens[CR]accessible from that one menu option.[CR] * I made the regular item icons[CR]variable width, meaning you may notice[CR] that first letter of light armor[CR]items and heavy armor items do not[CR] line up.[CR] * For the item details I[CR]used up and down arrows to show status changes.[CR] - Dragons Menu Screen[CR]* I changed the dragon status attributes (at the botton of the screen)[CR]from font text to colorized icons drawn by CPF, which I think work much[CR]better especially given the limited room on that screen.[CR] - Formation Sub-[CR]Menu Screen[CR] * I moved around some text to make more room for tech lists,[CR]so a couple[CR] long item names (weapons/armor) overflow on to the next line.[CR]I dont[CR] care enough to fix it and its only on a small number of items[CR]so[CR] chances are you wont notice it, plus theres no more room to move it[CR]around anyways.[CR] - All Menu Status Screens[CR] * I chose not to use the[CR]variable width font for HP/MP/SP/LV/NEXT/EXP[CR] because I felt they were more[CR]important and I wanted them to stick out.[CR] * I also chose not to use the[CR]vwf for PARTY and PAGE for the same reason.[CR] * I chose to leave TIME as[CR]fixed width because its always directly followed[CR] by numbers which are also[CR]fixed width. It would look strange to mix the[CR] two font types together[CR]here.[CR] - Item Descriptions on Menu Screens[CR] * There is no shadow on the[CR]12x12 variable width font used for descriptions.[CR] Neill did this one and he[CR]didnt included a shadow, reason being its[CR] really nasty since the font is[CR]displayed using sprites. I dont blame[CR] him and it doesnt bother me enough[CR]to try and add a shadow to it.[CR] - All Money Screens[CR] * I chose to use PR[CR]instead of Piro (the games currency) because its[CR] more in line with using[CR]GP like Square does in its English translations.[CR] - Naming Screen[CR] * I[CR]completely redesigned this, instead of trying to reuse the Japanese[CR]layout. The result is it looks like a naming screen should be, instead[CR] of[CR]a hacked up Japanese one. The name cursor is also repositioned on a[CR] pixel[CR]basis, to accomodate the variable width font for the name.[CR] - Load/Save[CR]Game Screen[CR] * I expanded the 12x12 chapter names to print on two lines[CR]instead of one,[CR] because I didnt want to truncate any of Tomatos[CR]translations. Theres[CR] one small bug as a result but I dont care since this[CR]screen looks[CR] amazing the way it is now.[CR] - Title Screen[CR] * I fixed[CR]the "Temporally Play" graphic to read "Temporary Play",[CR] silly[CR]Square...[CR] * I Added our custom logos beside the Square logo.[CR] - Sound[CR]Menu Screen[CR] * Neill added a hidden jukebox (sound test) to the game. The[CR]names used[CR] in the track titles of the songs dont correspond to the[CR]spelling[CR] Tomato used in the dialogue, this is because the track titles[CR]were taken[CR] from an OST cd (I think) but werent necessarily correct, but we[CR]will[CR] still honor them. For example, they had Zauzer instead of Sauzer.[CR]- Dragon Feeding Screen[CR] * I changed how the dragon class was displayed[CR]slightly, by adding a cell[CR] separator instead of appending it with a[CR]slash.[CR] * I made the Loyalty/Fidelity statuses always visible, which the[CR]game[CR] originally hid unless you had an Uni Uni dragon; I think theyre[CR]useful[CR] to see at all times.[CR] * I also changed the graphics/text for[CR]Loyalty/Fidelity from ? and ??[CR] to letters of the status they actually[CR]represent.[CR] - Dragon Transformation[CR] * When the dragon transforms, I[CR]went as far as making it display a or[CR] an when it says "Transformed into[CR]a[n] xxx dragon.", instead of taking[CR] the cheap way out and saying "Became[CR]xxx dragon".[CR] - In-Battle Screens[CR] * I added pixel-centering for the[CR]magic/attack names and descriptions.[CR] * For the battle dialogue I forced it[CR]to be not centered (unlike the[CR] original game) because I felt centered[CR]dialogue didnt look right.[CR] * I also allowed the battle dialogue to have[CR]multiple lines of text,[CR] instead of just one line in the original.[CR] * I[CR]made the colorized item icons display instead of the standard vwf[CR] icons.[CR]This isnt really a change from the original, but Im listing it[CR] so that[CR]people dont think its a bug on our part: there is an icon that[CR] looks like[CR]a bomb in battle which is appears as a pot on the status[CR] screens. Thats[CR]what the original game did so Im keeping it the same[CR] way.[CR] * The[CR]character select window I shortened because it was longer than it[CR] needed[CR]to be now that we were using a variable width font for the names.[CR] * I[CR]removed the ":" after the element/status icons for enemies because it[CR]seemed completely useless to me.[CR] * For when a spell or item fails, I[CR]replaced the "Fail" word in Japanese[CR] with a "Fail!" graphic in English,[CR]but I dont know if thats the best[CR] word to use.. maybe "Miss!" or "Missed!"[CR]?[CR] - After-Battle Screens[CR] * I changed the colors of "Exp" and "Lv Up!".[CR]The game originally meant[CR] to display Exp in a different color, but because[CR]of a palette bug on[CR] their part, it showed up as white. When I fixed that[CR]and "Exp" showed[CR] up in yellow, "Lv Up!" looked strange also in yellow, so[CR]I changed it[CR] to the next available color which was orange.[CR] * I removed[CR]the "+" sign from the amount of exp gained after battle.[CR] - Main[CR]Dialogue[CR] * There are a few strings that contain hidden references to[CR]ourselves,[CR] one of them tells you how to access the jukebox.[CR] -[CR]Map/Field Dialogue[CR] * The scenario objective is now pixel-centered.[CR] *[CR]When drowning, it displays the message "Will drown in x turn[s].", I[CR] made[CR]the "s" in "turns" only display if there is more than 1 turn left,[CR] instead[CR]of taking the cheap way out and saying "turn(s)".[CR] * The only string we[CR]didnt find was "Dragon evolved into xxx", when a[CR] dragon evolves on the[CR]field. If anyone gets this to happen, please send[CR] us a savestate, you will[CR]probably see garbage text on the screen.[CR] - Map/Field Menus[CR] * For spell[CR]details, I drew range and radius icons instead of using text.[CR] * For the[CR]terrain window, I replaced the 12x12 font with an 8x8 variable[CR] width font[CR]and pixel-centered the terrain type (Tomatos idea).[CR] * For the main menus,[CR]I used different idents/cursor positions depending[CR] if the field menu or[CR]attack menu or dragon menu is being displayed,[CR] in an effort to make the[CR]text in the menu look centered. It works most[CR] of the time but not[CR]always.[CR] - Intro/End Credits[CR] * Fixed Squares spelling mistakes[CR]("designner") and added us to the[CR] credits.[CR] Editing[CR] -------[CR]Like Tomato said, I helped with the editing for map and battle dialogue,[CR]so[CR] dont complain to him if the text isnt exactly what was said in[CR]Japanese.[CR] I wanted to make the text sound more elaborate rather than using[CR]the lame[CR] incomplete phrases that existed in Japanese. For example, [CR]original text: "Lestat: I havent started yet!",[CR] my edit: "Lestat: I still[CR]have a full deck up my sleeve!" (talking about[CR] showing his potential in[CR]battle); or, [CR] original text: "Sauzer: The Holy Dragons power... It is a[CR]terrifying power!",[CR] my edit: "Sauzer: The power of the Holy Dragons[CR]commands such malevolence..."[CR] Thats not exactly what youd call literal[CR]translations. I know Tomato wanted[CR] to keep to the original scripts while[CR]still trying to make them sound good,[CR] but in this case I didnt think that[CR]would work, and I wanted to have some fun[CR] with those scripts as well. The[CR]only reason I chose to edit them was because[CR] I was sick of hacking at this[CR]point.[CR] Retranslations[CR] --------------[CR] Anyone who wants to translate[CR]BL to their own language, DO NOT CONTACT US AND[CR] DO NOT RIP OFF OUR PATCH![CR]We will plan on working on multilingual BL[CR] translations when were ready.[CR]In the mean time, Kammedo is probably more able[CR] to help with translating[CR]BL to other languages, I think hes already planning[CR] one for German. There[CR]is also a group that already has a BL patch in French[CR] that could also help[CR]you with another language translation. Theres also a[CR] Thai translation[CR]group that has made a decent BL patch.[CR] -Dark Force[CR](http://www.dejap.com)[CR] May 31, 2002[CR] Whats New[CR] ----------[CR]VERSION 1.3:[CR] * Fixed all the crashing that happened. This was because of a[CR]simple[CR] missing % sign in the main script. The game now runs fine. Weve re-[CR]tested[CR] the entire game and no crashes were to be found. If the game[CR]crashes,[CR] then you likely have a bad ROM.[CR] * Fixed a few aesthetical[CR]things in the script.[CR] * Fixed that fireworks graphical glitch for[CR]good.[CR] VERSION 1.2:[CR] * The checksum has been fixed. So if you apply this[CR]patch and your emulator[CR] says the checksum is bad, it means your original[CR]ROM was corrupt. Look[CR] elsewhere for the ROM. WE WILL NOT SEND ONE TO YOU[CR]OR TELL YOU WHERE TO[CR] GET ONE. If, after you apply the patch, the checksum[CR]is OK, then you have[CR] a good version of the ROM.[CR] * Fixed instances in[CR]the script that might have frozen the game if you[CR] renamed a main character[CR]to a long name. This will fix the problems that[CR] a few people had in[CR]Chapters 6, 12, and 15.[CR] * Also fixed some spelling and text consistency[CR]issues. Fixed a few item[CR] and dragon class names, as well.[CR] * Re-edited[CR]a bit of the map dialogue text and other map messages.[CR] * Fixed the dragon[CR]evolution line on the map scene. Thanks to all who[CR] provided us with save[CR]states.[CR] Known Issues[CR] ------------[CR] * Zsnes 1.337 WIN has a bug[CR]during battle where the message window appears[CR] in the middle of the screen[CR]after an attack fails. THIS IS NOT OUR[CR] PROBLEM! This will be remedied in[CR]future versions of ZSNES.[CR] [CR] * Load/save game screen: garbage text[CR]appears at bottom of screen momentarily[CR] when saving a game.[CR] * Long[CR]item names on formation sub-screen overflow onto the next line.[CR] * There is[CR]a version of the ROM out there that gets your party members to[CR] Level 99[CR]instantly. This is a bad ROM. THIS IS NOT OUR PROBLEM! There are[CR] also[CR]versions of the ROM that are corrupt and will cause the game to[CR] reset[CR]randomly or just mess up in weird ways.[CR] * If you use cheat codes, the game[CR]may suddenly reset on you at anytime.[CR] Use cheat codes at your own[CR]risk.[CR] ! If anyone notices any other bugs, please report them to us.[CR]Bug when using the patch on a COPIER ONLY[CR]-----------------------------------------[CR] When viewing the list of items[CR]in battle or during dragon feeding, the item[CR] names may show garbage text.[CR]To get around this problem, select any item in[CR] the list as if you were[CR]about to use it, then press the B button to cancel[CR] and return to the item[CR]list. When you return to the list, the item names[CR] will be properly[CR]displayed.[CR] Patching Help[CR] -------------[CR] For the first time, we are[CR]not providing any support for using this patch.[CR] We didnt spend all these[CR]months translating this game only to be barraged[CR] by questions on how to[CR]apply the patch. If you havent figured it out by[CR] now, the DeJap forum is[CR]the place to ask these questions. Click on the[CR] Forum icon at the top of[CR]the DeJap homepage (the link has been fixed), but[CR] for lazy people, the URL[CR]is http://board.zsnes.com/index.php?board=6 .[CR] Make sure to read the topics[CR]at the very top of the board; the answers you[CR] need will most likely be[CR]there already.[CR] Credits[CR] -------[CR] All Translations...........:[CR]Tomato[CR] All Programming/Hacking....: Neill, Dark Force[CR] 12x12 VWF[CR]Font.............: Tomato[CR] 8x8 VWF Font...............: Neill[CR] 16x16[CR]Status Icons.........: CPF[CR] 8x8 Naming Font............: CPF[CR] All Main[CR]Dialogue Editing..: Tomato[CR] Non Main Dialogue Editing..: Tomato, Dark[CR]Force[CR] Testing....................: Tomato, Dark Force, Neill[CR] Special[CR]Thanks to (for technical assistance):[CR] Neill, Bongo, Kammedo, F.H[CR]Special Thanks to (for other):[CR] iMoose, zalagren, Summon Illusion, MO, Shih[CR]Tzu, Major Damage, animesou,[CR] didalos, katharsis</plot>

    <plot>This is kind of a strategy RPG. You have your groups of fighters, represented[CR]by the lead character on the map, and when you attack, the game shifts into[CR]your typical RPG mode, where you can give Attack, Magic, Defend commands and[CR]such. Each group also has its own dragon, which it can control with three[CR]basic commands. The dragons will pretty much do their own thing, until you[CR]tell them to fall back, or stay close, or whatever. Sometimes when your[CR]group's in battle, the dragon will attack first, giving you a nice little[CR]advantage over the enemy. Did that make sense? Also, the game uses terrain in[CR]a very unique way in combat. Terrain isn't just for attack modifiers or[CR]obstacles anymore: worried about the enemy crossing the bridge and taking your[CR]castle? Just use your magic and destroy the bridge. Then you just have to[CR]watch out for any ice magic they may use to freeze the river and make it[CR]passable. Of course, you can always use your fire magic and melt the ice. See[CR]a cluster of enemies in the forest? Burn the forest down with your magic![CR]Sure, it's not environmentally sound, but you can do whatever you want. In[CR]between battles is your typical RPG-style walking around. Talk to your[CR]gigantic cast of characters, check out the shops, sit through the story, stuff[CR]like that. The story doesn't seem that amazing at first, but maybe later on[CR]it'll get more interesting.[CR]Read Me:[CR]Bahamut Lagoon - Translation[CR]Notes by Tomato[CR]---------------------------------------------------[CR] I.[CR]About[CR] --------[CR] Im including a bunch of comments and notes about my[CR]translation of the[CR] text in Bahamut Lagoon for various kinds of people,[CR]including: fellow[CR] game translators, people who are curious about how I[CR]translated BL,[CR] people who like to say good things/bad things about[CR]translations based[CR] on REAL facts (all too often Ill hear things like[CR]"Chrono Trigger[CR] translation sucks, a friend told me so" - which is utter[CR]nonsense).[CR] Be sure to check out my Bahamut Lagoon site at[CR]http://starmen.net/tomato/bahamut for any updates I may make to my[CR]translation notes (and other BL-related stuff).[CR] II. Quick Background[CR]--------------------[CR] Ive translated about 12 or so other games, including[CR]big ones like[CR] Star Ocean and Live-A-Live (although I only did a portion of[CR]the latter).[CR] Ive also translated manga, Japanese TV shows, short stories,[CR]and a novel.[CR] Oh yeah, if anybody in the game/game translating industry is[CR]reading this,[CR] Im looking for a job, so contact me sometime. Of course the[CR]likeliness[CR] of somebody from a real company actually playing this[CR]translation AND[CR] reading this text file is pretty slim, so Ill probably be[CR]selling Slurpees[CR] for the rest of my life.[CR] III. Quick Translation[CR]Overview[CR] -------------------------------[CR] My goal with Bahamut Lagoon[CR]was basically this: To translate stuff better[CR] than a lot of the bland[CR]commercial translations out there, but not as[CR] over-the-top as a lot of the[CR]fan translations turn out. I wanted to be[CR] somewhere in the middle ground.[CR]I dont take too many liberties with the[CR] text, but I do at least try to[CR]make people talk in their own unique ways.[CR] There are going to be lots of[CR]weird sounding parts (the intro to Chapter 15[CR] comes to mind instantly) but[CR]I think most people will really enjoy my[CR] translation decision. At least[CR]that is my hope, anyway.[CR] IV. History[CR] -----------[CR] I wont go into[CR]the messy details and re-open old wounds, but I started[CR] translating BLs[CR]text at the end of May 2001. I finished the initial[CR] translation a few[CR]weeks later, before I jumped onto the Star Ocean[CR] translation. The project[CR]lay dormant for about 5 months after that as a[CR] bunch of stuff happened[CR](mainly real life, Star Ocean, and other projects).[CR] Then, I took up script[CR]editing in late November and early December.[CR] I then took a 2 and a half[CR]month break to translate a book. When I was[CR] done, I went back to finish BL[CR]editing. Because of this long break, there[CR] were a bunch of inconsistencies[CR]in characters style of speech. I think[CR] Ive ironed out most of these, but[CR]if you see anything that seems out of[CR] character, you now know the reason[CR]why.[CR] [CR] I finished script editing in March or April. Altogether, Id say[CR]I easily[CR] put 150 hours, at the very least, into the translation and[CR]editing.[CR] Around this time, Dark Force (from DeJap) was kind enough to take[CR]Neill[CR] Corletts place as the main ASM hacker. He worked 8+ hours per day on[CR]it,[CR] for probably a little over 2 and a half months. We all put in a lot[CR]of[CR] work to get the project to where it is today. And now you are[CR]reading[CR] this.[CR] V. Character Personalities, Etc.[CR]--------------------------------[CR] This section is a little long and[CR]probably boring. But if youre wondering[CR] why some of the text sounds bland[CR]or stiff, that was done on purpose. Both[CR] Sendak and Taicho talk kind of[CR]weird, please refer to them in this list.[CR] This isnt even a complete list[CR]of the characters in the game. Keeping[CR] track of everybody was hard.[CR]Especially after that long break halfway[CR] through editing.[CR] * Byuu -[CR]Heres Byuu, the main character. I dont think he has any[CR] dialogue of his[CR]own, save perhaps for choices youre allowed to[CR] make when responding to[CR]people. I didnt really do much with that[CR] text though, other than making it[CR]sound normal. I had to get each[CR] text choice on its own single line, so[CR]there were 1 or 2 times[CR] where I had to struggle to keep the text sounding[CR]the same as the[CR] original. Just one of those technical issues game[CR]translators[CR] have to live with.[CR] [CR] * Yoyo - Heres Yoyo, the princess[CR]of Kahna, and the so-called "Dragnar".[CR] I actually have a lot to say about[CR]the title "Dragnar", but Ill[CR] talk about that later. Anyway, one of the[CR]weak points of this[CR] games story is definitely in Yoyos character, at least[CR]in my[CR] opinion. Shes just plain stupid, and although thats not a[CR]problem in the plot, her dialogue and stuff was so stupidly[CR] written I[CR]wanna barf. Shes like this mega idiot blonde girl, she[CR] gets kidnapped and[CR]is scared of her powers. I dunno, youll just[CR] have to see for yourself how[CR]uncreative the writers were.[CR] Anyway, I didnt have to try too hard to bring[CR]across her[CR] ditziness. She does talk like a girl though, so I tried to[CR]bring[CR] that forth - but if you ask specifically how that is done, I[CR]cant[CR] answer very well. Not all girls talk similarly in English so I[CR]tried the best I could.[CR] * Palpaleos - Palpaleos is a general of the[CR]Empire, and Emperor Sauzers[CR] best friend. He plays a big part in the plot,[CR]but his[CR] dialogue isnt all that spectacular, and the way he talks[CR] isnt[CR]all that out of the ordinary, so I basically just tried[CR] to make his text[CR]sound natural. Of course, everybody talks[CR] different depending on who[CR]theyre talking to, who else is[CR] with them, etc., so when I say I tried to[CR]make it sound[CR] natural, I mean depending on each situation.[CR] * Sendak -[CR]Sendaks an old man (yes, hes a man for those who have doubts).[CR] Hes kind of[CR]like an old advisor for the king and Yoyo. Being[CR] an old man, he speaks in[CR]a definite old-man manner in the[CR] original Japanese. Its hard to bring that[CR]across in English[CR] without using voices, so I tried to first draw out his[CR]sentences[CR] as much as possible, since old people do tend to ramble on a[CR]lot. Luckily, this fits in with another quirk in his[CR] personality - that he[CR]rambles and complains a lot. He also[CR] talks/thinks to himself a lot. To[CR]help accentuate his[CR] rambliness I decided to not let him use many[CR]contractions in his[CR] speech. Whether or not this was a good idea I dont[CR]know, but I[CR] tried to be consistent at least. I did let him use[CR]contractions[CR] when he was talking to himself though. He seemed very[CR]self[CR] concious and it just seemed fine to have him talk like that.[CR] And[CR]yeah, I dont know whats up with him, he does seem a little[CR] too attached to[CR]Byuu. Ill leave any inferences to the player.[CR] Especially the... one[CR]scene.[CR] * Matelite - Matelite is the head of the knights of Kahna from what[CR]I can[CR] tell. Hes a big loudmouth and rude. These kinds of[CR] personalities[CR]are always fun to try to translate, because its[CR] at least possible in[CR]English translations. In contrast to[CR] Sendak and Taicho, I let Matelite use[CR]lots of contractions and[CR] quicker-sounding speech. Im sure most people wont[CR]notice it[CR] anyway, though. For the most part, the content of his[CR]dialogue[CR] makes up a big part of his personality, the way he says it is[CR]only the icing on the cake. I like to think I did a reasonble[CR] job with[CR]him, though Im sure some would want to disagree.[CR] * Bikkebakke -[CR]Bikkebakke, Rush, and Truce apparently were all just barely[CR] surviving[CR]before Byuu let them into Kahnas dragon squad.[CR] Because theyre so similar[CR]in character and always hanging[CR] around each other, I tried to keep the[CR]styles of all three[CR] pretty close together. And since theyre kind of young[CR]and[CR] not especially intelligent, I try to have them talk kind of[CR] quick,[CR]and with lots of contractions and things like[CR] "gonna".[CR] Bikkebakke[CR]himself looks up to Byuu, almost as kind of an[CR] older brother. He often[CR]refers to Byuu as "aniki" in the[CR] Japanese version, but that shows[CR]familiarity more than[CR] anything else, in this case (IMHO). Because of this[CR]word,[CR] some people who dont know a whole lot of Japanese think[CR]Bikkebakke is Byuus little brother, but this is not true.[CR] Watch out for[CR]people who pretend to know Japanese.[CR] * Rush - Rush hangs around Bikkebakke[CR]and Truce a lot. Hes really[CR] headstrong, and doesnt like to think too much.[CR]Hence the name, I[CR] suppose. Anyway, he reminds me of a hyperactive kid in[CR]his late[CR] teens, so I tried to make him come across as such. Hope it[CR]worked.[CR] * Truce - Truce. It took a lot of time to pin down a good[CR]transliteration[CR] of his katakana name, but I think this is most likely what[CR]it[CR] should be. Ive seen people call him Tulus or Toulouse or Taurus,[CR]but I dont think any of them are quite right.[CR] Truce seems to be the less[CR]hyper of the three, to me at least. I[CR] hope this comes across. Im worried a[CR]lot about inconsistencies[CR] in his language that might creep in. In old, old[CR]versions of the[CR] script he talked a little too stiff. If this is still[CR]anywhere[CR] in the script, itd be in the first few chapters. Hopefully I[CR]eliminated these inconsistencies.[CR] * Taicho - Taicho is/was the captain of[CR]the army of Mahal. Unfortunately[CR] the Empire kicked the crap out of them[CR]and now Taicho is out of[CR] a job, home, and wife.[CR] Taichos dialog style[CR]was difficult to decide on. In the end, I[CR] decided that since hes a[CR]captain, and since he ends everything[CR] with "de arimasu", that I should[CR]make him sound like a[CR] stiff-talking army guy. So his text will sound[CR]really stiff.[CR] Im betting that people who dont realize this purposely-[CR]made[CR] decision of mine will chalk up his stiff-sounding text to a bad[CR]translation/translator and/or bad editing, but they dont know[CR] the[CR]truth.[CR] At any rate, Im concerned the most about Taichos dialog,[CR]because there were some major inconsistencies in his text in[CR] early[CR]chapters in early versions of the script. If he suddenly[CR] starts talking[CR]normal, let me know, because hes not supposed to[CR] sound normal.[CR] One of[CR]the main things that is lost in translation if his text[CR] is his "de[CR]arimasu". Its kind of like his signature "word", but[CR] in translation that[CR]word is lost. Normally that might not be so[CR] important, but there are a few[CR]times when people are making fun[CR] of him, or when hes talking and the game[CR]doesnt tell you hes[CR] talking, you can just tell its him from the "de[CR]arimasu". But[CR] in translation thats gone, so it makes things harder.[CR]Ive[CR] tried my best to keep things working, but this is just one of[CR] the[CR]problems any translator will have to face. I could always[CR] go the Pokemon[CR]route and have him say "Taicho Taicho!!" at the[CR] end of every sentence, but[CR]then I would have a mob and the[CR] flaming torches and the biting and the[CR]kicking... And the[CR] Mini-Devils already talk like that.[CR] * Gunso - Gunso[CR]is a heavy-armor knight under Taicho. He apparently has[CR] some weird[CR]scratching problem - Ill leave any possible reasons[CR] up to the player. I[CR]tried to keep his dialogue between normal[CR] and Taicho-level stiffness. It[CR]varies but not by a whole lot.[CR] * Barclay - Barclay is another heavy-armor[CR]knight under Taichos command.[CR] His text is a little less stiff than Taicho,[CR]because of little[CR] side-story stuff that happens later in the game.[CR] *[CR]Anastasia - Didnt do a whole lot with her character, as she has VERY few[CR]lines in the game. I just made her sound normal.[CR] * Diana - Same as[CR]Anastasia, I didnt do a whole lot with Dianas text.[CR] * Ectarina - Ectarina[CR]seems like a shy girl, and very unstable. So I tried[CR] to bring that[CR]forth.[CR] * Frederica - She seems to be way too hooked on medicine. I tried[CR]to at[CR] least make her sound like it, although in reality I didnt[CR] have[CR]to do much.[CR] * Joy - Um, theres not a whole lot to say about her. She[CR]serves the queen[CR] of Campbell, so when she DOES talk I try to make her[CR]sound elegant[CR] and/or official, but she doesnt talk a whole lot.[CR] *[CR]Melodia - Melodia is a little girl. Its pretty easy to make people[CR] sound[CR]like little kids, because we have little-kid talk in[CR] English too.She hangs[CR]around the Mini-Devils a lot, and in a[CR] way she even looks kind of like[CR]them (not so much in battle[CR] though). I think I did okay with her text,[CR]though there might[CR] be a few places where I could have made her sound more[CR]kid-like[CR] than I did.[CR] * Nelbo - Just like Joy, Nelbo serves the queen[CR]of Campbell, and as such I[CR] tried to make her fit that character in her[CR]dialogue. Of which[CR] there is VERY little of.[CR] Anyway, Nelbo = :) IMO[CR]* Zora - Zoras an older woman, and I guess she serves Princess Yoyo. She[CR]isnt all that graceful or anything, and shes pretty rough. She[CR] yells at[CR]people a lot, not to mention occasional physical[CR] violence. I tried to[CR]bring this coarseness out. Shes a mother of[CR] one of the other characters,[CR]so I tried to make her sound like a[CR] strict, middle-aged mother.[CR] *[CR]Lukia - Lukia is a light armor knight. Shes kind of playful in a[CR] kissy-[CR]kissy sort of way. I think you know what I mean. Anyway she[CR] also seems[CR]like a big loudmouth to me so I tried to put that into[CR] her dialogue.[CR] *[CR]Jeanne - I dont know a whole lot about Jeanne, but people mention shes[CR]sort of tomboyish in the game, so I tried to make her sound like[CR] that.[CR]* Mist - Shes constantly bragging about her good looks and talking to[CR]herself about how beautiful she is. I didnt do too much with[CR] her. Shes[CR]also a secret character, for those who are paying[CR] attention.[CR] * Reeve -[CR]Reeve is a Lancer. Together with his friend Frenze, he does a[CR] lot of[CR]showing off of his lancing skills. I had a hard time[CR] figuring out what to[CR]name him and Frenze, but these seemed the[CR] best.[CR] * Frenze - Frenzes[CR]name was hard to figure out too. In the end Im glad I[CR] chose this one, its[CR]short and isnt too funky. Character-wise,[CR] hes just like Reeve, so theres[CR]not much to say.[CR] * Donfan - Donfan was my favorite character to work on.[CR]Translating his[CR] text was hell, but making it sound good was real fun. Im[CR]sure[CR] most people will agree a lot of his scenes throw in a lot of[CR]much-needed humor to break up the over-dramatic monotony of the[CR] story.[CR]Maybe itll make some people laugh out loud even. Id[CR] be real happy if it[CR]did.[CR] Anyway, the first thing I should point out that his name in[CR]Japanese can be seen as a rendition of "Don Juan". He certainly[CR] fits the[CR]character, sort of. The reason I chose Donfan was[CR] two-fold: that was what[CR]I called him from the start, and[CR] changing his name later on would suck,[CR]and the name "Don Juan"[CR] doesnt fit too well in this game, in English, IMO.[CR]Of course,[CR] calling him Donfan isnt exactly wrong either, its a[CR]perfectly[CR] allowable rendition of his katakana name. In the end its[CR]just[CR] a choice the translator will have to make, and I chose Donfan.[CR] I[CR]think most people will like this one better. And if not, they[CR] should stick[CR]bananas in their ears.[CR] I tried to make his speech really wild and corny. I[CR]hope people[CR] appreciate his text style. My only concerns are that maybe[CR]early in the game his style will be slightly inconsistent with[CR] his style[CR]later in the game. Ill hopefully have had that fixed[CR] up by the final[CR]patch.[CR] Also theres his trademark line, its a bugger to translate.[CR] Ah[CR]well. Im pretty sure my translation of "such is the way of[CR] the world" is[CR]WRONG. Im fairly certain "thats what Im here[CR] for" or "thats my job" is[CR]closer. But I think Ill keep it as[CR] is until I can take a break and look at[CR]it again with clearer[CR] eyes. If that makes sense at all.[CR] * Zoras Son -[CR]Zoras Son doesnt give his name (right away), probably[CR] because having Zora[CR]for his mother really screwed him up in[CR] the head. Character-wise, he seems[CR]like a kind of innocent[CR] guy who had the unfortunate luck of having a real[CR]monster of[CR] a woman for a mother. So hes kind of timid, and I tried to[CR]put that into his text.[CR] * Manyo - Manyo is one of the Mini-Devils. Theres[CR]not a whole lot to say[CR] except these guys are weird. I think theyre really[CR]into death[CR] and praying to gods of death and stuff. Actually you dont[CR]know[CR] about that until maybe midway of the game. When I got to that[CR]text I was like, "WTF." Anyway, my only decision was how to make[CR] the text[CR]in parentheses sound - should I make it sound weird,[CR] like caveman talk, or[CR]just normal, like normal subtitles? In the[CR] end I chose to do a little of[CR]both.[CR] * Monyo - See above. Nothing special here.[CR] * Munyo - See above[CR]again. Bleh.[CR] * Wagahai - Wagahais a Mini-Devil who thinks he/she is better[CR]than the[CR] others. Im not quite sure about a couple lines this[CR] Mini-[CR]Devil says inside the ship (youll see what I mean, I need[CR] to analyze those[CR]lines more), but this Mini-Devil is definitely[CR] proud. So the other Mini-[CR]Devils eventually get fed up with it,[CR] and then.... youll just have to play[CR];)[CR] * Sajin - Sajin is a ninja-for-hire. He doesnt say a whole lot, so[CR]I[CR] didnt put a whole lot of effort into making him his own style.[CR] *[CR]Zeroshin - Zeroshin is another ninja-for-hire. Hes extremely shy, and[CR]always writing letters back to his mother. I didnt need to[CR] do much with[CR]his text, the content of his text speaks for[CR] itself most of the time.[CR]VI. Naming[CR] ----------[CR] People like to think that translating non-[CR]dialogue stuff is real easy.[CR] Like translating item names, monster names,[CR]etc. Theyre actually MUCH[CR] harder than dialogue. It just seems easier to[CR]beginners because theyre[CR] single words. But a lot of items, spells,[CR]monsters, and the like are[CR] made-up names, or names based slighly off a[CR]real word, but arent real[CR] words themselves. Or, names which are originally[CR]neither Japanese nor[CR] English. BL had a lot of these words. There was a bit[CR]of German influence[CR] on this game. A lot of items and enemies were based[CR]off of World War I and[CR] II terminology. Others were of historical and[CR]religious significance,[CR] which I also had to research.[CR] A lot of work[CR]went into figuring out these item names. But there were a[CR] few lost causes.[CR]In these cases, I tried to come up with a good equivalent[CR] that would make[CR]sense to English speakers. So if anybody wants to complain[CR] about how I[CR]named things, you cant say I didnt put a lot of work into it.[CR] But I make[CR]mistakes too, so if I did make any, please let me know.[CR] Somebody once came[CR]up to me and said that all the character names in BL[CR] were supposed to[CR]represent who they are. For example, Rush. His name[CR] sort of signifies who[CR]he is. Also, theres Taicho, which literally is a[CR] sort of military[CR]commander, and Gunso, which is literally a sergeant.[CR] So this person also[CR]pointed out that the main character should be called[CR] "View" not "Byuu",[CR]since he gets to "view" all that happens in the game.[CR] I dont buy this.[CR]What about Sendak? Matelite? Palpaleos? Just doesnt[CR] work. But I thought Id[CR]throw this in for people to ponder over.[CR] Some of the chapter titles are[CR]kind of corny/weird, but Im not going to[CR] change them just because they[CR]sound weird. The one I have the most problem[CR] with is "Full of Regret". I[CR]should probably have translated it some other[CR] way, because "regret" doesnt[CR]seem to be the right word in this context.[CR] The title comes from a line[CR]Matelite says in the chapter, but again, regret[CR] doesnt seem to be quite[CR]the right word. But it still makes sense overall.[CR] Many of the default[CR]dragon names are slightly different. Byuus dragon is[CR] Salamander in the[CR]original, but that doesnt fit in 8 characters, so we[CR] dropped it down to[CR]Salmando. Icedrake was originally Icedragon. Thundera[CR] or whatever we[CR]called it was originally Thunder Hawk. What we have as[CR] Molten would[CR]probably sound best as Morten, IMO, but that was one of the[CR] things I[CR]conceded to DF. His reason for calling it Molten was because it[CR] would be[CR]the fourth element earth since the other 3 fire/thunder/water were[CR] used on[CR]the other dragons. The flagships name was originally Fahrenheit,[CR] but we[CR]had to make it fit within 8 characters, so now its Farnheit. You[CR] can[CR]always change these names to whatever you like; you get to name your[CR]dragons and your ship near the beginning of the game.[CR] In regard to[CR]"Dragnar", let me say this. From the katakana, Dragnar is the[CR] most likely[CR]English spelling. I used it in all my early scripts. I didnt[CR] like it very[CR]much, so I changed it to "Dragoner" in an edited script,[CR] mainly because[CR]other groups were calling it different things, and because[CR] people on[CR]message boards were calling it by that too. But after a while,[CR] I changed[CR]my mind again, and put it back to Dragnar. Id rather choose a[CR] name because[CR]of what the game says and what I think than because of outside[CR] influences.[CR]So now its "Dragnar" again. Plus, it has that sort of exotic[CR] feel that the[CR]original Japanese word has. Dragoner just doesnt sound all[CR] that[CR]exotic.[CR] Some item names were practically impossible to translate. The[CR]biggest[CR] culprit is "Drawer Thing", which is the closest rendition I think[CR]anybody[CR] can really make. Its a "thing" in a "you-know-what" type of sense,[CR]at[CR] least thats the originals meaning. "an item from a drawer - you[CR]know[CR] what it is." Another is Uniuji - I dont think this is "Sea Urchin[CR]Grub"[CR] but just another made up name. "Uni" shows up a lot in this game, so[CR]I[CR] think Uniuji is just another extension of that.[CR] VII. Editing[CR]------------[CR] I did all of the dialogue editing myself. So if it sucks,[CR]blame me. Dark[CR] Force helped to do some of the in-battle text, map[CR]dialogue, and other[CR] little things. I didnt always agree 100% with his[CR]decisions, but Im still[CR] very happy with how things turned out.[CR] Editing[CR]took me probably 2 months total. I wrote a custom text previewer[CR]application (which was pretty sucky), and went through every single line[CR]of text to make sure the text was formatted correctly. If it wasnt[CR]formatted correctly, the game would crash and it wouldnt work. Theres a[CR]slight chance there may be a line or two in the game that will overflow[CR]the box and freeze up the game, but if there are any of those lines, I[CR]must[CR] have missed them in my testing.[CR] Since the game is so linear, I[CR]went through each chapter and edited the[CR] text as I played. I would edit a[CR]chapters text, insert it into the game,[CR] try it out, then re-edit and[CR]reformat to sound better. I would then test[CR] this newer text and re-edit it[CR]again. I did this time after time after time,[CR] for each and every chapter.[CR]I played the game so much it was disgusting.[CR] VIII. Miscellaneous[CR]-------------------[CR] To answer one of the most-likely questions: Yes, the[CR]game is that perverted[CR] in the original version. I made sure not to go[CR]overboard, but I made sure[CR] not to be too cautious.[CR] Speaking of[CR]cautious, one of the big changes I was *going* to make was with[CR] the word[CR]"drug" that appears all throughout the game. In English, the first[CR] thing[CR]that word brings out is "illegal narcotic", which is not exactly how[CR] it is[CR]in Japanese. Because of this cultural difference, I was going to[CR] change[CR]all the instances of "drug" to different things like "Tonic", "Heal",[CR] etc.[CR]so that they would make sense in context. I can just see the little,[CR]immature teenagers making bad jokes and giggling about items like[CR] "High[CR]Drug" or "White Drug" or "Drug Hit" or "Heal Grass" or whatever else[CR] there[CR]is. In the end, though, I just decided, screw that, Im not gonna[CR] change[CR]it, people would just call the translation sucky if I changed it,[CR] and itd[CR]just take more time which I can spend sleeping.[CR] Originally the font was[CR]the same one as in Neills SD3 translation, but[CR] since this game looks so[CR]much like FF6, I wanted to go with FF3uss font.[CR] I had to slightly modify a[CR]few of the larger characters, like w and m,[CR] but in the end it looks real[CR]slick. Very professional looking.[CR] For those people who like to play games[CR]a zillion times and find all the[CR] smallest secrets, check out the checklist[CR]at my BL page. It lists[CR] some hard-to-find stuff, some of which is stuff we[CR]added and/or slightly[CR] changed (changed is such a harsh word).[CR] As for[CR]"Holy Dragons", this was a difficult decision. Certainly, these[CR] dragons[CR]are not of a holy nature. Dragon Gods was another possibility, but[CR] it just[CR]didnt seem quite right to me. Divine Dragons was another choice,[CR] but that[CR]sounds pretty funky, to me at least. It was a hard decision but I[CR] chose[CR]Holy Dragons in the end, because I had to choose *something*.[CR] IX. End[CR]-------[CR] Thats all for my little BL translation notes file. Im sure Ill[CR]think of[CR] stuff to add to it later, so if youre one of the weird geeks who[CR]has read[CR] this far, and you happen to be interested in this kind of stuff,[CR]check out[CR] my BL page at http://starmen.net/tomato/bahamut. If I ever want[CR]to update[CR] the translation notes, Ill do it there. I also have a[CR]complete[CR] walkthrough with screenshots, helpful tips, and explanations on[CR]how to get[CR] secret stuff at that site, not to mention lots of pics,[CR]downloads, and[CR] other stuff. So check it out sometime.[CR] X. Personal[CR]Thanks[CR] ------------------[CR] Too many people to thank. Neill Corlett[CR](http://lfx.org/~corlett), Dark[CR] Force, all my Japanese sensei and friends[CR]in Japan who helped me out with[CR] learning the language. reidman, and all[CR]the cool people at Starmen.Net. All[CR] the cool people over at MOs[CR]translation board, koitsu for pulling off that[CR] awesome April Fools joke[CR](you had me tricked for about 0.5 seconds, it was[CR] the lawyer name that[CR]gave it away big time), the people at the BL GameFaqs[CR] board who helped me[CR]with some info when I needed it, the authors of some[CR] Japanese BL pages[CR]which dont exist any longer, Summon Illusion, Zalagren,[CR] iMoose, and Square[CR](for the cool game, and for hopefully hiring me. Right???[CR] Come on. ;)[CR]NO thanks to all the "gimme BL now", "WHAT UP WITH BAHUMAT" kiddies who[CR]have pestered me for an entire year. "If youre translating BL why arent[CR]you letting people download it? youre a stupid liar" My answer to that is:[CR]I wasnt letting people download it because it wasnt done yet. Idiots.[CR] Now[CR]go play the game and stop reading my boring crap.[CR] -Tomato[CR](http://starmen.net/tomato)[CR] May 31,[CR]2002[CR]=============================================================================[CR]=============================================================================[CR]Bahamut[CR]Lagoon - Technical Notes by Dark[CR]Force[CR]----------------------------------------------[CR] Reprogramming[CR]-------------[CR] Originally, I only wanted to help out Neill finish his work[CR]on BL, I did[CR] not plan on taking over the entire project. It quickly became[CR]clear that[CR] Neill had no interest in finishing BL on his own or even with[CR]help, and so[CR] my interest in BL diminished as well. It was only when Tomato[CR]consistently[CR] began to persuade me to work on it and when the other groups[CR]began[CR] announcing their BL projects, that I decided to actually help.[CR]Initially, I was impressed by the work Neill had done with the 13x13 and[CR]8x8 variable width fonts and the dialogue script, thinking those would[CR]make[CR] my job really easy. Neill had done 3 of the 12x12 variable width[CR]fonts and[CR] one of the 8x8 variable width fonts, as well as the dialogue[CR]replacement[CR] and recompression. I never would have imagined how much was[CR]left to be done.[CR] Neill didnt know it at the time and neither did I, but he[CR]had only[CR] scratched the surface. And to make things worse, Tomato wanted[CR]EVERYTHING[CR] in a variable width font! So, reluctantly, I complied. It was a[CR]challenge[CR] to find enough VRAM space to hold all of the vwf text, like[CR]hacking the[CR] inventory screen, for example.[CR] Seeing the finished[CR]product, however, I think it was worth it. The game[CR] feels more like a psx[CR]game than an snes game, as I dont remember any other[CR] snes game or[CR]translation having a dynamic variable width 8x8 font (except[CR] for Front[CR]Mission which used one, I dont know if it used it everywhere or[CR] not). It[CR]was so nice not having to abbreviate item names and not truncating[CR] text,[CR]forcing it to sound bad. It makes the whole translation that much[CR] more[CR]friendly and enjoyable.[CR] Eventually I think this will affect future[CR]translations to do full 8x8 vwf[CR] hacks (which are much harder than 16x16[CR]vwf hacks). I know Bongo is already[CR] implementing one for his current[CR]project and Im thinking of doing one for[CR] Star Ocean. Kammedos BL patch[CR]also uses a variable width 8x8 font, but[CR] that was only after Neill tried[CR]adding one first.[CR] This game is by far one of the ugliest Ive worked on,[CR]especially when[CR] adding an 8x8 vwf. There are so many inconsistencies,[CR]hundreds of hardcoded[CR] pointers, dialogue scripts embedded in 2 separate[CR]scripting languages,[CR] individual text strings spread out all over the damn[CR]rom, every different[CR] kind of pointer system possible, at least 5 different[CR]fonts and routines to[CR] display them, which all look the same on screen![CR]Some of the fonts were[CR] identical when decompressed, yet were compressed[CR]with different routines. I[CR] often became quite sick of all the[CR]inconsistencies and stupidities in this[CR] game and can only imagine it was[CR]written by 5 separate teams who never[CR] spoke to each other and kept adding[CR]more features as hacks rather than[CR] including them into the game[CR]engine.[CR] After its all said and done, I can take pride in the work we did[CR]on this[CR] game. As far as the hacking goes I think its the best looking job[CR]Ive[CR] done to date, and Neill gets half the credit for that. Also, Tomatos[CR]12x12[CR] font makes the dialogue very easy to read. Its similar to my ToP[CR]font but[CR] his looks much better.[CR] Visualization[CR] -------------[CR] As[CR]with with other translations, I spent a lot of effort on redesigning the[CR]various screens and repositioning text and cursors to make the most[CR]effective use of space while still keeping the screens pretty and easy to[CR]read. The tech names were a bit too long in some places which cause some[CR]cramming, and one screen where there is a problem with space is the[CR]formation sub-screen, but overall they look great. I could have made more[CR]room by expanding the window borders right to the edges of the screen, but[CR]then the screen would appear cut off if the game was played on a TV screen[CR]instead of an emulator, and I intend to play it on my TV.[CR] I took some[CR]liberties along the way, improving some screens where I thought[CR] the[CR]original game needed improvement. Below is a list of modifications that[CR]changed the game from its original design:[CR] - Added variable width fonts[CR]everywhere[CR] * This will cause noticible slow down on some screens (such as[CR]item lists)[CR] compared to the Japanese version and you can even see it[CR]redrawing in[CR] some situations. For this reason, there is a separate patch[CR]for[CR] emulators which will reduce all the slowness. The emulator patch,[CR]however, will not work properly on a copier.[CR] - Inventory Menu Screen[CR] *[CR]I moved the 2 item columns as close together as I could to fit the[CR] longest[CR]item name. The right column is actually a bit wider than the[CR] left column,[CR]but its almost impossible to notice unless you have the[CR] same item name on[CR]both columns, which is also impossible.[CR] * The original text at the bottom[CR]read "Dragon Keepers Item Explanation",[CR] which sounded bad and was too long[CR]to fit with the vwf so I changed it[CR] to "Inventory / Item Details" because[CR]that sounds closer to what you can view[CR] and there are two separate screens[CR]accessible from that one menu option.[CR] * I made the regular item icons[CR]variable width, meaning you may notice[CR] that first letter of light armor[CR]items and heavy armor items do not[CR] line up.[CR] * For the item details I[CR]used up and down arrows to show status changes.[CR] - Dragons Menu Screen[CR]* I changed the dragon status attributes (at the botton of the screen)[CR]from font text to colorized icons drawn by CPF, which I think work much[CR]better especially given the limited room on that screen.[CR] - Formation Sub-[CR]Menu Screen[CR] * I moved around some text to make more room for tech lists,[CR]so a couple[CR] long item names (weapons/armor) overflow on to the next line.[CR]I dont[CR] care enough to fix it and its only on a small number of items[CR]so[CR] chances are you wont notice it, plus theres no more room to move it[CR]around anyways.[CR] - All Menu Status Screens[CR] * I chose not to use the[CR]variable width font for HP/MP/SP/LV/NEXT/EXP[CR] because I felt they were more[CR]important and I wanted them to stick out.[CR] * I also chose not to use the[CR]vwf for PARTY and PAGE for the same reason.[CR] * I chose to leave TIME as[CR]fixed width because its always directly followed[CR] by numbers which are also[CR]fixed width. It would look strange to mix the[CR] two font types together[CR]here.[CR] - Item Descriptions on Menu Screens[CR] * There is no shadow on the[CR]12x12 variable width font used for descriptions.[CR] Neill did this one and he[CR]didnt included a shadow, reason being its[CR] really nasty since the font is[CR]displayed using sprites. I dont blame[CR] him and it doesnt bother me enough[CR]to try and add a shadow to it.[CR] - All Money Screens[CR] * I chose to use PR[CR]instead of Piro (the games currency) because its[CR] more in line with using[CR]GP like Square does in its English translations.[CR] - Naming Screen[CR] * I[CR]completely redesigned this, instead of trying to reuse the Japanese[CR]layout. The result is it looks like a naming screen should be, instead[CR] of[CR]a hacked up Japanese one. The name cursor is also repositioned on a[CR] pixel[CR]basis, to accomodate the variable width font for the name.[CR] - Load/Save[CR]Game Screen[CR] * I expanded the 12x12 chapter names to print on two lines[CR]instead of one,[CR] because I didnt want to truncate any of Tomatos[CR]translations. Theres[CR] one small bug as a result but I dont care since this[CR]screen looks[CR] amazing the way it is now.[CR] - Title Screen[CR] * I fixed[CR]the "Temporally Play" graphic to read "Temporary Play",[CR] silly[CR]Square...[CR] * I Added our custom logos beside the Square logo.[CR] - Sound[CR]Menu Screen[CR] * Neill added a hidden jukebox (sound test) to the game. The[CR]names used[CR] in the track titles of the songs dont correspond to the[CR]spelling[CR] Tomato used in the dialogue, this is because the track titles[CR]were taken[CR] from an OST cd (I think) but werent necessarily correct, but we[CR]will[CR] still honor them. For example, they had Zauzer instead of Sauzer.[CR]- Dragon Feeding Screen[CR] * I changed how the dragon class was displayed[CR]slightly, by adding a cell[CR] separator instead of appending it with a[CR]slash.[CR] * I made the Loyalty/Fidelity statuses always visible, which the[CR]game[CR] originally hid unless you had an Uni Uni dragon; I think theyre[CR]useful[CR] to see at all times.[CR] * I also changed the graphics/text for[CR]Loyalty/Fidelity from ? and ??[CR] to letters of the status they actually[CR]represent.[CR] - Dragon Transformation[CR] * When the dragon transforms, I[CR]went as far as making it display a or[CR] an when it says "Transformed into[CR]a[n] xxx dragon.", instead of taking[CR] the cheap way out and saying "Became[CR]xxx dragon".[CR] - In-Battle Screens[CR] * I added pixel-centering for the[CR]magic/attack names and descriptions.[CR] * For the battle dialogue I forced it[CR]to be not centered (unlike the[CR] original game) because I felt centered[CR]dialogue didnt look right.[CR] * I also allowed the battle dialogue to have[CR]multiple lines of text,[CR] instead of just one line in the original.[CR] * I[CR]made the colorized item icons display instead of the standard vwf[CR] icons.[CR]This isnt really a change from the original, but Im listing it[CR] so that[CR]people dont think its a bug on our part: there is an icon that[CR] looks like[CR]a bomb in battle which is appears as a pot on the status[CR] screens. Thats[CR]what the original game did so Im keeping it the same[CR] way.[CR] * The[CR]character select window I shortened because it was longer than it[CR] needed[CR]to be now that we were using a variable width font for the names.[CR] * I[CR]removed the ":" after the element/status icons for enemies because it[CR]seemed completely useless to me.[CR] * For when a spell or item fails, I[CR]replaced the "Fail" word in Japanese[CR] with a "Fail!" graphic in English,[CR]but I dont know if thats the best[CR] word to use.. maybe "Miss!" or "Missed!"[CR]?[CR] - After-Battle Screens[CR] * I changed the colors of "Exp" and "Lv Up!".[CR]The game originally meant[CR] to display Exp in a different color, but because[CR]of a palette bug on[CR] their part, it showed up as white. When I fixed that[CR]and "Exp" showed[CR] up in yellow, "Lv Up!" looked strange also in yellow, so[CR]I changed it[CR] to the next available color which was orange.[CR] * I removed[CR]the "+" sign from the amount of exp gained after battle.[CR] - Main[CR]Dialogue[CR] * There are a few strings that contain hidden references to[CR]ourselves,[CR] one of them tells you how to access the jukebox.[CR] -[CR]Map/Field Dialogue[CR] * The scenario objective is now pixel-centered.[CR] *[CR]When drowning, it displays the message "Will drown in x turn[s].", I[CR] made[CR]the "s" in "turns" only display if there is more than 1 turn left,[CR] instead[CR]of taking the cheap way out and saying "turn(s)".[CR] * The only string we[CR]didnt find was "Dragon evolved into xxx", when a[CR] dragon evolves on the[CR]field. If anyone gets this to happen, please send[CR] us a savestate, you will[CR]probably see garbage text on the screen.[CR] - Map/Field Menus[CR] * For spell[CR]details, I drew range and radius icons instead of using text.[CR] * For the[CR]terrain window, I replaced the 12x12 font with an 8x8 variable[CR] width font[CR]and pixel-centered the terrain type (Tomatos idea).[CR] * For the main menus,[CR]I used different idents/cursor positions depending[CR] if the field menu or[CR]attack menu or dragon menu is being displayed,[CR] in an effort to make the[CR]text in the menu look centered. It works most[CR] of the time but not[CR]always.[CR] - Intro/End Credits[CR] * Fixed Squares spelling mistakes[CR]("designner") and added us to the[CR] credits.[CR] Editing[CR] -------[CR]Like Tomato said, I helped with the editing for map and battle dialogue,[CR]so[CR] dont complain to him if the text isnt exactly what was said in[CR]Japanese.[CR] I wanted to make the text sound more elaborate rather than using[CR]the lame[CR] incomplete phrases that existed in Japanese. For example, [CR]original text: "Lestat: I havent started yet!",[CR] my edit: "Lestat: I still[CR]have a full deck up my sleeve!" (talking about[CR] showing his potential in[CR]battle); or, [CR] original text: "Sauzer: The Holy Dragons power... It is a[CR]terrifying power!",[CR] my edit: "Sauzer: The power of the Holy Dragons[CR]commands such malevolence..."[CR] Thats not exactly what youd call literal[CR]translations. I know Tomato wanted[CR] to keep to the original scripts while[CR]still trying to make them sound good,[CR] but in this case I didnt think that[CR]would work, and I wanted to have some fun[CR] with those scripts as well. The[CR]only reason I chose to edit them was because[CR] I was sick of hacking at this[CR]point.[CR] Retranslations[CR] --------------[CR] Anyone who wants to translate[CR]BL to their own language, DO NOT CONTACT US AND[CR] DO NOT RIP OFF OUR PATCH![CR]We will plan on working on multilingual BL[CR] translations when were ready.[CR]In the mean time, Kammedo is probably more able[CR] to help with translating[CR]BL to other languages, I think hes already planning[CR] one for German. There[CR]is also a group that already has a BL patch in French[CR] that could also help[CR]you with another language translation. Theres also a[CR] Thai translation[CR]group that has made a decent BL patch.[CR] -Dark Force[CR](http://www.dejap.com)[CR] May 31, 2002[CR] Whats New[CR] ----------[CR]VERSION 1.3:[CR] * Fixed all the crashing that happened. This was because of a[CR]simple[CR] missing % sign in the main script. The game now runs fine. Weve re-[CR]tested[CR] the entire game and no crashes were to be found. If the game[CR]crashes,[CR] then you likely have a bad ROM.[CR] * Fixed a few aesthetical[CR]things in the script.[CR] * Fixed that fireworks graphical glitch for[CR]good.[CR] VERSION 1.2:[CR] * The checksum has been fixed. So if you apply this[CR]patch and your emulator[CR] says the checksum is bad, it means your original[CR]ROM was corrupt. Look[CR] elsewhere for the ROM. WE WILL NOT SEND ONE TO YOU[CR]OR TELL YOU WHERE TO[CR] GET ONE. If, after you apply the patch, the checksum[CR]is OK, then you have[CR] a good version of the ROM.[CR] * Fixed instances in[CR]the script that might have frozen the game if you[CR] renamed a main character[CR]to a long name. This will fix the problems that[CR] a few people had in[CR]Chapters 6, 12, and 15.[CR] * Also fixed some spelling and text consistency[CR]issues. Fixed a few item[CR] and dragon class names, as well.[CR] * Re-edited[CR]a bit of the map dialogue text and other map messages.[CR] * Fixed the dragon[CR]evolution line on the map scene. Thanks to all who[CR] provided us with save[CR]states.[CR] Known Issues[CR] ------------[CR] * Zsnes 1.337 WIN has a bug[CR]during battle where the message window appears[CR] in the middle of the screen[CR]after an attack fails. THIS IS NOT OUR[CR] PROBLEM! This will be remedied in[CR]future versions of ZSNES.[CR] [CR] * Load/save game screen: garbage text[CR]appears at bottom of screen momentarily[CR] when saving a game.[CR] * Long[CR]item names on formation sub-screen overflow onto the next line.[CR] * There is[CR]a version of the ROM out there that gets your party members to[CR] Level 99[CR]instantly. This is a bad ROM. THIS IS NOT OUR PROBLEM! There are[CR] also[CR]versions of the ROM that are corrupt and will cause the game to[CR] reset[CR]randomly or just mess up in weird ways.[CR] * If you use cheat codes, the game[CR]may suddenly reset on you at anytime.[CR] Use cheat codes at your own[CR]risk.[CR] ! If anyone notices any other bugs, please report them to us.[CR]Bug when using the patch on a COPIER ONLY[CR]-----------------------------------------[CR] When viewing the list of items[CR]in battle or during dragon feeding, the item[CR] names may show garbage text.[CR]To get around this problem, select any item in[CR] the list as if you were[CR]about to use it, then press the B button to cancel[CR] and return to the item[CR]list. When you return to the list, the item names[CR] will be properly[CR]displayed.[CR] Patching Help[CR] -------------[CR] For the first time, we are[CR]not providing any support for using this patch.[CR] We didnt spend all these[CR]months translating this game only to be barraged[CR] by questions on how to[CR]apply the patch. If you havent figured it out by[CR] now, the DeJap forum is[CR]the place to ask these questions. Click on the[CR] Forum icon at the top of[CR]the DeJap homepage (the link has been fixed), but[CR] for lazy people, the URL[CR]is http://board.zsnes.com/index.php?board=6 .[CR] Make sure to read the topics[CR]at the very top of the board; the answers you[CR] need will most likely be[CR]there already.[CR] Credits[CR] -------[CR] All Translations...........:[CR]Tomato[CR] All Programming/Hacking....: Neill, Dark Force[CR] 12x12 VWF[CR]Font.............: Tomato[CR] 8x8 VWF Font...............: Neill[CR] 16x16[CR]Status Icons.........: CPF[CR] 8x8 Naming Font............: CPF[CR] All Main[CR]Dialogue Editing..: Tomato[CR] Non Main Dialogue Editing..: Tomato, Dark[CR]Force[CR] Testing....................: Tomato, Dark Force, Neill[CR] Special[CR]Thanks to (for technical assistance):[CR] Neill, Bongo, Kammedo, F.H[CR]Special Thanks to (for other):[CR] iMoose, zalagren, Summon Illusion, MO, Shih[CR]Tzu, Major Damage, animesou,[CR] didalos, katharsis</plot>

    <plot>This game is a strange hybrid of Shining Force and Contra. That's the best way[CR]to describe it. It's a military strategy game in which your team of up to[CR]eight members has to complete a set of objectives in order to clear rounds.[CR]The game is fairly simple when it comes to gameplay, but you can customize[CR]your characters' name and weaponry. Sometimes, the difference between a long[CR]range rifle and a Luger can make or break a game. The game doesn't seem very[CR]complicated at the start, but as the missions get progressively harder, you[CR]have to plan out moves ahead of schedule, making sure that your enemies don't[CR]sneak up on you or remain hidden. [s]PROTIP[/s] A hint: Use the Search command[CR]to look ahead! That's a very valuable weapon, so use it often.[CR]Read[CR]Me:[CR]BB GUN: SURVIVAL GAME SIMULATION[CR]ENGLISH TRANSLATION[CR]V1.00[CR]Copyright 2004 Aeon[CR]Genesis[CR]http://agtp.romhack.net[CR]ToC[CR]1.About BB Gun[CR]2.Patch[CR]History[CR]3.Patch Credits and Contributors[CR]4.Known Issues[CR]5.Application[CR]Instructions[CR]6.Troubleshooting[CR]--------[CR]1.BB Gun[CR]--------[CR]BB[CR]Gun is a strategy game that simulates the Japanese survival game[CR]hobby --[CR]war games, basically, similar to strategic paintball with[CR]non-paint-based[CR]guns.

You can hit enemies no[CR]matter where they are, but[CR]if theyre not in your direct line of sight[CR]then they wont show up on the[CR]map. Its a pretty nifty game.[CR]---------------[CR]2.Patch[CR]History[CR]---------------[CR]This project, took two years. At the same time,[CR]it took two days. Weird,[CR]eh? Basically, I spent an evening dumping the[CR]scripts and shovelling them[CR]over to Tomato for translation (this was the[CR]last project he worked on[CR]before his computer blew up or whatever) and[CR]then, not being skilled[CR]enough to make the changes Id wanted to the[CR]dialogue and text display[CR]systems, the translated scripts sat idle for two[CR]years. Fast forward to[CR]the middle of August, this year, at which point I[CR]took another stab at[CR]it, figured it out, and got it all done in the space[CR]of two days. Whee![CR]Threw it through the usual gauntlet of tests, fixed a[CR]few issues,[CR]and heres the result.[CR]October 2, 2004 - Initial version 1.00[CR]Release[CR]---------------[CR]3.Patch Credits[CR]---------------[CR]THE BB GUN[CR]TEAM[CR]Main Team:[CR]Gideon Zhi - Project leader, Romhacker[CR]Tomato -[CR]Translation[CR]Special thanks to Shih Tzu for helping with a few names that[CR]puzzled me.[CR]--------------[CR]4.Known Issues[CR]--------------[CR]--The[CR]inexplicably compressed hi-res popup windows have a few typos in[CR] them[CR](that were in the Japanese version.)

    <plot>Banpresto League Soccer is basically what this is. You have your Ultraman[CR]team, and your Gundam team, and your Masked Rider team, and etc etc., and it's[CR]all very cartoony and SD and cutesy. I tried playing a game and it was really[CR]weird.

Headered ROMs[CR]are not supported.[CR]Either hardpatch the IPS to a ROM or have an emulator[CR]auto-apply the patch.[CR]For the latter, simply rename the IPS file to match[CR]your ROMs filename.[CR]Snes9X is smooth, but music can be grainy. [CR]ZSNES[CR]can be choppy, but music is perfect.[CR]BSNES seems decent overall, but wasnt[CR]extensively tested.[CR]Surprisingly, SNES emulators for PSP and XBOX run[CR]Brandish 2 nicely.[CR]Always enable VSync! Otherwise youll ecounter some[CR]intense tearing.[CR]=============== GAME HELP ===============[CR]Brandish can[CR]be pretty unforgiving. There is a guide on GameFAQs, which[CR]is incomplete[CR]but good enough for 75% of the game. Hopefully it will be[CR]finished someday,[CR]especially now that this English patch is available.[CR]- Press L+R to rest at[CR]all time. HP and MP will recover, but Ares is[CR] vulnerable to enemy attacks[CR]while resting.[CR]- Make sure you hunt down every possible item. Missing one[CR]of the [CR] "Dimensional Boxes" will seriously hamper your progress.[CR]Nothing[CR] is permanently missable though, youll just have to backtrack.[CR]-[CR]Stacking items frees up inventory space. You can only stack things[CR] like[CR]Potions, Rings, Keys and Gold. Just select one, then the other.[CR] Note that[CR]you cant "un-stack" items! Not that youd really want to.[CR]- You should[CR]experiment with the three control schemes available in the[CR] configuration[CR]screen (strafe / rotate / mouse).[CR]- Adjusting the game speed may help for a[CR]tough boss fight.[CR]- Hit select to access in-game inventory. [CR] Then press[CR]"Examine" (Y by default) to drop an item. [CR] Its actually R+"Examine" to[CR]examine an item... confused yet?[CR]- You can have your weapons repaired in[CR]specific shops.[CR] This only works when attempting to sell used swords.[CR]-[CR]You dont have to stick to a sword and shield combo. Try dual wielding![CR]-[CR]EMERGENCY LOAD PROCEDURE: If you somehow get stuck in a pit or cant[CR] get[CR]out of a sticky situation, you can hold R while loading your game.[CR] This[CR]will bring up a map where you can pick a destination to warp to.[CR] As well[CR]as forfeiting any unsaved progress, all stats will decrease by 1.[CR] You can[CR]always rebuild these stats, its just a temporary setback.[CR] *hint* Theres[CR]another use for this procedure.[CR]=============== OTHERS[CR]===============[CR]Our group strictly focuses on the Brandish series and to[CR]some extent,[CR]all Nihon Falcom games. We tried our best to remain faithful[CR]to the[CR]original Japanese text while integrating a few elements from[CR]the[CR]American release of Brandish 1 (SNES), such as various item[CR]names[CR]and common in-game messages.[CR]If you enjoyed playing through[CR]Brandish 2 and own a PSP, you should[CR]consider purchasing the Brandish 1[CR]remake for said system. Otherwise,[CR]you could also contact non-Japanese[CR]publishers and request them to[CR]evaluate releasing an English version of[CR]Brandish PSP. Between this patch,[CR]the recent remake and an upcoming[CR]Brandish 4 translation, its a great[CR]time to be a fan so lets make the most[CR]of it![CR]=============== HISTORY ===============[CR]Version 1.0, November 3[CR]2009[CR]- Initial release[CR]=============== ISSUES ===============[CR]- About[CR]4 strings were prefixed with "~~"; we just couldnt trigger[CR] them after[CR]three months of intense beta testing. Probably leftovers[CR] from the original[CR]PC98 version. If you run into one of them, congrats![CR] Send us a quick email[CR]and go buy a lottery ticket while youre at it.[CR]- There are exactly 4 minor[CR]graphical hiccups during Dela Delons second[CR] boat scene. Depending on your[CR]emulator, you might not even notice this.[CR]- The soundtrack does "lag" once[CR]in a while. This does not appear to be[CR] patch-related. Unfortunately, KOEI[CR]really dropped the ball there.[CR]- We fixed some bugs but left in some[CR]harmless ones as well, including:[CR] - Hitting the sea with a[CR]sledgehammer.[CR] - Examining switches from behind a wall.[CR] - Some[CR]"Examine" messages will only display in "Strafe" mode.[CR]Let us know if you[CR]find anything wrong:[CR]denpanosekai [AT] gmail [DOT] com (include "BRANDISH2"[CR]in the subject line)</plot>

    <plot>Breath of Fire 2's translation is infamously terrible. From "Yes" and "No"[CR]being swapped to the game asking you to equip a fishing lod and bait, the[CR]writing in the game is bad even by Capcom's low standards. The game itself is[CR]supposed to have a really interesting plot, but the text deteriorates to a[CR]point towards the end that nobody can really make any sense of what's going[CR]on. That said, it's not a bad game. The dragon spells are pretty useless,[CR]unfortunately, but the rest of it is fairly standard RPG fare. The music's[CR]decent, the graphics are good, and the game's fairly tough, but if the meat of[CR]an RPG is the story, this one's so stringy and tough that it drowns out just[CR]about everything else. Hopefully the current translation project will correct[CR]this.[CR]Read Me:[CR]Diese Datei ist inhaltlich identisch mit[CR]"Manual.pdf".[CR]Sie ist nur fA 1/4 r Leute gedacht, die Probleme mit dem[CR]Darstellen von Pdf-Dateien haben.[CR]Inhalt:[CR]1.

Vorwort[CR]Endlich ist es geschafft. Nach fast 2 Jahren[CR]harter Arbeit prA$?sentieren wie euch den deutschen Breath of Fire II[CR]Abersetzungspatch fA 1/4 r das SNES.[CR]Neben der reinen Abersetzung enthA$?lt[CR]dieser Patch auAerdem neue Features, grafische Verbesserungen und vieles[CR]mehr.[CR]ErwA$?hnenswert sind vor allen Dingen das komplett neue Intro mit[CR]einem gesungenen Song, eine Pseudo-3D-Weltkarte, transparente[CR]Textfenster,[CR]mit Hinblick auf die japanische Version berichtigte Charakternamen und[CR]erweiterte Itemnamen.[CR]Wir wA 1/4 nschen euch viel Freude mit diesem Patch[CR]und hoffen, dass er euch beim Spielen genauso viel Spass bereitet, wie[CR]wir[CR]mit der Abersetzung des Spiels hatten.[CR]-Team BOF2, September[CR]2006[CR]3. Verwendung[CR]Dieser Patch muss mit Hilfe eines Programms, wie z.B.[CR]dem beiliegenden Lunar IPS von Fusoya ( http://fusoya.panicus.org/ )[CR]auf[CR]ein einwandfreies "Breath of Fire II" Original-ROM angewendet[CR]werden.[CR]Achtung: Wer das ROM herunterlA$?dt und verwendet, ohne das[CR]Originalmodul des Spiels zu besitzen, macht sich strafbar![CR]Das benAPtigte[CR]ROM ist in der SNES-Spieledatenbank GoodSNES unter dem Namen "Breath of Fire[CR]II (U) [!].zip" verzeichnet.[CR]Die CRC32(PrA 1/4 fsumme) dieses ROMS lautet[CR]"C8B919AA". Der Patch funktioniert ausschlieAlich mit diesem[CR]ROM.[CR]Verwendung von Lunar IPS:[CR]-Lunar IPS.exe starten[CR]-Auf "Apply IPS[CR]Patch" klicken[CR]-Datei "Breath of Fire II German V1.0.ips"[CR]auswA$?hlen[CR]-Im nA$?chsten Dateiauswahlfenster das ROM "Breath of Fire II[CR](U) [!].smc" (CRC32: C8B919AA) auswA$?hlen.[CR]4. Features[CR]-PrA 1/4[CR]fsummenverifizierung[CR]Beim ersten Start des Roms erscheint zuerst der PrA[CR]1/4 fsummentestbildschirm. Hier prA 1/4 ft das Spiel, ob die ROM-Datei[CR]unbeschA$?digt ist und korrekt[CR]gepatcht wurde. Sollte dieser Test[CR]fehlschlagen, so habt ihr etwas beim Patchen des ROMs falsch gemacht, mit[CR]groAer Wahrscheinlichkeit liegt[CR]dies an der Verwendung eines falschen oder[CR]beschA$?digten Breath of Fire 2 ROMs. In diesem Fall wird das Spiel nicht[CR]starten und euch auffordern,[CR]es noch einmal korrekt zu patchen.[CR]FA$?llt[CR]der Test positiv aus, wird dies im batteriegestA 1/4 tzten Spielstandspeicher[CR]vermerkt und der Test wird bei jedem zukA 1/4 nftigen Laden des ROMs[CR]nicht[CR]mehr ausgefA 1/4 hrt.[CR]-Test des Videomodus[CR]Dieses Spiel ist fA[CR]1/4 r die Verwendung auf NTSC-Systemen mit 60Hz Bildwiederholfrequenz[CR]ausgelegt. Wird das Spiel im 50Hz Pal-Modus gestartet,[CR]erscheint zu Beginn[CR]des Spiels ein Warnhinweis, der das Spiel jedoch in keiner Weise beeinflusst,[CR]es ist also auch in 50Hz abgesehen von der leicht[CR]verlangsamten[CR]Spielgeschwindigkeit voll spielbar.[CR]-Neues Intro[CR]Im Intro werden die[CR]Charaktere vorgestellt.[CR]Nach dem Capcom-Logo gelangt man durch das DrA 1/4[CR]cken von Start zum Titelbildschirm, nochmaliges DrA 1/4 cken startet das[CR]Spiel.[CR]-SpielstA$?nde[CR]Durch die tiefgreifenden VerA$?nderungen, die am[CR]Spiel durchgefA 1/4 hrt wurden, ist es nicht mehr mAPglich, SpielstA$?nde aus[CR]vorherigen Versionen[CR]von Breath of Fire II zu verwenden. Dies gilt sowohl[CR]fA 1/4 r batteriegestA 1/4 tztes SRAM als auch fA 1/4 r Savestates (z.B. Zsnes[CR]*.zst Dateien).[CR]Alte SRAM-SpielstA$?nde werden gelAPscht, beim Laden von[CR]Savestates startet das Spiel neu und gibt eine Fehlermeldung aus.[CR]-Neue[CR]Textfenster[CR]Die Textausgabe wurde im Gegensatz zum Original stark[CR]verbessert. Das Textfenster wurde vergrAPssert, mit neuen Schriftarten,[CR]die[CR]variable Zeichenbreite(VWF) unterstA 1/4 tzen, ausgestattet und mit[CR]einem transparenten Farbverlauf versehen.[CR]Mit Hilfe eines zusA$?tzlichen[CR]Eintrags im OptionsmenA 1/4 des Spiels ist es auAerdem mAPglich, die[CR]Textfenster opak, das heisst[CR]undurchsichtig, zu machen. Diese Einstellung[CR]ist rein grafischer Natur und wirkt sich nicht auf den Spielverlauf[CR]aus.[CR]Hinweis: Aufgrund technischer Limitation des SNES werden Textboxen in[CR]bestimmten Situationen und Sequenzen automatisch[CR]opak geschaltet. Dies ist[CR]unabhA$?ngig von den gewA$?hlten Einstellungen und kann vom Anwender nicht[CR]beeinflusst werden.[CR]-Rennfunktion[CR]Es ist nun mAPglich, durch DrA 1/4[CR]cken von B zu rennen, ein Feature, dass man im Original schmerzlich[CR]vermisste.[CR]Hinweis: WA$?hrend einiger Sequenzen im Spiel ist es nicht[CR]mAPglich, zu rennen. Dies wurde auf 3 RA$?ume im gesamten[CR]Spiel[CR]beschrA$?nkt und ist notwendig, um einen fehlerfreien Spielverlauf zu[CR]garantieren.[CR]-Charakternamen und Abersetzung[CR]Das Dialogskript des Spiels[CR]wurde zuerst vom Englischen ins Deutsche A 1/4 bersetzt und anschliessend[CR]mit[CR]dem japanischen Original abgeglichen, wobei Zensuren und[CR]Abersetzungsfehler des englischen Skripts[CR]soweit wie mAPglich ausgebessert[CR]wurden. Danach wurde das Skript im Spiel getestet, wobei[CR]diverse unpassende[CR]Formulierungen abgeA$?ndert wurden.[CR]Die Namen aller Charaktere, StA$?dte,[CR]GegenstA$?nde und Gegner wurden anhand des japanischen Originals[CR]rekonstruiert[CR]und so gut wie mAPglich ins Deutsche A 1/4 bertragen.[CR]Englische und japanische Eigennamen wurden belassen,[CR]wenn es keine[CR]sinnvolle deutsche Abersetzung gab.[CR]Die LA$?nge der Namen aller Charaktere,[CR]Orte, Items, Gegner und ZaubersprA 1/4 che wurde erweitert um auf[CR]unschAPne[CR]AbkA 1/4 rzungen verzichten zu kAPnnen.[CR]-3D-Weltkarte[CR]Um[CR]die grafisch wenig aufregene Weltkarte ein wenig aufzuwerten, wurde ein[CR]Pseudo-3D-Effekt integriert.[CR]Aufgrund diverser technischer Limitationen des[CR]Spiels sowie des SNES fA$?llt dieser zwar eher subtil aus,[CR]trA$?gt aber[CR]dennoch zur Verbesserung der AtmosphA$?re bei.[CR]5. KompatiblitA$?t[CR]Bei[CR]der Entwicklung dieses Patches wurde in erster Linie darauf geachtet, das[CR]Spiel auf einem richtigen SNES[CR]so fehlerfrei wie mAPglich zu gestalten. Da[CR]wir es nicht als unsere Verantwortung sehen, Fehler und[CR]UnzulA$?nglichkeiten[CR]von Emulatoren zu berichtigen, wurde weitestgehend[CR]darauf verzichtet, derartige Fehler zu korrigieren oder zu umgehen.[CR]Die[CR]einzige Ausnahme bildet ein Fehler in der Soundemulation von ZSNES, der dafA[CR]1/4 r sorgt, dass das Originalspiel[CR]von Zeit zu Zeit nach KA$?mpfen abstA[CR]1/4 rzt. Hier wurde die Soundengine des Spiels geringfA 1/4 gig modifiziert,[CR]um derartige[CR]AbstA 1/4 rze zu vermeiden, da die Mehrzahl von euch[CR]vermutlich Zsnes verwenden wird, um den Patch zu spielen.[CR]Empfehlenswert[CR]sind folgende Systeme/Emulatoren:[CR]1. SNES (Originalhardware) - keine[CR]bekannten Probleme[CR]2. Bsnes (Emulator) - nahezu perfekte Emulation, aber[CR]rechenintensiv[CR]3. Zsnes (Emulator) - gute Emulation, leichte Probleme beim[CR]Abspielen der Intromusik, insbesondere im FastForward-Modus[CR]Nicht[CR]empfehlenswert:[CR]Snes9x (Emulator) - durch inakkurate Soundemulation schwere[CR]Probleme beim Abspielen der Intromusik.[CR]6.[CR]Mitwirkende[CR]Abersetzung:[CR]-Bredator[CR]-Reaper84[CR]-d4s[CR]ZusA$?tzliche[CR]Programmierung:[CR]-d4s[CR]ZusA$?tzliche Grafik:[CR]-d4s[CR]ZusA$?tzlicher[CR]Sound:[CR]-d4s[CR]Betatest:[CR]-Bredator[CR]-Reaper84[CR]-Flobo[CR]-Hydr0x</plot>

Sollte dieser Test[CR]fehlschlagen, so habt ihr etwas beim Patchen des ROMs falsch gemacht, mit[CR]groAer Wahrscheinlichkeit liegt[CR]dies an der Verwendung eines falschen oder[CR]beschA$?digten Breath of Fire 2 ROMs. In diesem Fall wird das Spiel nicht[CR]starten und euch auffordern,[CR]es noch einmal korrekt zu patchen.[CR]FA$?llt[CR]der Test positiv aus, wird dies im batteriegestA 1/4 tzten Spielstandspeicher[CR]vermerkt und der Test wird bei jedem zukA 1/4 nftigen Laden des ROMs[CR]nicht[CR]mehr ausgefA 1/4 hrt.[CR]-Test des Videomodus[CR]Dieses Spiel ist fA[CR]1/4 r die Verwendung auf NTSC-Systemen mit 60Hz Bildwiederholfrequenz[CR]ausgelegt. Wird das Spiel im 50Hz Pal-Modus gestartet,[CR]erscheint zu Beginn[CR]des Spiels ein Warnhinweis, der das Spiel jedoch in keiner Weise beeinflusst,[CR]es ist also auch in 50Hz abgesehen von der leicht[CR]verlangsamten[CR]Spielgeschwindigkeit voll spielbar.[CR]-Neues Intro[CR]Im Intro werden die[CR]Charaktere vorgestellt.[CR]Nach dem Capcom-Logo gelangt man durch das DrA 1/4[CR]cken von Start zum Titelbildschirm, nochmaliges DrA 1/4 cken startet das[CR]Spiel.[CR]-SpielstA$?nde[CR]Durch die tiefgreifenden VerA$?nderungen, die am[CR]Spiel durchgefA 1/4 hrt wurden, ist es nicht mehr mAPglich, SpielstA$?nde aus[CR]vorherigen Versionen[CR]von Breath of Fire II zu verwenden. Dies gilt sowohl[CR]fA 1/4 r batteriegestA 1/4 tztes SRAM als auch fA 1/4 r Savestates (z.B. Zsnes[CR]*.zst Dateien).[CR]Alte SRAM-SpielstA$?nde werden gelAPscht, beim Laden von[CR]Savestates startet das Spiel neu und gibt eine Fehlermeldung aus.[CR]-Neue[CR]Textfenster[CR]Die Textausgabe wurde im Gegensatz zum Original stark[CR]verbessert. Das Textfenster wurde vergrAPssert, mit neuen Schriftarten,[CR]die[CR]variable Zeichenbreite(VWF) unterstA 1/4 tzen, ausgestattet und mit[CR]einem transparenten Farbverlauf versehen.[CR]Mit Hilfe eines zusA$?tzlichen[CR]Eintrags im OptionsmenA 1/4 des Spiels ist es auAerdem mAPglich, die[CR]Textfenster opak, das heisst[CR]undurchsichtig, zu machen. Diese Einstellung[CR]ist rein grafischer Natur und wirkt sich nicht auf den Spielverlauf[CR]aus.[CR]Hinweis: Aufgrund technischer Limitation des SNES werden Textboxen in[CR]bestimmten Situationen und Sequenzen automatisch[CR]opak geschaltet. Dies ist[CR]unabhA$?ngig von den gewA$?hlten Einstellungen und kann vom Anwender nicht[CR]beeinflusst werden.[CR]-Rennfunktion[CR]Es ist nun mAPglich, durch DrA 1/4[CR]cken von B zu rennen, ein Feature, dass man im Original schmerzlich[CR]vermisste.[CR]Hinweis: WA$?hrend einiger Sequenzen im Spiel ist es nicht[CR]mAPglich, zu rennen. Dies wurde auf 3 RA$?ume im gesamten[CR]Spiel[CR]beschrA$?nkt und ist notwendig, um einen fehlerfreien Spielverlauf zu[CR]garantieren.[CR]-Charakternamen und Abersetzung[CR]Das Dialogskript des Spiels[CR]wurde zuerst vom Englischen ins Deutsche A 1/4 bersetzt und anschliessend[CR]mit[CR]dem japanischen Original abgeglichen, wobei Zensuren und[CR]Abersetzungsfehler des englischen Skripts[CR]soweit wie mAPglich ausgebessert[CR]wurden. Danach wurde das Skript im Spiel getestet, wobei[CR]diverse unpassende[CR]Formulierungen abgeA$?ndert wurden.[CR]Die Namen aller Charaktere, StA$?dte,[CR]GegenstA$?nde und Gegner wurden anhand des japanischen Originals[CR]rekonstruiert[CR]und so gut wie mAPglich ins Deutsche A 1/4 bertragen.[CR]Englische und japanische Eigennamen wurden belassen,[CR]wenn es keine[CR]sinnvolle deutsche Abersetzung gab.[CR]Die LA$?nge der Namen aller Charaktere,[CR]Orte, Items, Gegner und ZaubersprA 1/4 che wurde erweitert um auf[CR]unschAPne[CR]AbkA 1/4 rzungen verzichten zu kAPnnen.[CR]-3D-Weltkarte[CR]Um[CR]die grafisch wenig aufregene Weltkarte ein wenig aufzuwerten, wurde ein[CR]Pseudo-3D-Effekt integriert.[CR]Aufgrund diverser technischer Limitationen des[CR]Spiels sowie des SNES fA$?llt dieser zwar eher subtil aus,[CR]trA$?gt aber[CR]dennoch zur Verbesserung der AtmosphA$?re bei.[CR]5. KompatiblitA$?t[CR]Bei[CR]der Entwicklung dieses Patches wurde in erster Linie darauf geachtet, das[CR]Spiel auf einem richtigen SNES[CR]so fehlerfrei wie mAPglich zu gestalten. Da[CR]wir es nicht als unsere Verantwortung sehen, Fehler und[CR]UnzulA$?nglichkeiten[CR]von Emulatoren zu berichtigen, wurde weitestgehend[CR]darauf verzichtet, derartige Fehler zu korrigieren oder zu umgehen.[CR]Die[CR]einzige Ausnahme bildet ein Fehler in der Soundemulation von ZSNES, der dafA[CR]1/4 r sorgt, dass das Originalspiel[CR]von Zeit zu Zeit nach KA$?mpfen abstA[CR]1/4 rzt. Hier wurde die Soundengine des Spiels geringfA 1/4 gig modifiziert,[CR]um derartige[CR]AbstA 1/4 rze zu vermeiden, da die Mehrzahl von euch[CR]vermutlich Zsnes verwenden wird, um den Patch zu spielen.[CR]Empfehlenswert[CR]sind folgende Systeme/Emulatoren:[CR]1. SNES (Originalhardware) - keine[CR]bekannten Probleme[CR]2. Bsnes (Emulator) - nahezu perfekte Emulation, aber[CR]rechenintensiv[CR]3. Zsnes (Emulator) - gute Emulation, leichte Probleme beim[CR]Abspielen der Intromusik, insbesondere im FastForward-Modus[CR]Nicht[CR]empfehlenswert:[CR]Snes9x (Emulator) - durch inakkurate Soundemulation schwere[CR]Probleme beim Abspielen der Intromusik.[CR]6.[CR]Mitwirkende[CR]Abersetzung:[CR]-Bredator[CR]-Reaper84[CR]-d4s[CR]ZusA$?tzliche[CR]Programmierung:[CR]-d4s[CR]ZusA$?tzliche Grafik:[CR]-d4s[CR]ZusA$?tzlicher[CR]Sound:[CR]-d4s[CR]Betatest:[CR]-Bredator[CR]-Reaper84[CR]-Flobo[CR]-Hydr0x</plot>

    <plot>Breath of Fire 2's translation is infamously terrible. From "Yes" and "No"[CR]being swapped to the game asking you to equip a fishing lod and bait, the[CR]writing in the game is bad even by Capcom's low standards. The game itself is[CR]supposed to have a really interesting plot, but the text deteriorates to a[CR]point towards the end that nobody can really make any sense of what's going[CR]on. That said, it's not a bad game. The dragon spells are pretty useless,[CR]unfortunately, but the rest of it is fairly standard RPG fare. The music's[CR]decent, the graphics are good, and the game's fairly tough, but if the meat of[CR]an RPG is the story, this one's so stringy and tough that it drowns out just[CR]about everything else. Hopefully the current translation project will correct[CR]this.[CR]Read Me:[CR]Diese Datei ist inhaltlich identisch mit[CR]"Manual.pdf".[CR]Sie ist nur fA 1/4 r Leute gedacht, die Probleme mit dem[CR]Darstellen von Pdf-Dateien haben.[CR]Inhalt:[CR]1.

It has a "New Game +" mode and 13 different endings[CR](determined by when you choose to battle the final boss) so the replay value[CR]on this one is through the roof.[CR]Read Me:[CR] _________ _ _ _ ______ _[CR]_ _ _______ _ ______[CR]/ ______ \ / \ /\ \ \ / / | ___ \ / \\_____ / \ / \ |[CR]____ \ / \\_____ | ___ \\[CR]\ \ \/ | | / / \ \ / / | | \ \ | _____| | \ | | |[CR]| \ \ | _____| | | \ \\[CR] \ \ | |/ / \ \ / / | |___/ / | | | \ | | | | | | |[CR]| | |___/ /[CR] \ \\___ | / / \ ^ / | ___/ | |_____ | |\ \ | | | | | | |[CR]|_____ | ___/[CR] \\___ \ | \ \ \ / | \ | _____| | | \ \ | | | | | | | _____|[CR]| \\[CR] \ \ | |\ \ | | | |\ \ | | | | \ \| | | | | | | | | |\ \\[CR] \ \ | |[CR]\ \ | | | | \ \ | |_____ | | \ \ | | | | | | |_____ | | \ \\[CR] _______/ / |[CR]| \ \ | | | | \ \ | _____| | | \ | | |____/ / | _____| | | \ \\[CR]/________/[CR]\\_/ \/ \\_/ \\_/ \/ \\_/ \\_/ \\_/ |_______/ \\_/ \\_/ \/[CR] ______ ____ __[CR]_ _ ______ _ __ ______ ______ ______ _ _[CR]|__ __| | __ \ / \ | | | | /[CR]_____\ | | / \ |__ __| |__ __| / __ \ | | | | __[CR] || || \ \ / /\ \ | | | |[CR]\ \ | | / /\ \ || || | / \ | | | | | / \\[CR] || ||__/ / / /__\ \ | \ | | \[CR]\\____ | | / /__\ \ || || | | | | | \ | | \ / _[CR]__||____||___/__|________|_|_\\_\|_|____\\_____\\___|_|______|________|____||_______||____|_|__|_|_|_\\_\|_|____\[CR]\\_______/[CR]\\[CR]/_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________|\[CR]\ \ \ |[CR]|[CR]\\_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________|[CR]\\_\\_\\_\| |[CR] || || \\\ | | | | | | \ | ____/ / | |____ | | | | || __||__[CR]| \\__/ | | | \ | / / \\_/[CR] || || \\\ |_| |_| |_| |_| /_____/ |______| |_|[CR]|_| || |______| \\______/ |_| |_| / \\[CR]\\__/[CR]~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~ ) ) ) Sky Render[CR]Translations ( ( ([CR]~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~[CR]------------------------------[CR]Putting the English back into Japanese-English Translations[CR]------------------------------[CR]_____________________________________________________________________________________________________[CR]/[CR]\\[CR]| DISCLAIMER: Sky Render Translations takes no responsibility for[CR]damages caused to yourself or |[CR]| your PC from using this patch.

    <plot>Clock Tower is a Super Famicom, Point 'n Click Horror adventure game (this[CR]means pointer controls, investigating your environment and puzzle solving).[CR]You play as Jennifer Simpson, an orphan who has been adopted by the owner of a[CR]secluded mansion, along with three other girls. Upon your arrival to the[CR]mansion, all other girls suddenly disappear and you're left there alone in the[CR]mansion's foyer. It's up to Jennifer to find out what's going on and avoid[CR]being killed by the slasher Scissorman. Though be warned, your health is[CR]determined by Jennifer's stamina. The more you run, the faster your stamina[CR]depletes and the harder it becomes to escape Scissorman. Therefore, rest often[CR]and don't run anymore then you need to. The above is coupled with 9 different[CR]endings, determined by who you save and what you discover.[CR]Read[CR]Me:[CR]CLOCK TOWER - THE FIRST FEAR (SFC)[CR]ENGLISH TRANSLATION[CR]V1.01[CR]Copyright 2001 by Aeon[CR]Genesis[CR]http://agtp.romhack.net[CR]ToC[CR]1.About Clock Tower[CR]2.Patch[CR]History[CR]3.Patch Credits[CR]4.Known issues[CR]5.Application[CR]Instructions[CR]6.Mini-FAQ[CR]-------------------[CR]1.About Clock[CR]Tower[CR]-------------------[CR]Clock Tower is a horror/adventure title.

I have[CR]heard that its going to be[CR]fully supported in the next release of[CR]ZSNES; as of this writing, the[CR]current version of ZSNES is[CR]v1.31B.[CR]--------------------------[CR]5.Application[CR]Instructions[CR]--------------------------[CR]If using ZSNES, make sure that[CR]the patch has the same name as your ROM.[CR]In other words, if your ROM is[CR]called "clocktow.smc" make sure the patch[CR]is "clocktow.ips" okay? If youre[CR]using a Mac, a Mac IPS patcher is[CR]available. Check the AGTP Links page. If[CR]youre using a copier, you[CR]probably already know how to patch the ROM :) Be[CR]sure to apply the[CR]patch to a clean copy of the ROM, and make sure your ROM[CR]HAS[CR]a header. If you right-click the ROM and select Properties,[CR]it[CR]should read "Size: 3.00MB (3,146,240 bytes), 3,149,824 bytes bytes[CR]used".[CR]--------------[CR]6. How to[CR]Play[CR]--------------[CR]Controls[CR]--------[CR]Clock Tower - The First Fear[CR]does not support the SNES mouse.

All of the[CR]"safe spots" are listed in Appendix D, but its a[CR]lot more thrilling to find them yourself.[CR]Youll know if youre in Chase[CR]Mode, because (with two or three exceptions) its the only[CR]time that music[CR]will be playing.[CR]During Panic Mode, Jennifers portrait will be flashing.[CR]Hit the B button as fast as you[CR]can to survive Panic Mode.[CR]A note about[CR]Jennifers health:[CR]Your health is shown by the color of Jennifers portrait.[CR]When its blue, youre in very[CR]good (or perfect) health. When its yellow,[CR]youre in good health. When its orange, youre[CR]in bad health, and when its[CR]red youre in very bad/near death status. RUNNING WILL DEPLETE[CR]JENNIFERS[CR]HEALTH! To recover your heatlh, you can sometimes take a drink from the shelf[CR]in[CR]the kitchen, or you can simply hit the X button a few times and wait.[CR]Jennifer will sit down[CR]and her health will slowly recharge. You only need[CR]to be in orange health or better in very[CR]few parts of the game (these will[CR]be marked) so feel free to run anyway. Health is very[CR]unimportant in this[CR]game :)</plot>

    <plot>Cu-on-pa is a puzzle game. I'm finding that as I get older and older, I'm[CR]having less patience for these types of games. But Cu-on-pa is different. It's[CR]just not as annoying as some of the other stuff out there. Maybe that's just[CR]because it isn't a rehash of another puzzle game that's already been done to[CR]death 1500 times (see Tetris and all the crappy block-a-riffic games that[CR]spawned). Either way, I could actually get into this game a little bit, which[CR]is rare for puzzle games these days. Anyhow, in Cu-on-pa, you control this[CR]cube which has various colors on all its faces. On the ground are colored[CR]blocks which you must destroy. To destroy them, you simply roll on them so[CR]that the like-colored face of the cube is face-up while you're on the block.[CR]Yeah, this does sound annoying, but it's not as difficult as it sounds, trust[CR]me. You'll enjoy yourself.

    <plot>Cyber Knight is a really interesting game. It kinda fools you into thinking[CR]it's a sci-fi/mecha RPG with the traditional 8/16-bit RPG engine. Hell,[CR]looking at the screenshots of the overworld, you might be inclined to think it[CR]uses a similar engine to Phantasy Star 2. But that's just the overworld. Once[CR]you get into a battle, it's definitely a strategic game. The battles are waged[CR]on a 6x6 grid. Your fighters have missile and melee attacks, and essentially[CR]you move your men about and attack in a manner that doesn't wind up with your[CR]mechas getting obliterated. The battles are more involved than your standard[CR]RPG fare, and resultedly are a little slow-paced. So those of you who like[CR]Final Fantasy and Dragon Warrior-where you can fly through a battle by hitting[CR]the accept button repeatedly-might not like this. The graphics are a bit[CR]dated, even for 1993. The sound is rather nice, however. And the game play is[CR]decent. So, if you have a grain or two of patience, this game will make for an[CR]enjoyable experience.[CR]Read Me:[CR]CYBER KNIGHT[CR]ENGLISH TRANSLATION[CR]V1.01[CR]Copyright 2001 by Aeon[CR]Genesis[CR]http://agtp.romhack.net[CR]ToC[CR]1.About Cyber Knight[CR]2.Patch[CR]History[CR]3.Patch Credits[CR]4.Known issues[CR]5.Application[CR]Instructions[CR]--------------------[CR]1.About Cyber[CR]Knight[CR]--------------------[CR]Cyber Knight is a nifty little RPG for the[CR]SNES by Group SNE and Tonkinhouse. Its a very[CR]different game and is[CR]probably not quite what youd expect from an "RPG." Combat is more[CR]strategic[CR]than most battle systems as you have freedom of movement, the method of[CR]boosting[CR]your mechs strength is not what youd expect from an RPG either.[CR]and there are a _LOT_ of[CR]planets you can visit. All in all its a very neat[CR]game![CR]---------------[CR]2.Patch History[CR]---------------[CR]The Cyber[CR]Knight project starte... dprobably around September of 2000 or so, when I[CR]found[CR]the ROM, proclaimed that "This kicks ass!" and did a little[CR]preliminary work on it before[CR]finding out that while the script wasnt[CR]compressed, it DID need a custom dumper to[CR]accomodate for the control codes[CR]which draw the variably positioned, variably sized windows.[CR]Round about[CR]March of 2001, Taskforce helped with a script dumper (which turned out to be[CR]a[CR]very slightly modified Thingy) and the project was "officially" started.[CR]Sometime over the[CR]summer, Sogabe popped up online and translated the 180K[CR]script in two days ^^; His english[CR]isnt great though, so I gave the scripts[CR]to Cidolfas of RPGClassics.com who englishized[CR]them in about three days[CR]time.[CR]I sat down for the extremely arduous process of formatting the[CR]scripts for insertion in late[CR]July. The window positions and sizes made[CR]this an especially large pain in the ass: each of[CR]Cyber Kinghts two large[CR]dialogue blocks took about 15 hours of formatting time, whereas[CR]a[CR]comparably large file of the same size without the funky windows would[CR]take about a fifth[CR]of that time :P You can imagine how frustrated I was[CR]when Id gotten it all about 75% done[CR]and the motherboard on the computer I[CR]had everything on died. I still cant get anything off[CR]of that machine; I[CR]had to RE-DO the entire format process. UGH. Thats what led to my[CR]burnout[CR]in August, if anyones wondering :P[CR]Anyways, a few months (and many hours of[CR]formatting) later, Cyber Knights done![CR]December 17, 2001 - Version[CR]1.01[CR]-Fixes window overflow when examining planets of "medium gas giant"[CR]specification[CR]-Fixes Pockets cavespeak for two or three of the[CR]modules[CR]-Maybe fixes Japanese on the save screen, I forget if I fixed it or[CR]not.[CR]November 17, 2001 - Initial version 1.00[CR]Release[CR]---------------[CR]3.Patch Credits[CR]---------------[CR]THE CYBER[CR]KNIGHT TEAM[CR]Gideon Zhi - Project leader, lead romhacker, assembly[CR]work[CR]Sogabe - Translator[CR]Cidolfas - Scriptwriter[CR]Taskforce - Script[CR]dumper[CR]--------------[CR]4.Known Issues[CR]--------------[CR]-During combat[CR]attack cutscenes, enemies are not labelled[CR]properly.[CR]-The first two[CR]screens still contain Japanese.[CR]-Occasionally, when refining neoparts, "g"[CR]will output instead[CR]of the enemys name.

    <plot>This looks like a pretty cool game. And it's developed by Westone, the[CR]Wonderboy guys. Quite a turnaround! Anyways it's an RPG played out from an[CR]isometric perspective. Battles are a little tactical, kind of like, oh, I[CR]don't know, like Rhapsody if you've played that, where you move by squares and[CR]end turns and stuff. The antagonist of the game seems to be SATAN. Which is[CR]pretty cool I guess. Those Westone guys sure don't mess around. And the main[CR]character has a brother named Jose.

Features[CR]4. Patch Credits and Contributors[CR]5. Known[CR]issues[CR]6.

The player then takes control[CR]of[CR]the Fallen One as he wanders the earth and absorbs the souls[CR]of the[CR]living. When the morning dawns, the player takes[CR]control of Falco, a knight[CR]tasked with protecting the human[CR]race. Each night, control switches back to[CR]the Fallen One,[CR]and each morning control switches back to Falco.[CR]The[CR]plot is actually really well-written. Its very much[CR]black-and-white at the[CR]start, but by the time Judgment Day[CR]rolls around and the game gives you the[CR]option to pick[CR]sides, the choice is much less stark. The game itself[CR]does[CR]some interesting things with RPG conventions too.[CR]---------------[CR]2.Patch History[CR]---------------[CR]Dark Half has a[CR]really rather varied history, and I suppose[CR]if I were to start at the[CR]beginning, but the problem is that[CR]Im not sure exactly where tha beginning[CR]is! This projcet[CR]originated with another group, SirYoinks Klepto[CR]Translations,[CR]back in... god, 1999? 2000? I dont even know. I[CR]honestly[CR]dont have a lot of information on the history of Yoinks[CR]version[CR]of the patch, just that it seemed to progress in[CR]brief fits and starts. He[CR]managed to get the script dumped,[CR]after a fashion, and Eien ni Hen[CR]translated. The last version[CR]released in 2011 and featured some noticeable[CR]improvements[CR]over previous versions, most visibly including a half-[CR]width[CR]font. Yoink reports this has containing roughly half of the[CR]games[CR]dialog. [CR]Fastforward to August of 2014. Pennywise of Stardust[CR]Crusaders[CR](http://yojimbo.eludevisibility.org/) interviewed Eien ni[CR]Hen[CR]for a podcast, ad she talked about Dark Half for a while.[CR]This was[CR]one of the games that got me into romhacking in the[CR]first place, and every[CR]few years I followed up on the status[CR]of the project and thought vaguely[CR]about starting up my own[CR]version, but Yoink was an old friend and I didnt[CR]really want[CR]to step on any toes. But after the podcast went up I[CR]decided[CR]to see about dumping the script from the game and sent[CR]a[CR]tentative email to Yoink, giving him full veto power over[CR]the project.[CR]After he gave his blessing the project moved[CR]forward into full gear and I[CR]passed the new script dump over[CR]to Eien ni Hen, who dropped her earlier[CR]translation into it.[CR]The rest, as they say, is history.

    <plot>Dark Law is the sequel to Dark Lord, the third part in a trilogy of[CR]tangentially-related games (think Soul Blazer/Illusion of Gaia/Terranigma.)[CR]Whereas the second game in the series, Wizap!, kind of stinks, Dark Law is[CR]fully of all kinds of awesome. Combat plays similarly to Treasure Hunter G, if[CR]you've played that, except it's not grid based - you have a power bar that[CR]decreases as you move, and the more it has left in it the more attacks you can[CR]make in a single turn. It's also got multiple endings! Dark Law is essentially[CR]the Japanese interpretation of the pencil-and-paper RPG into a videogame[CR]format. The focus is rather heavy on exploration and light on combat, with[CR]copious amounts of storytelling thrown in for good measure. It, like Dark Lord[CR]before it, is told through a series of short stories ("Scenarios") which tie[CR]together by the final conclusion. It's a pretty cool game, on the[CR]whole.[CR]Read Me:[CR]DARK LAW ~ MEANING OF DEATH[CR]ENGLISH TRANSLATION[CR]V1.00[CR]Copyright 2007 by Aeon[CR]Genesis[CR]http://agtp.romhack.net[CR]ToC[CR]0.

Application Instructions[CR]6.[CR]Troubleshooting[CR]------------------[CR]0.Before You[CR]Begin[CR]------------------[CR]Dark Law has evidenced a few issues with[CR]emulators. These include the[CR]corruption of sprites after a battle in the[CR]"King of the Abyss" scenario[CR]and the corruption of the palette during "The[CR]Search." These were[CR]duplicatable in the Japanese version, and as such are[CR]probably not caused[CR]by the patch.[CR]----------------[CR]1.About Dark[CR]Law[CR]----------------[CR]Dark Law is a rather nontraditional RPG for the[CR]SNES. It focuses on[CR]exploration and storytelling over combat; some of the[CR]skills that the[CR]players characters can learn are even useful for the[CR]adventure mode.[CR]It is told through a series of short vignettes[CR]("Scenarios.") Some are[CR]interrelated, but most are essentially standalone.[CR]It is a very dark[CR]and macabre game, probably not good to play if youre[CR]depressed, but it[CR]does some very interesting things with the genre as a[CR]whole. It feels[CR]like Dark Law was trying to be a pencil and paper game, but[CR]was coated with[CR]a layer of J-RPG paint. Its quite[CR]good.[CR]---------------[CR]2.Patch History[CR]---------------[CR]Dark Law was[CR]started... oh god, I dont even remember when. Years ago,[CR]certainly; it[CR]originally belonged to Haeleth, who passed it off to me[CR]last July, and I[CR]promptly sat on it and did nothing. I picked it up[CR]just after Christmas,[CR]spending much of the State of the Union address[CR]working on the first (of[CR]many) variable-width font routines that the[CR]game would receive.[CR]It[CR]currently stands at 15 font routine hacks: 3 8x16s, 2 8x8s, and[CR]TEN[CR]VWFs.[CR]In retrospect, the project was probably more trouble that it was[CR]worth,[CR]but hey, its done and Im not complaining.[CR]March 7, 2007 - Initial[CR]Version 1.00 release[CR]---------------[CR]3.Patch[CR]Credits[CR]---------------[CR]THE DARK LAW TEAM[CR]Gideon Zhi - Project[CR]leader, romhacker, assembly hacker[CR]Haeleth - Script Translation[CR]SPECIAL[CR]THANKS[CR]Huge props to my betatesters for not only completing the game in[CR]such a[CR]timely fashion, but also for being so dilligent in reporting the[CR]numerous[CR]issues that remained in the beta patch.

I BELIEVE this to be[CR] a side-effect of another issue we squashed in[CR]the meantime, but I cant[CR] be sure. If you encounter anything like this,[CR]PLEASE let us know.[CR]--Character sprites can get corrupted after a battle in[CR]the "King of the Abyss"[CR] scenario.

If you right-click the ROM and select Properties,[CR]it[CR]should read "Size: 4.00 MB (4,194,304 bytes)". SNESTool will remove[CR]all[CR]of your headers for you easily, and you can find it[CR]at[CR]http://www.romhacking.net[CR]In the Utilities section, simply search for[CR]snestool.[CR]An easy way to tell if the game has a header or not is that if[CR]you[CR]apply the patch and the game does not boot, your game very likely[CR]does[CR]not have a[CR]header.[CR]-----------------[CR]6.Troubleshooting[CR]-----------------[CR]--If[CR]the game does not run at all, read the above section on[CR] application[CR]instructions (specifically on header removal.)[CR] Make sure your ROM is not[CR]read-only when you remove its header.[CR]--If McStarr or Antoniana are[CR]corrupted, LET ME KNOW. Thank you.[CR]--If the game crashes due to a sprite[CR]corruption after a battle in "King of[CR] the Abyss" its probably an emulator[CR]issue. Sorry.[CR]--If the palette gets corrupted during "The Search" its[CR]probably an emulator[CR] issue. Sorry.</plot>

    <plot>This is one of those block-a-riffic puzzle games, where giant blocks fall from[CR]the sky, and you have to prevent them from stacking up too high, while dueling[CR]an opponent. Why? Because stacking them too high causes the sky to fall, or[CR]something catastrophic like that-leaving you vulnerable to your opponent's[CR]attack. So what do you do? You match up three or more like-colored blocks.[CR]This causes them to disappear in a magical flash. But not only that, but[CR]depending on which blocks you vanquish, it unleashes an attack on your[CR]opponent. You win when you kill your opponent, or when your opponent's blocks[CR]stack up too high. Yeah. I know. It's Columns with a twist. Anyway, I suck at[CR]these block-a-riffic puzzle games, so I lost alot. But you know what? It's[CR]still helluva fun. Check it out.[CR]Read Me:[CR]SFC Dossun!

The new hack lets you use the[CR]in-game save function without any problem and so,[CR]you should also be able[CR]to use the translation on real hardware.[CR]The new hack also features a[CR]bigger and proper VWF font, as well as a lot of free space to fit text so most[CR]of the abbreviations used by the old[CR]patch were removed (the only few[CR]abbreviations still in the new patch are some attack names and a few character[CR]names in the ending credits because[CR]there isnt enough free space on the[CR]screen to display those full sentences, even if we have enough free space in[CR]the rom).[CR]First, I had to copy and paste the old incomplete translation[CR](~2000 lines) in the new text dumps because of some pointers incompatibility.[CR]After a while, methos8 joined me and helped with the old translation in[CR]the new text dumps and he also worked on the first editing[CR]of the text[CR]since the old patch.[CR]Schrieker then joined the team (January 18, 2011) to[CR]do some translation of the untranslated text, did a good chunk of the[CR]remaining text[CR]then disappeared from the board on August 30, 2011. He came[CR]back later (May 5th, 2013) but meanwhile, I had completed the two files he[CR]started[CR]to translate and finally decided to complete the remaining[CR]translation myself.[CR]Then methos8 disappeared from the board and I got[CR]exasperated about the editing process and planned to drop the revival of[CR]this[CR]project (December 11, 2014) as I wasnt motivated anymore to search for[CR]new editors who might disappear again after a while and I wasnt[CR]also[CR]motivated to translate the remaining untranslated text before the[CR]editing of the old translation would be complete.[CR]Then, on January 6, 2015,[CR]a miracle occured! Someone contacted me (Pie-Her) and seemed really motivated[CR]to do the editing.[CR]And you know what? This time, this editor stayed until[CR]the end of the project!!!![CR]I can even say that most people can thank Pie-[CR]Her which would often e-mail me to know if there was any new text to edit,[CR]which motivated me[CR]to keep working on the project until the end.[CR]At the[CR]end of this year (2016), I finally decided I would release a beta patch before[CR]the end of the year to show people the project wasnt dead[CR]and was still[CR]being worked on. We are the last day of the year, December 31 (at least in my[CR]country!), the beta patch is ready and Im actually writing[CR]this readme file[CR]before publishing the[CR]patch.[CR]-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]****************************************[CR]*[CR]Informations about the translation :[CR]*[CR]****************************************[CR]- A few sentences in the[CR]patch are still untranslated (some useless ones which often appear before[CR]and/or after a save point). A part of those sentences are[CR]translated though[CR](the ones which give advices, so the useful ones).[CR]- Line-breaks might also[CR]not be the best for most of the dialogs as for now, its an auto-wrapping[CR]routine done by the inserter.[CR] I fixed the big problems (words cut between[CR]lines) and started to work on manual line-breaks but itll take a while to put[CR]them in the whole script[CR] so manual line-breaks will only be available in[CR]the final version of the patch.[CR]- I also noticed that a few battle dialogs[CR]werent translated but I never encountered them in-game (I saw some[CR]untranslated dialogs in the battle text file [CR] but I havent found any[CR]untranslated battle dialogs yet in the game). I havent double-checked yet, but[CR]I guess it might be some dialogs which only appear [CR] when you lose a fight[CR](which would explain why I never saw them, as I play with some Pro Action[CR]Replay codes to have maxed stats and make battles faster xD).[CR]- Except[CR]those little things, the game should be fully playable (some sentences in the[CR]main script might be missing, as I tried to check most[CR] of the choices,[CR]which gave alternate dialogs but I cant be sure to have tested all of them.[CR]From what I saw, ~100 dialogs out of 5101 dialogs wont be[CR] translated in[CR]the beta-patch as we need to get some info about where to find those dialogs[CR]in-game to get some context. If you find any untranslated dialogs[CR] or even[CR]other problems, feel free to send a screenshot and a little explanation of how[CR]you found them to scripts-elysion (at) hiei-tf.fr and I will translate [CR]those untranslated dialogs).[CR]- I created two versions of the patch. The[CR]first one features character names from the anime. The editing has been made[CR]with those names. I quickly created[CR] an alternative version of the patch[CR]which feature the characters names from the manga, for those who might prefer[CR]them, so I might have missed a few character[CR] names when I did the[CR]"search/replace", but I think I covered nearly all of[CR]them.[CR]-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]*************************************[CR]*[CR]Information about the patching :[CR]*[CR]*************************************[CR]The patchs are using the classic[CR]IPS format so just use any IPS patcher to apply the translation. I personally[CR]used LunarIPS to create those patchs, but[CR]you should be able to use[CR]whatever IPS patcher you want to apply the translation.[CR]You need to apply[CR]this IPS patch on a japanese "Dragon Ball Z Gokuuden Totsugeki-Hen". Those[CR]patchs were created from the no-intro dump so I would advice[CR]using this one[CR](its the most widespread one. Checksum of the japanese rom is[CR]"D531289B").[CR]After patching, the checksum of the patched rom with the anime[CR]version should be "3561FF9D" and the checksum of the patched rom with the[CR]manga version[CR]should be[CR]"48C377F0".[CR]-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]*******************************[CR]*[CR]English localization staff: *[CR]*******************************[CR]-[CR]Romhacking, Programming, Assembler: Neige[CR]- Translation: Old Kakkoii[CR]Translations staff ; Schrieker ; Hiei-[CR]- Editing: Old Kakkoii Translations[CR]staff ; methos8 ; Pie-Her[CR]- Graphics: Neige[CR]- Beta-test: Hiei-[CR]-[CR]Special Thanks: kakkoiitranslations.net ; romhack.org ; mobygames.com ;[CR]romhacking.net[CR]-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]If[CR]you need help with the few "mazes" the game features, check this link :[CR]http://www.kakkoiitranslations.net/phpBB/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t;=278</plot>

    <plot>Dragon Ball Z: Super Gokuden - Kakusei Hen is a role playing game for the[CR]Super Nintendo. This game picks up right where Dragon Ball Z Gokuden left off,[CR]starting with Goku before the 23th tournament and going to the end of the[CR]Freeza Saga. As far as gameplay, it's pretty much the same thing: watch people[CR]talk and occasionally make choices to influence to conversation, and every so[CR]often fight some guys, but not often.[CR]Read Me:[CR]---------------------------------[CR] | Dragon Ball Z - Gokuden 2 |[CR]---------------------------------[CR]++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++[CR] + Unofficial English[CR]Translation +[CR] ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++[CR] +[CR]By The Commando Ginew +[CR] + http://www.ginew.cjb.net +[CR]++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++[CR]----------------------------------------------------------[CR]C O N T E N T[CR]S[CR]----------------------------------------------------------[CR]1.[CR]Introduction[CR]2.

This project started on 21/03/00. Im the only person whos doing[CR]the patch itself. Some people helped me thought: Jace with the site, maverick[CR]with the readme, Gotenpal with some fixes in the dialogs, and other people who[CR]supported[CR]me.[CR]----------------------------------------------------------[CR]2. Patch[CR]Info[CR]----------------------------------------------------------[CR]What is[CR]completed in this patch:[CR]1. All story-text [CR]2. Battle text [CR]3.

What helpers says will[CR]stay[CR]Japanese[CR]----------------------------------------------------------[CR]3.[CR]How to Start[CR]----------------------------------------------------------[CR]The archive includes an IPS file. The IPS file is to be applied to ROM images[CR]acquired from somewhere else, and its up to you to obtain it.[CR] First, you[CR]need a copy of the Dragon Ball Z - Gokuden 2 ROM image, and an IPS patching[CR]program. The most popular one is Snestool that you can get at most emulaton[CR]sites. This patch MUST be applied to the ORIGINAL, unmodified ROM image.[CR]To use Snestool with the Dragon Ball Z - Gokuden 2 patch (dbz.ips), double[CR]click to start it up and press U to start the patching process. Next find the[CR]dbz.ips file in whatever directory you saved it and press enter. Now find the[CR]ORIGIONAL unmodified ROM image in whatever directory you saved it and press[CR]enter. The ROM image is now patched. After youve patched your ROM image, load[CR]the game inside your favorite SNES emulator, and youre ready to[CR]start.[CR]----------------------------------------------------------[CR]4.[CR]Reflection[CR]----------------------------------------------------------[CR]Im happy to have translated such a great and BIG game. I hope you people will[CR]enjoy playing it as much as I enjoyed translating[CR]it.[CR]----------------------------------------------------------[CR]5.[CR]Disclaimer[CR]----------------------------------------------------------[CR]Dragon[CR]Ball Z - Gokuden 2 and all other likenesses are copyright of Banai.[CR](c)[CR]2001 by The Commando Ginew[CR] There is no video game company or any other[CR]company associated with The Commando Ginew.

See Section 5) and you should see[CR]the title screen within[CR]a few seconds. Press any button to go on. Youre[CR]ready to start.[CR]More detailed instructions for things such as copiers and[CR]variations on the [CR]format of the DQ1&amp;2 ROM can be found at[CR]http://www.dragonfire.net/~shadow1/[CR]------------------------------------[CR]2a.[CR]Controller functions:[CR]D-Pad: Move lead character in all 4 directions, move[CR]cursor up/down, in[CR] battle, move cursor all the way left or right to target[CR]a group of[CR] enemies or allies[CR]A Button: Menu[CR]B Button: No[CR]function[CR]X Button: Search/Talk/Door (depends on whats nearby)[CR]Y Button:[CR]No function[CR]Start : No function[CR]Select : No function[CR]L Button:\\[CR]&gt; Same as X[CR]R Button:/[CR]------------------------------------[CR]2b.

You can[CR]use Items, Equip[CR]stuff, see your Magic list, see your Status, and[CR]Search.[CR]------------------------------------[CR]2c. Advanced Battle[CR]Tactics[CR]1. Target enemies weaknesses. (i.e. use an Ice spell on a fiery[CR]creature,[CR]use Lightning on anything that lives in water, and use Fire on[CR]any frozen[CR]creatures). This will do more damage on them than usual. [Ed: I[CR]didnt[CR]think DQ1&amp;2 had elemental magics.][CR]2. Curative-type spells do good[CR]damage on Undead creatures (zombies,[CR]skeletons, ghosts, etc.) [Ed: I didnt[CR]think this one worked either!][CR]3. Take some time in leveling up just before[CR]you enter a new area. Itll be[CR] worth it! [Ed: Now this is sound[CR]advice!][CR]------------------------------------[CR]2d.

[CR]The king of[CR]Tantagel castle stored these spheres for him after Edrick passed [CR]on. Many[CR]warriors tried to get the spheres from the Dragon Lords castle where [CR]the[CR]King of Tantagel hid them but none returned. Then there was a legend of[CR]one of Edricks descendants defeating the Dragon Lord. You are Edricks[CR]descendent and it is now your duty to save the land from the evil Dragon[CR]Lord. [CR]Dragon Quest 2[CR]--------------[CR]Again, same thing with[CR]Erdrick. Erdricks descendant who defeated the Dragon [CR]Lord came to this[CR]land with Princess Gwaelin. Together, they built Torland. [CR]Princess Gwaelin[CR]had three children, the oldest son got Midenhall, the [CR]youngest son got[CR]Cannock, and the princess got Moonbrooke. Peace [CR]went on for 100 years.[CR]Now, you, descendent of the eldest son have to [CR]defend the land after the[CR]rescent devastation of Moonbrooke by[CR]Hargon.[CR]-----------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]4.[CR]Which Emus/Copiers do DQ1&amp;2 work on?[CR]Compatibility list for emulators as of[CR]Dec. 13, 1997:[CR]-----------------------------------------------------[CR]1.[CR]Esnes v. 0.14: Amazingly enough, this is the emulator of choice for this [CR]game! Everything except those cool little transparent [CR] shadows for the[CR]enemies! (Timkos opinion, not mine)[CR]2. Snes9x DOS v. 0.20/0.24: Sound[CR]emulation a little off. Missing [CR] transparencies.[CR]3. Snes9x WIN v. 0.24:[CR]Same here, except slower than its DOS ver.[CR]4. ZSnes v. 0.20b: 5 second[CR]delay on loading BG music, can be irritating.[CR] Each time you take a step[CR]the screen flashes as if youre [CR] poisoned (even if you really arent).[CR]However, if you have[CR] VESA 2.0 support (Scitech Display Doctor), you can[CR]see the [CR] transparencies![CR]5. NLKSnes v. 0.14b: Has 256 color[CR]transparencies, but lacks sound.[CR]6. SPW v. 1.3a: Sprite alignment is off.[CR]Character spacing is off. [CR] (discontinued)[CR]7. SPW v. 1.7a: Non-playable.[CR](discontinued)[CR]8. VSMC v. 9702d: Pretty good, could be better, costs $35 to[CR]actually see what[CR] youre doing. (disccontinued)[CR]?. SNEeSe v. 10: ???[CR](Havent tried)[CR]Copiers:[CR]Most all copiers are compatible with DQ1&amp;2, but[CR]some (e.g. Professor SF2,[CR]Game Doctor series) will need a conversion in[CR]Ucon or Snestool to get the ROM[CR]into the format that they use. For more[CR]information, see[CR]http://www.dragonfire.net/~shadow1/[CR]-----------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]5.[CR]Problems with Emus[CR]-None (well there is a little bit of incoherant garbage[CR]when fading[CR] in snes9x[CR].24)[CR]-----------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]6.[CR]Problems w/ Translation:[CR]- Space is one problem with ROM hacking. We have[CR]to shorten a lot of things to [CR] make them fit. If we had our way, we[CR]wouldnt shorten things now, would we?[CR] (This is becoming less of a problem[CR]as you may have noticed)[CR]- Ive caught word that there exist bonus dungeons[CR]in DQ2, so if anyone can point me in[CR] that general direction.. itll be[CR]translated.. if not.. then I guess you all[CR]suffer.[CR]-----------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]7.[CR]Special Thanks to Those who Made This Possible:[CR]- David Timko! for getting[CR]me off my lazy butt and helping me whup up on the enemy.[CR]- Whoever wrote[CR]Naga, the best editor yet!

See Section 5) and you should see[CR]the title screen within[CR]a few seconds. Press any button to go on. Youre[CR]ready to start.[CR]More detailed instructions for things such as copiers and[CR]variations on the [CR]format of the DQ1&amp;2 ROM can be found at[CR]http://www.dragonfire.net/~shadow1/[CR]------------------------------------[CR]2a.[CR]Controller functions:[CR]D-Pad: Move lead character in all 4 directions, move[CR]cursor up/down, in[CR] battle, move cursor all the way left or right to target[CR]a group of[CR] enemies or allies[CR]A Button: Menu[CR]B Button: No[CR]function[CR]X Button: Search/Talk/Door (depends on whats nearby)[CR]Y Button:[CR]No function[CR]Start : No function[CR]Select : No function[CR]L Button:\\[CR]&gt; Same as X[CR]R Button:/[CR]------------------------------------[CR]2b. The[CR]Menu Screen[CR]The Menu Screen is the most important thing in DQ1&amp;2\. You can[CR]use Items, Equip[CR]stuff, see your Magic list, see your Status, and[CR]Search.[CR]------------------------------------[CR]2c. Advanced Battle[CR]Tactics[CR]1. Target enemies weaknesses. (i.e. use an Ice spell on a fiery[CR]creature,[CR]use Lightning on anything that lives in water, and use Fire on[CR]any frozen[CR]creatures). This will do more damage on them than usual. [Ed: I[CR]didnt[CR]think DQ1&amp;2 had elemental magics.][CR]2. Curative-type spells do good[CR]damage on Undead creatures (zombies,[CR]skeletons, ghosts, etc.) [Ed: I didnt[CR]think this one worked either!][CR]3. Take some time in leveling up just before[CR]you enter a new area. Itll be[CR] worth it! [Ed: Now this is sound[CR]advice!][CR]------------------------------------[CR]2d. Abnormal[CR]"Conditions":[CR]In battle and Out of battle:[CR]- Poisoned = Your HP decrease[CR]as you walk, use an antidote or visit the Cleric [CR] to get detoxicated.[CR]-[CR]Cursed = Much like poision except the only way to be saved is by seeing a [CR]cleric and choosing uncurse.[CR]- Dead = You are dead, you aint coming back[CR]unless you have a leaf of the [CR] world tree or you visit a Cleric and pay to[CR]be[CR]revived.[CR]-----------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]3.[CR]The Story of DQ[CR]Dragon Quest 1[CR]--------------[CR]Long ago, Erdrick (your[CR]ancestor) was a great hero who brought the land of [CR]Alfgeard from the[CR]darkness using the special globes given to him by a freind. [CR]The king of[CR]Tantagel castle stored these spheres for him after Edrick passed [CR]on. Many[CR]warriors tried to get the spheres from the Dragon Lords castle where [CR]the[CR]King of Tantagel hid them but none returned. Then there was a legend of[CR]one of Edricks descendants defeating the Dragon Lord. You are Edricks[CR]descendent and it is now your duty to save the land from the evil Dragon[CR]Lord. [CR]Dragon Quest 2[CR]--------------[CR]Again, same thing with[CR]Erdrick. Erdricks descendant who defeated the Dragon [CR]Lord came to this[CR]land with Princess Gwaelin. Together, they built Torland. [CR]Princess Gwaelin[CR]had three children, the oldest son got Midenhall, the [CR]youngest son got[CR]Cannock, and the princess got Moonbrooke. Peace [CR]went on for 100 years.[CR]Now, you, descendent of the eldest son have to [CR]defend the land after the[CR]rescent devastation of Moonbrooke by[CR]Hargon.[CR]-----------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]4.[CR]Which Emus/Copiers do DQ1&amp;2 work on?[CR]Compatibility list for emulators as of[CR]Dec. 13, 1997:[CR]-----------------------------------------------------[CR]1.[CR]Esnes v. 0.14: Amazingly enough, this is the emulator of choice for this [CR]game! Everything except those cool little transparent [CR] shadows for the[CR]enemies! (Timkos opinion, not mine)[CR]2. Snes9x DOS v. 0.20/0.24: Sound[CR]emulation a little off. Missing [CR] transparencies.[CR]3. Snes9x WIN v. 0.24:[CR]Same here, except slower than its DOS ver.[CR]4. ZSnes v. 0.20b: 5 second[CR]delay on loading BG music, can be irritating.[CR] Each time you take a step[CR]the screen flashes as if youre [CR] poisoned (even if you really arent).[CR]However, if you have[CR] VESA 2.0 support (Scitech Display Doctor), you can[CR]see the [CR] transparencies![CR]5. NLKSnes v. 0.14b: Has 256 color[CR]transparencies, but lacks sound.[CR]6. SPW v. 1.3a: Sprite alignment is off.[CR]Character spacing is off. [CR] (discontinued)[CR]7. SPW v. 1.7a: Non-playable.[CR](discontinued)[CR]8. VSMC v. 9702d: Pretty good, could be better, costs $35 to[CR]actually see what[CR] youre doing. (disccontinued)[CR]?. SNEeSe v. 10: ???[CR](Havent tried)[CR]Copiers:[CR]Most all copiers are compatible with DQ1&amp;2, but[CR]some (e.g. Professor SF2,[CR]Game Doctor series) will need a conversion in[CR]Ucon or Snestool to get the ROM[CR]into the format that they use. For more[CR]information, see[CR]http://www.dragonfire.net/~shadow1/[CR]-----------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]5.[CR]Problems with Emus[CR]-None (well there is a little bit of incoherant garbage[CR]when fading[CR] in snes9x[CR].24)[CR]-----------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]6.[CR]Problems w/ Translation:[CR]- Space is one problem with ROM hacking. We have[CR]to shorten a lot of things to [CR] make them fit. If we had our way, we[CR]wouldnt shorten things now, would we?[CR] (This is becoming less of a problem[CR]as you may have noticed)[CR]- Ive caught word that there exist bonus dungeons[CR]in DQ2, so if anyone can point me in[CR] that general direction.. itll be[CR]translated.. if not.. then I guess you all[CR]suffer.[CR]-----------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]7.[CR]Special Thanks to Those who Made This Possible:[CR]- David Timko! for getting[CR]me off my lazy butt and helping me whup up on the enemy.[CR]- Whoever wrote[CR]Naga, the best editor yet! (now, about that 8-bit plane support...)[CR]-[CR]P-Funk for finding that blasted 0x32 that was hiding from me...[CR][other[CR]Thanks removed because I didnt write them in the first[CR]place][CR]----------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]8.[CR]RPGe[CR]The following is a list of the members of RPGe:[CR]- Shadow [CR]-[CR]Hooie (D.

    <plot>Dragon Quest III received a Super Famicom remake in 1996, 8 years after it's[CR]original Famicom release. This remake brings the game's presentation in league[CR]with Dragon Quest VI and stands as the most loved and cherished version of[CR]Dragon Quest III to date.[CR]Read Me:[CR] ________ 28-February-98[CR] / \[CR]___________[CR] .\\_ _ \\......./ \\.............[CR] : / / \ \ \\_____[CR]__/[J3d!] :[CR] :/ / / / \ \ /----\ :[CR] / / / //-----\ / // \[CR]/--------\\[CR]/- --- // _ \ ___/ // /\ \ / ____ \\[CR]\\__________// // // //[CR]/ \ \\\ \ / /[CR] : \ \\\ / \\_____/ \ ----\ \\\ \/ /[CR] : \ ----\[CR]\\______/\\__/ \ \\__/[CR] :...........\\______/.......................\[CR]\\[CR] [s N E S r O M t R A N S L A T I O N S] \\__/[CR] Dragon Quest 3 remix[CR]Translation v0.14[CR] ======================================[CR]What is[CR]this?[CR]-------------[CR] This is a patch to convert the Super Famicom[CR]game[CR]Dragon Quest 3 remix into English. Dragon Quest 3 Remix[CR]is a[CR]greatly improved version of the original NES game.[CR]The graphics and sound[CR]are much higher quality than the[CR]original, but thankfully, the classic[CR]story and gameplay[CR]remains the same :).[CR] This translation is now a joint[CR]effort between Drayman[CR]Darklight and DeJap translations. This is because[CR]the[CR]game coding and compression schemes are virtually the[CR]same as for[CR]Dragon Quest 6, so it makes sense to use the[CR]same patching code for both[CR]games. You can expect this[CR]translation to make use of any improvements that[CR]are made[CR]to the DQ6 patch. Also, this game has about half as much[CR]text[CR]as DQ6, so you can expect it to be completed a lot[CR]more quickly! Please ask[CR]before uploading this patch[CR]anywhere else, dont stick it on your page[CR]without[CR]permission (like some people have done, nngrh...). [CR] If you see[CR]any translations that are not 100% accurate,[CR]please tell one of us, but[CR]dont complain... We try our best...[CR]How to use it[CR]-------------[CR]Firstly, you will need a copy of Dragon Quest 3r[CR]in .smc (Super Magicom?)[CR]format. Note: it is illegal[CR]to own this for more than 24-hours, unless you[CR]also[CR]own the original game cartridge! This file should be[CR]named Dq3r.smc[CR]and should contain the standard[CR]512 byte header. It can be either in[CR]interleaved or[CR]deinterleaved format (I think I got my copy[CR]from[CR]Snesmerism, and it was interleaved, but Draymans copy[CR]is[CR]deinterleaved...).[CR] Copy all files in this archive into the[CR]same[CR]directory as the rom, then run the MakeDQ3e.bat file.[CR]This will[CR]patch the rom for you. Now, try it out on[CR]either a real snes or a snes[CR]emulator. The new rom[CR]will be called Dragon3e.smc, the original rom[CR]will[CR]not be altered.[CR]Important![CR]----------[CR]* If you plan to apply[CR]the patch yourself, make sure you[CR] have run DQ3DeInt.exe correctly BEFORE[CR]applying the ips[CR] to it (or it wont run).[CR]* Also, if you run it on an[CR]emulator you MUST HAVE SOUND[CR] ENABLED (Snes9x, Zsnes).[CR]* Always apply[CR]the patch to a copy of the original ROM,[CR] this is VERY[CR]IMPORTANT...[CR]Whats New[CR]----------[CR]v0.14[CR]- Script mostly done[CR]for:[CR] Noanielu Village[CR] Elf Village[CR] Najima Tower[CR] Shanpane[CR]Tower[CR] DreamRuby Cave[CR] Elf Village (After Ruby)[CR] Night -Kanave[CR]Village[CR] -Romaly Village[CR] -Aliahan Village[CR] -Reeve Village[CR] 2[CR]Spell effects[CR] (All these translations by Drayman!).[CR]- A copule of menus[CR]are expanded (not properly yet,[CR] only the text itself, not the window[CR]boxes...).[CR]v0.12[CR]- Script mostly done for:[CR] Tower of Shanpane[CR]Kanave village[CR] Romalia Castle (including the Fight Ring)[CR] Register Lady[CR]in Aliahan[CR]- Some more Monster names done.[CR]- Some spell texts (mainly[CR]failures, like casting[CR] return in a cave, or MP too low).[CR]v0.10[CR]-[CR]16x16 text translations for most shops, some[CR] of the character generation[CR]text and a fair[CR] number of the characters in the first town.[CR]- All the[CR]work from Draymans translation is[CR] included (so a lot of the 8x8 text is[CR]translated).[CR]- Some 8x8 text has been expanded (mainly spell[CR]names).[CR]Internal Changes:[CR]- All features of the DQ6 patch are[CR]implemented,[CR] at least as far as 16x16 text/font/compression[CR] is[CR]concerned.

    <plot>If you like the old-school RPG "flava," than you will love Dragon Quest V.[CR]This is the first Dragon Quest game to appear on the Super Famicom, so it[CR]isn't that innovative compared to the NES installments. The graphics are[CR]barely a step up from Dragon Quest IV, and the basic game engine is still the[CR]same (not that it has undergone much change at all to this day, besides the[CR]addition of a Job system in DQVI and DQVII). The story revolves around the son[CR]of Papas, who is either a King or a wandering mercenary. That's for you to[CR]figure out. Of course, you play as Papas' son. The beginning part of the game[CR]focus on your (mis) adventures as you follow Papas around while he carries out[CR]various jobs, at the tender age of six. This abruptly ends when tragedy[CR]strikes and you end up in bondage (no, not THAT kind of bondage). You[CR]eventually escape via a plot device stolen entirely from J.R.R. Tolkien, and[CR]arrive back at your hometown some ten years later, only to find that the[CR]region has been more or less turned upside-down in your absence. You of course[CR]have to set things right, and this of course sends on a much larger quest,[CR]eventually following the footsteps of your father. One of the interesting[CR]things in Dragon Quest V's game play that makes it slightly more than a[CR]beefed-up Dragon Quest IV is the ability to capture monsters after battle.[CR]Now, monster capturing does appear in all of the later Dragon Quest games, but[CR]it plays a much larger role in this installment, since for most of the game at[CR]least one of your two companions in battle will be a monster you captured. It[CR]adds a little depth to your battle strategy because anywhere that your[CR]carriage is accessible, you can hot-swap monsters in and out of the fight.[CR]This becomes necessary because monsters all have strengths and weaknesses that[CR]can either help or hinder you. And you have to choose wisely whom you take[CR]into dungeons and towers since you can't usually hot-swap once you're inside.[CR]You're stuck with whom you take, so choose wisely. All in all, this is a very[CR]enjoyable game. As of this writing, there are two translations available for[CR]the game, and both are well done and will see you through to the[CR]end.[CR]Read Me:[CR]Dragon Quest 5 english translation[CR]by Zealsoft[CR]Translation Corp.[CR]-V0.085-[CR]-Whats New?-[CR]V0.085[CR]Not Much[CR]added[CR]Some monsters translated[CR]ONE item translated-pathetic huh?[CR]Need[CR]a translator[CR]STUPID 16*16 font[CR]If anyone has info on the font please[CR]help!![CR]--------------------------[CR]V0.082[CR]Started status screen. 90%[CR]done.[CR]Having trouble w/some words...[CR]16*16 still needed to be[CR]changed.[CR]Need to start: Items, Spells, Weapons ect.[CR]REALLY COULD USE[CR]HELP!!!![CR]If you can help with anything mail[CR]me!(mumuchan24@aol.com)[CR]Homework bogging me down!(stupid honors[CR]classes...)[CR]--------------------------[CR]V0.08[CR]Startup screen[CR]100%[CR]Most menus english[CR]-cant find some sub-menus and battle menus[CR](if you can help e-mail me!)[CR]Bianca added[CR]Shop menu done[CR]still lots[CR]to do![CR]skipped to .08[CR]--------------------------[CR]V0.02a[CR]Startup[CR]screen english[CR]Menus english[CR]need help w/16*16[CR]will start battle[CR]menus[CR]--------------------------[CR]V0.02[CR]All 8*8 fonts[CR]debugged[CR]Working on 16*16[CR]need Hex equivilents for 8*8[CR]Still need[CR]help[CR]--------------------------[CR]V0.01b[CR]Found Bug that stopped[CR]game.[CR]Fixed all Upper case Letters(no bugs here)[CR]Working on lower(maybe[CR]here?)[CR]found some 16*16[CR]still no[CR]Hex[CR]--------------------------[CR]v0.01[CR]First patch[CR]8*8 font in[CR]english[CR]Cant find hex assignments[CR]cant find 16*16[CR]Need[CR]Help![CR]--------------------------[CR]If you can contribute ANY help please[CR]contact[CR]Muusu by e-mail[CR]MuMuChan24@aol.com[CR]Dont distribute with out[CR]my consent![CR]-To Apply the patch-[CR]extract Ucon, the Rom, and the IPS in[CR]the same directory.[CR]Open up a MS-Dos window and type:[CR]ucon i (Name of[CR]Rom) Dq5e.ips[CR]---------------------------[CR]1998 Zealsoft corp.</plot>

    <plot>With Dragon Quest VI, Enix took most of what was good about Dragon Quest V,[CR]and expanded upon it even more. With the exception of the multi-generation[CR]aspect, everything great about Dragon Quest V has returned here intact, and in[CR]some cases, improved. The game brings several firsts. For one, the game[CR]features a total of four different worlds to explore. Also, it's the first[CR]game in the series to feature monster animation, and better than average[CR]graphics. The game begins in a rather strange fashion, with you and your[CR]fellow party members being massacred by Mudo. As you can probably guess, this[CR]is not a good thing. But just when you think the game's over before it even[CR]begins, you wake up! The whole ordeal was just a dream. But still, it leaves[CR]you with many questions. Who were those other people who were fighting with[CR]you? And more importantly... who was that big tough-guy who kicked the crap[CR]out of your dreaming arse?! So you set out on a quest to find answers to those[CR]questions, and many more. Overall, it's an interesting and engrossing[CR]storyline. The menus are as simple and easy to use as ever - no real changes[CR]from the previous games here. Anyone with even the slightest experience with[CR]previous games in the series will have no trouble getting used to the[CR]controls. A welcome addition to the game is the return of the class system,[CR]last seen in Dragon Quest III. However, unlike Dragon Quest III, you can now[CR]freely switch your characters between classes, and work them up to new[CR]advanced-level jobs. Each class has special abilities and spells, to make each[CR]one useful in a different way. The first Dragon Quest that put effort into[CR]trying to impress visually. Not only are the overall graphics of a much higher[CR]quality than DQV's, but the game takes a chapter out of Sega's Phantasy Star[CR]series by implementing monster animations! Something almost every Dragon Quest[CR]game since, original or remix, has had. Overall, this is a pretty game. And as[CR]usual, composer Koichi Sugiyama never fails to impress. In fact, this may be[CR]one of his best works ever. A great emotional, and moodsetting soundtrack. You[CR]gotta hear the Orchestrated Soundtrack CD as well.

    <plot>This is one of the weirdest Super Famicom games I've ever had the chance of[CR]playing. And it's also pretty damn fun. There's not much of a story to start[CR]with, but it's enough to get you started. You play a generic hero (who's a[CR]kid) destined to dream the same thing over and over until you rescue the world[CR]of Enderia, which is governed by the evil demon Akumu. But the hero isn't[CR]alone. Along the way, he'll find companions which will hopefully help him out.[CR]The game is different from most console RPGs in two ways: First, you can find[CR]different "kigurumis", or costumes, when you beat your enemies - and when you[CR]wear it, your abilities will change for the better or worse. This is rather[CR]interesting because of the amount of enemies that there are in the game; you[CR]begin with a sparrow costume (which the hero does not like), but eventually[CR]you find other costumes which you can change in special dressing rooms spread[CR]across the mazes. Oh yeah, there's also tailor shops where you can modify,[CR]store or take out your suits, since you can only carry six at a time. And each[CR]suit may have a special ability as well. The other curious thing is the battle[CR]system. You basically have a typical turn-by-turn mode, but you attack using[CR]punches or kicks along a grid that surrounds your enemies. You can choose[CR]exactly where to hit them; this may prove to be useful to find weak spots.[CR]Also, certain enemies are weak to punches or kicks. The game will tell you if[CR]you did something right, which helps. The music is... well... it's catchy.[CR]There's some areas in the game that sound totally trippy, like something out[CR]of a Mexican late-1960's movie. Ever seen any of those badly dubbed lucha[CR]libre movies on MST3K or public access channels? Well, something like that.[CR]But even trippier.[CR]Read Me:[CR]Dream Maze - The Kigurumi[CR]Adventure[CR]v1.0 beta[CR]December 24, 2004[CR]KingMike Translations[CR](http://www.emuxhaven.net/~kingmike/index.html)[CR]***********[CR]INTROUCTION[CR]***********[CR]Dream[CR]Maze is a first-person RPG. Possibly the most bizzare first-person RPG[CR]released on the[CR]system. In this game, you play as the hero who is destined[CR]to relive one dream over and over[CR]again until he destorys the demon Akumu,[CR]who has enslaved the four princesses and the Queen of[CR]the world of Enderia.[CR]Also, the stuffed animals and toys of the world have become possessed.[CR]If[CR]our hero hopes to destroy Akumu, he will need to beat up the stuffed animals,[CR]and take the[CR]clothes, called Kigurumi, that are left behind. When putting[CR]on a new suit, at one of the[CR]Changing Rooms located throughout the land,[CR]his offensive and defensive abilities will change,[CR]hopefully for the[CR]better. With a strong enough costume, our hero, and his two allies, will[CR]be[CR]able to fight back and rescue the princesses and the Queen from the[CR]demon Akumu.[CR]****[CR]TEAM[CR]****[CR]KingMike[CR](http://kingmike.emuxhaven.net)[CR] - programming[CR]PLN[CR](http://silver.emuxhaven.net)[CR] - main translation[CR]The visitors of MOs[CR]board (http://donut.parodius.com/MO)[CR] - various translations[CR]Also a big[CR]thanks to the authors of the tools used:[CR] xkas, written by byuu[CR](http://setsuna.the2d.com)[CR] - priceless assistance with inserting ASM[CR]modifications[CR] SNES9X Tracer[CR] - adaptaion of SNES9X done by Evil Peer to[CR]allow tracing (finding and debugging assembly-[CR] level hacks)[CR] FEIDIAN[CR](http://feidian.sourceforge.net), written by Mr. D (http://d.the2d.com)[CR] -[CR]used for dumping/inserting the title logo[CR] Emulators used for early[CR]testing:[CR] - ZSNES (except one of WIPs that killed my SRAM[CR]:P)[CR]*********************[CR]PATCHING[CR]INSTRUCTIONS[CR]*********************[CR]The proper ROM is 1 megabyte, no[CR]header.

    <plot>Dual Orb 2 is a fairly generic RPG for the SNES. The graphics are good, the[CR]plot's alright, the music's good (although the inclusion of a boss battle[CR]theme would have been nice...), and the whole thing screams of "basically[CR]above average." You play as Aleth, heir-successor-person who was mysteriously[CR]found on a mountainside. You grow up being trained as a priest next to the[CR]crown prince Lagnus, and all is hunky-dory. You even go out and build a fort[CR]in the woods when you're a kid. Then, at one point, a visiting bard (who[CR]happens to be the only bard in any RPG I've played who can really kick some[CR]ass in battle) needs to get to the neighboring country, so you and Lagnus tail[CR]along. You naturally do your damnedest to get in trouble and break a seal and[CR]wake up your third real party member, and when you get back home, the place[CR]has been ransacked by the stereotypical Evil Invading Empire, and stuff[CR]happens and things. Yep. Again, nothing groundbreaking, but it works. The[CR]interesting thing about the game is that there are very few real weapons that[CR]you can buy, maybe only ten or fifteen varieties total. Rather, you can spend[CR]your money upgrading your weaponry. Each time you upgrade it, it gets stronger[CR](naturally) and once you upgrade it past a certain point, it becomes an[CR]uberweapon and you can use a special sekrit technique if you're low on health.[CR]You wander around in dungeons and on the overworld, like in standard RPGs, and[CR]this is where one of my minor gripes comes in. The overworld is done in a[CR]tilted Mode-7 style, like FF3/6's overworld, but quite simply, it's too[CR]zoomed-in. The world is kind of small, but when you're trying to explore the[CR]massive southern continent with the desert on it, the zoomed-in view, combined[CR]with the encounter rate, actually started to get me kinda lost. Speaking of[CR]the encounter rate, I might as well mention right here and now that it's high.[CR]Very high. Some might consider it to be ridiculously high. Battles go by[CR]quickly so it wasn't much of a big deal for me, but it might be for some[CR]people. Another thing I should probably mention in this paragraph, while I'm[CR]dealing with the combat system, is the difficult level. Some people consider[CR]this to be one of the hardest SNES RPGs ever, but I can't say I had a very[CR]difficult time of it... The fact of the matter is that stat-boosting spells[CR]and items are cumulative and last for the duration of the battle (or your[CR]character's health bar) so you can just pump your party up until the enemies[CR]aren't doing squat for damage against you and then just slaughter them. The[CR]high encounter rate and general above-average difficulty of the normal random[CR]battles was nice, though. I found myself actually having to level up. Not for[CR]extremely excessive amounts of time - the game is only 20 or 30 someodd hours[CR]long - but it was definitely necessary. The prospect of a bit of a challenge[CR]was fun for a change. I freely admit to not having beaten many fan-translated[CR]games (aside from the ones I've worked on, heh...) I can probably count them[CR]all on one hand. Suffice to say, I beat Dual Orb 2, and I was very satisfied[CR]with it.

[CR]2.0[CR]Introduction and words about the project[CR] Finally! At long last, I give to[CR]you Dual Orb 2 in full English glory! [CR] Its been a long year and a half. I[CR]know there are other projects out [CR] there that have taken longer, but I[CR]have worked almost entirely, and [CR] exclusively on Dual Orb 2 for the full[CR]year and a half. I never really [CR] took any extended breaks either! Alot of[CR]work has gone into this [CR] project. I have been a one man team aside from[CR]Akujin. [CR] [CR] When Akujin came on board, he translated the entire script,[CR] retranslating what was already done and continuing right to the end. I[CR] think he did a wonderful job, and with a final edit done by himself and[CR] David Mullen, the story came out very well written and very enjoyable![CR] It was a pleasure working with Akujin, and I think youll be very happy[CR] with his work. [CR] [CR] I think this project was one of fairly high[CR]magnitude. With 343 text [CR] blocks, multiple methods of evil compression,[CR]and all around general [CR] evilness, it was definitely a challenging feat to[CR]hack/translate. Others [CR] tried and failed, but this time we were[CR]successful! I say we because [CR] it was a team effort. The romhacking[CR]community for the most part is a [CR] team. I couldnt have done it without the[CR]help and support from my [CR] fellow hackers! =) Because of that, I give this[CR]translation to the scene [CR] as my contribution, for all the hard work they[CR]have done for many of the [CR] translated wonders we can now play because of[CR]them. And for the respect, [CR] friendliness and help that many of those[CR]individuals have shown me. I [CR] also give this translation to the public,[CR]for their support in hopes [CR] that they will give this little gem of a game[CR]a chance, and so they may [CR] enjoy a game that would otherwise not been[CR]accessible for them to play. [CR] I believe this quality of this project has[CR]turned out to be amongst the [CR] best of fan translations. It may not be a[CR]Square game, or Tales of [CR] Phantasia, or Star Ocean, but it is a good game[CR]in its own regards and [CR] has received what I believe to be a quality[CR]translation approaching that [CR] of the aforementioned games. So, without[CR]further delay, I present to you [CR] Dual Orb 2 in English brought to you by[CR]Nightcrawlers Translation [CR] Corporation! Enjoy! [CR] [CR]3.0 About the[CR]Game[CR] I think this is a very good RPG. It is rather linear, but it has[CR]great [CR] music, pretty nice looking graphics, and a very nice story. The[CR] characters are light-hearted and it simply a fun game to play! It has a[CR] very rare weapon system for RPGs. The weapons are upgradeable and have[CR] 19 levels. You can upgrade them in the blacksmith, or find them in [CR]treasure chests. Sometimes you can even get a cursed weapon at level -1! [CR]The game is HARD! When I say hard, I mean HARD! You will be begging for [CR]mercy from the bosses later in the game. The first half isnt that bad, [CR]its the second half thatll get ya. If your sick and tired of todays [CR]cheesy easy RPGs, this game is for you! Youll definitely get a [CR]challenging experience. Im definitely excited to be able to share my [CR] work[CR]with the rest of you and give you a chance to play something you [CR]otherwise wouldnt be able to! The patch is 100% and fully translated, [CR] but[CR]does have a few glitches mentioned in this readme! [CR] So enjoy the patch!![CR]If you have any questions, comments, concerns or [CR] anything to say at all,[CR]feel free to post on my message board. If you [CR] get stuck in the game, the[CR]message board is the best place to go for [CR] help! You can find it all at:[CR] [CR] http://transcorp.romhacking.net[CR] [CR] Oh yeah, hey feel free to[CR]send me some supportive e-mails! Its tough to [CR] work on projects when you[CR]feel unappreciated sometimes. Appreciation [CR] gives us Rom hackers[CR]inspiration to continue! [CR]4.0 Credits[CR] These are pretty short being Ive[CR]been basically a one man team! haha[CR] Project Coordinator: Nightcrawler[CR]ROM hacker: Nightcrawler[CR] Translator: Akujin[CR] Script Editing:[CR]Akujin/David Mullen [CR]5.0 What you will find in this patch:[CR] Its complete[CR]now, so you SHOULD find everything 100% translated![CR] There are a few known[CR]issues though, mentioned below. [CR] You will also find myself, Nightcrawler,[CR]hidden in the game somewhere. [CR] I didnt change the sprites, so I am[CR]identifiable by text only. :) I [CR] will speak some humorous dialogue having[CR]to do with my wife in the [CR] game, also in that location. I am married in[CR]real life for anyone [CR] wondering :) I have a wife whom has been very[CR]understanding over the [CR] past year and a half competing with Dual Orb 2 for[CR]my time! haha =) [CR] Sorry, there really arent any other Easter eggs that I[CR]have put in the [CR] patch. I think the game speaks for itself and doesnt need[CR]any [CR] additions. [CR]6.0 Known Issues:[CR] [CR]6.1 Original Game Bugs:[CR]1. Kardosa Castle, Empty Windows after Sindra fight - After defeating [CR]Sindra, you may try to talk to the lift control panel or ledge by the [CR]lava. The original game crashes here. The patch does not, but text [CR]windows are blank instead. [CR]6.2 Known Patch Issues:[CR] None![CR]6.3 Non-[CR]Issues to Note:[CR] 1. Treasure Chest Weapons - Say you open a treasure chest[CR]and it says [CR] you got a Spear. It doesnt specify what level Spear it is.[CR]Its NOT [CR] supposed to. When you go to equip it, it will say Atk: ?. Its a[CR]mystery [CR] UNTIL you equip it and its identity is revealed! (Watch out for[CR]cursed [CR] weapons) [CR]7.0 Special Thanks[CR] Special Thanks go out to these[CR]people for contribution and help in this [CR] project. Without you guys, this[CR]patch may not have been possible!

    <plot>Emerald Dragon is an RPG about a dragon who has raised a human child in the[CR]dragon world. After the child is grown and leaves for the human world all hell[CR]breaks loose and you too must follow. Your character IS a dragon but mostly[CR]stays in human form because the human world is not suitable for his kind. The[CR]battles are random encounters but unlike many similar SNES games they have a[CR]top-down perspective and each character has so much "energy" that they can use[CR]per turn. This energy can be used for moving toward enemies, attacking, etc.[CR]It's also one of the few SNES games to feature a good number of real voice[CR]samples for when the characters get hurt, cast spells, etc.[CR]Read[CR]Me:[CR] _______________ ________ [CR] / _____ _____ \ / ______ \ [CR]/ / | | \[CR]\ Nightcrawlers / / \ \\[CR]\/ | | \/ / / \ \\[CR] | | / / ____\/ /\\___[CR]/\\_____[CR] | | /\\___ ___/\ /\\___ /\ | | //--\\\ |/--\\\ |/----\\\\[CR] | |[CR]|/--\\\ //--|| ||--\\\ / / | | || || || ` || || [CR] | | || ` || || || || / /[CR]| | ||__|| || ||____|| [CR] | | || ||__|| || || \ \ | | \\____/ ||[CR]||_____/[CR] | | || \\___|| || || \ \ \ \ /\\\/ || [CR] | | \/ \/ \/ \/ / / \[CR]\ / / ||[CR] | | \/ \ \\______/ / || [CR] \ / (c)2014 All rights reserved.[CR]\\________/ \/[CR] `[CR]***********************************************************************[CR]Emerald Dragon(c)[CR] English Translation Patch[CR] presented by:[CR]Nightcrawlers[CR] Translation Corporation[CR]http://transcorp.romhacking.net[CR] Version 1.2 October 30th[CR]2014[CR]***********************************************************************[CR]Table[CR]of Contents[CR]1.0 Information[CR] 1.1 Patch Information[CR] 1.2 Distribution[CR]and Licensing Information[CR] 1.3 Copyright Information[CR] 1.4[CR]Disclaimer[CR]2.0 The Project[CR] 2.1 History of the Project[CR] 2.2 The[CR]Team[CR]3.0 About the Game[CR]4.0 Credits of who worked on this Patch[CR]5.0[CR]What you will find in the Patch[CR]6.0 Known Issues in the Patch[CR]7.0[CR]Special Thanks[CR]1.0 Information[CR]1.1 ****Patch Information****[CR] This[CR]patch when hard patched correctly will result in a VALID checksum.[CR] This[CR]patch was created for use on an original ROM that has:[CR] * NO header[CR] *[CR]CRC32: 0x9D0F5F98[CR] * NSRT (http://www.romhacking.net/utilities/400/)[CR]identified as[CR] Emerald Dragon, Version 1.0, 0x7797 Checksum[CR] The[CR]TransPatch.exe custom patching application can be used to ensure [CR] you have[CR]the correct ROM and patch, and apply the patch to headered or [CR] non-[CR]headered ROMs automatically.

[CR]2.0 Project[CR]History and Words about the Team[CR]2.1 Project History[CR] The Emerald Dragon[CR]project has an over 5 year long storied history. [CR] When I started work on[CR]this project, it wasnt even mine. Back around [CR] May of 2002, D-boy was[CR]asking for help on the hacking of Emerald Dragon, [CR] specifically, the text[CR]compression. I started working on this for him [CR] during some off time I had[CR]from Dual Orb 2. That was supposed to be all [CR] I was going to do on the[CR]project. At the time, I had no intentions of [CR] doing anything else with[CR]Emerald Dragon. For reasons I dont have record [CR] of right now, at some[CR]point after that D-boy quit wanting to be involved [CR] in any of the hacking[CR]work on Emerald Dragon. Maybe I took too long, [CR] maybe it was his opinion[CR]of the SNES port, or just wanting to quit [CR] hacking. I dont recall at this[CR]point. [CR] In August 2002, Emerald Dragon was announced as an official[CR]project of [CR] TransCorp. I had figured out the compression and started[CR]coding a script [CR] dumper. D-boy was also at the helm as the translator for[CR]the project. I [CR] believe it was Ds Emerald Dragon page (which can still be[CR]viewed at [CR] http://emedra.lakuuna.org/) that got me interested enough in[CR]Emerald [CR] Dragon to pick it up as a project of my own. That and the fact[CR]that I [CR] had already invested a good amount of time in it. Progress[CR]remained [CR] steady on Emerald Dragon until February 2003. [CR] [CR] In[CR]February 2003, D-boy quit over what I believe was a single passing [CR] post[CR]on the message board to an inquiring fan where I mentioned merely [CR] the[CR]possibility of shortening or changing Saoshyants name. Without a [CR]translator, progress was slow on Emerald Dragon through most of 2003. A [CR]few technical difficulties came up with the text storage and trying to [CR]get a full dump along with obstacles in the menu work. Emerald Dragon [CR] was[CR]definitely a tough game to handle with many technical obstacles, [CR]seemingly having many remnants of the 8-bit computer architecture [CR]previous ports used. In many cases, it seemed artificial limits were [CR]imposed that were not necessary for the SNES. [CR] [CR] In February of 2004,[CR]some collaboration with David Shadoff whom was [CR] working on the PCE-CD[CR]port, sparked some new motivation to pull the [CR] project off the backburner.[CR]The PCE-CD version shared several technical [CR] similarities and exchanged[CR]some control code information. 2004 saw a lot [CR] of progress in Emerald[CR]Dragon hacking wise. The entire script was [CR] re-dumped, a new set of hacks[CR]were put in place for the menus to overcome [CR] space limitations, a 2-line[CR]item hack was completed and more. By [CR] December of 2004, a patch was[CR]released translating with most all of the [CR] non dialog work completed.[CR]However, there was still no translator for [CR] the main script. [CR] [CR] In[CR]2005, a few translators attempted to pick up Emerald Dragon and [CR]disappeared, quit, or didnt have time. That seems to always happen on [CR]these projects. Sometime around April 2005, Eien Ni Hen signed up to [CR]translate the script. She retranslated all parts that were done already [CR]and got to work on the rest of the script. Thankfully, Eien proved to be[CR]much more reliable than past translators. [CR] [CR] 2006 was a rather dark[CR]year for Emerald Dragon as much of my time was [CR] spent bringing the Wozz[CR]project to a close. Eien finished the tentative [CR] final version of the[CR]script though in early 2006. Unfortunately, there [CR] wasnt enough man power[CR]to work on and complete both projects at the [CR] same time. [CR] [CR] In[CR]2007, after being burnt out from Wozz, I took a good deal of time off [CR]from ROM hacking and was instead working on the ROMhacking.net site. It [CR]wasnt until July 2007, the 10th anniversary of TransCorp that I really [CR]got motivated again to finish Emerald Dragon up. In only a few months [CR]time, I reorganized and reworked all past hacking work on the project, [CR]coded an inserter for the game, inserted the entire script, and had the [CR]project ready for beta by the end of October. [CR] [CR] Weve spent the rest of[CR]the time between then and now fixing the game [CR] and script up to be the[CR]best we know how for a public release. Its [CR] always a proud moment when a[CR]lengthy multi-year project gets finished, [CR] but I am truly proud of the[CR]Emerald Dragon Project itself. Im happy [CR] with the script Eien put out in[CR]the end, and I am happy with the hacking [CR] work. I didnt have to make many[CR]compromises to my own ideals on it and [CR] got to do most of what I wanted to[CR]do. [CR] I really hope youll enjoy several more years worth of my passion for[CR] and dedication to this hobby and community. I freely and proudly give[CR] you the opportunity to play Emerald Dragon in English. Thank you to all[CR] who have given me words of support, all who have given a helping hand to[CR] the project, and the fans of TransCorp and our community. Take it, love[CR] it, cherish it! [CR] [CR]2.1 The Team (Aside from Nightcrawler)[CR] Eien[CR]Ni Hen:[CR] Eien proved to be a more reliable translator then any I have[CR]previously [CR] worked with. Communication was good, and she worked as[CR]diligently as [CR] could be expected on a hobby/volunteer based project. Those[CR]of us in our [CR] adult lives can really appreciate efforts like this knowing[CR]how [CR] difficult it can be. Thanks goes to Eien for being patient waiting[CR]for [CR] me to finish up the hacking long after she completed the script. I[CR]hope [CR] the experience was as good for her in return. [CR] Beta Testers:[CR]After having such a successful beta testing team for Wozz, I thought Id [CR]try to reassemble most of the team and make some magic all over again. I [CR]would like to thank the beta testing team of Eien Ni Hen, Princess, King [CR]Mike, and Misty for finding and filing over 200 issues into the bug [CR]tracker! Id also like to thank Trunkz0r and Liana for their partial [CR]testing assistance. Emerald Dragon was demanding on beta testers to find [CR]instances where text did not fit in the window as every text box in the [CR]game had its own independent size stored separately from the dialog. [CR]While an automated in game approach was created, it could not cover all [CR]possible cases. [CR]3.0 About the Game[CR] Emerald Dragon is a fun little[CR]refreshing game all around. On the [CR] surface it looks like your average[CR]16-bit SNES RPG, and in some respect [CR] it is, but dig a little deeper and[CR]youll discover the gold. The charm [CR] in this game is the character[CR]development. The games plot is driven by [CR] character development and[CR]interaction rather than the typical story [CR] telling fashion of most RPGs.[CR]There are 11 characters that will come in [CR] and out of your party[CR]throughout the game. Some will be more developed [CR] than others, but the[CR]core party members get well developed and you [CR] actually care what happens[CR]to them at the end of the game. This was a [CR] big selling point for me on[CR]this game. [CR] [CR] The main plot spins around a relationship and promise[CR]between a human [CR] named Tamryn, and a dragon named Atrushan. Theres also a[CR]second primary [CR] relationship that develops throughout the game. I wont[CR]spoil the plot [CR] much, but in addition to that, youve got the typical RPG[CR]fare of [CR] fighting the Demon Army, villagers with attitudes, ancient Dragon[CR]Gods, [CR] and treasures to be found. The game does not shy away from dealing[CR]with [CR] death, war, oppression and some other dark issues. [CR] [CR] The[CR]battle system blends your typical turn based RPG with Ys series like [CR]ramming enemies! Its pretty simple, but adds a little bit of strategy [CR]with your stamina points for each turn and items and what not. Only [CR]Atrushan is actually playable. Only controlling one character in battle [CR]turned out to be more fun than I thought. The computer AI was adequate [CR]and I didnt find myself yelling at them out loud often! Atrushan and [CR]Tamryn are the only characters that level up, and it was interesting to [CR]see Tamryn progress her skills under AI control. The encounter rate is [CR]somewhat high, but the battles are typically fast paced and easy enough [CR]to be fun. [CR] [CR] Emerald Dragon is an RPG that has spanned ports across[CR]several systems. [CR] It has been on the PC88/98, MSX, x68000, PCE-CDROM(Turbo[CR]Duo),FM-towns, [CR] and the SNES! There must have been something about this[CR]game to warrant [CR] so many ports. Those of you whom have read Ds Emerald[CR]Dragon page will [CR] certainly have read his opinion on what he believes to[CR]be an inferior [CR] port. While some points are true, there are definitely[CR]some inaccuracies [CR] there (the musical changes off hand for one) as well as[CR]some arguably [CR] just and unjust attacks. I have also played the FM Towns[CR]version and the [CR] PCE-CD version myself and there are certainly things I[CR]prefer in the [CR] SNES port and things I prefer from the others. The SNES[CR]port certainly [CR] has its pluses and minuses and contains many changes (as[CR]do the other [CR] ports), but it is currently the only version with an English[CR]translation [CR] at present time. [CR] [CR] I found it to be a fun game to[CR]play and I hope you will too.[CR] [CR]4.0 Credits[CR] Here are the people that[CR]helped make this translation possible.

Due to the dynamic nature [CR] of the game[CR]engine, I was unable to consistently reproduce the issue to [CR] fix it as[CR]each time you load the menu, things are loading in different [CR] RAM and VRAM[CR]locations. Honestly, I got too frustrated to fix it under [CR] those[CR]conditions. It should be unnecessary to use this command anyway as [CR] you[CR]dont need to manually remove equipment as equipping new equipment [CR] does[CR]this automatically. Gameplay should be unaffected.

I was[CR]pretty green to SNES hacking, although I was familiar[CR]with 6502, the precursor[CR]to the 65816 in the SNES, from my childhood[CR]computer, the BBC Micro 32k, manufactured[CR]by Acorn.[CR]Romancing Saga 3 was[CR]proving to be a hell of a lot harder than I had expected, due[CR]to the[CR]copious amounts of complex subcode mixed in with the text. I had also[CR]just[CR]found out that DeJap were close to finishing Tales of Phantasia,[CR]rendering my work[CR]on that game fairly pointless. It was around that time[CR]that I heard that a game[CR]called Energy Breaker had just been dumped so I[CR]checked it out.[CR]Playing through the first few scenes in Eltois, I thought[CR]the game looked and[CR]sounded absolutely beautiful. I need a new high-profle[CR]project, since things werent[CR]going so well with the other projects I[CR]decided to have a crack at Energy Breaker. I[CR]was glad to leave the subcode[CR]madness of RS3 behind...[CR]Early work progressed quite quickly. Menus and 8x8[CR]were quickly dumped and[CR]Avicalendriya agreed to do translation work.[CR]Assembler work was also pretty quick[CR]back then, I managed to get some[CR]pretty buggy VWF hacks in on the menu and dual-line[CR]the "chat" menu, though[CR]keeping the fixed-width font.[CR]I also got a VWF in on the dialogue windows[CR]and then looked into dumping the script.[CR]There was a reasonably simple LZ[CR]compression scheme, with which I was quite familiar[CR]from ToP... and then[CR]the actual dialogue dump started. Quite a few strange[CR]opcodes mixed in the[CR]dialogue...[CR]Subcode...[CR]Crap...[CR]I had invested so much time in the[CR]hack by then that I decided to just go with it[CR]and proceeded, for the best[CR]part of a year (my final year of high-school) to document[CR]all the subcode[CR]so that it could be decompiled and recompiled with the dialogue.[CR]Avi[CR]persuaded me to split the dialogue text from the surrounding control[CR]code and so the[CR]inserter was born. Sadly I lost my reference to the subcode[CR]somewhere along the way[CR]so there will never be an EB editor.[CR]It was[CR]around this time that real-life hit Avi and so I was out of a translator.[CR]I[CR]started to look at the other text hacks I would have to do. It slowly[CR]became apparent[CR]that Energy Breaker was probably the most complicated game[CR]to hack that I could have[CR]ever chosen. Every little thing had its own text[CR]routine: Names next to characters,[CR]notification text, the chat menu, battle[CR]text, world map text... Everything needed[CR]re-coding and my "easier than[CR]RS3" project was definitely anything but.[CR]I decided I needed a better[CR]workflow and started dumping entire routines, rationalizing[CR]them and THEN[CR]doing the actual hacking work. The first example of this was for[CR]the[CR]character name entry menu, which took a month of the summer after school[CR]to[CR]disassemble and recode. I was pretty careful to avoid the mistakes that[CR]had[CR]plagued the project, like doing small assembler hacks directly with a[CR]hex editor[CR](I didnt have an assembler for ToP, so I worked with a 65816[CR]reference and an editor.[CR]I therefore ended up learning all the hex codes[CR]for the 65816 instructions and can[CR]still program a reasonable routine[CR]directly with a hex editor, though this results[CR]in buggy kludge-code). I[CR]would still say the "ring menu" hack is one of the cleanest[CR]replacement[CR]routines Ive coded and the ASM hack in EB that Im proudest of. The[CR]sheer[CR]number of other routines was really daunting and I was alone at this[CR]point, so work[CR]was pretty slow.[CR]There wasnt much interest in the project[CR]from translators until Shivalva came on board[CR]and started to do some[CR]dialogue work. It was great to finally see some dialogue in the[CR]game but it[CR]showed up quite a lot of bugs so work on anything but dialogue stalled[CR]for[CR]a long time. Im not quite sure what happened to Shivalva but after doing a[CR]small[CR]portion of the script, we kinda lost contact. I think he became[CR]demotivated by how slowly[CR]work was going on the hacking side of things,[CR]since I was grappling with about 10[CR]different text routines.[CR]After a[CR]while, I released a "teaser" patch with the buggy work to date, to try and[CR]attract[CR]attention. Filler and satsu responded and work resumed.[CR]Coordinating two translators[CR]proved to be difficult and satsu started[CR]complaining that the process of sending[CR]me the script for every revision[CR]was slow and tedious. I agreed and started to put[CR]together a maketool: A[CR]single program that would assemble all the code and text and put[CR]them all[CR]into the expanded area of the ROM. With two clicks, the entire ROM[CR]could be[CR]updated at once! Bearing in mind that I started in a romhacking era when[CR]using[CR]Thingy to hack text in-situ was pretty normal, I think this is a[CR]reasonable achievment.[CR]satsu quickly took over as sole translator and[CR]persuaded me to make a few changes to the[CR]inserter, like moving all the[CR]dialogue into one file. Although the new code that I was[CR]writing was quite[CR]decent, there was still a lot of legacy left in the ROM and the new[CR]was[CR]built on the old. To this date, I still dont know exactly how many old[CR]hacks are in the[CR]ROM, absolutely essential but equally[CR]mysterious...[CR]Progress continued in spurts from 2004 through to 2006: I did[CR]some hacking, left it for a[CR]while, satsu did some translating, got[CR]distracted by Filena. During this time, I ended up[CR]meeting satsu IRL, since[CR]he was studying pretty close to me. We still meet up once or twice[CR]a year,[CR]to get ruinously drunk, to this day. Around 2006, two things happened:[CR]Firstly, we[CR]decided that it was time to do beta testing, and got RadicalR,[CR]Sheex, Gideon Zhi and ballz on[CR]board, and secondly I moved to Switzerland[CR]to begin my PhD. I carried on the bug-fixing for[CR]a few months before[CR]getting completely crushed by the work-load in my new position;[CR]Hacking[CR]work basically ceased, although I would still meet with satsu and[CR]he would complain at me.[CR]Finally in the middle of August 2012. satsu[CR]decided enough was enough and he was[CR]going to do a final release, bugs and[CR]all but perhaps there were "a couple" of small hacks[CR]I could do that would[CR]take no time. I did these small hacks and my sense of perfectionism[CR]drove[CR]me to do a few more. Before I knew it, I was back in the saddle and started[CR]smashing[CR]bugs left, right and centre. We decided on a release-date of[CR]September 1st and this[CR]definite deadline moved me to get everything ready[CR]to a profesional standard, hack-wise.[CR]Quite a few minor bugs were found in[CR]the days leading up to release and these too were[CR]crushed by the power of[CR]assembler hacking.[CR]Disnesquick - Retrospective[CR]Energy Breaker is[CR]probably the longest running ROM hack there is. The reason for[CR]this is that[CR]it is probably the hardest ROM hack in history. The menus in Energy[CR]Breaker[CR]are incredibly dynamic and every tiny piece of text gets its own routine.[CR]I[CR]have come to loathe the programmers for this and its pretty clear that[CR]the[CR]game was a rush job.[CR]Coming up to release, I spent about a month[CR]past my announced release date, "fixing[CR]up the menus" to remove "a bit of[CR]flicker". This turned into a complete reprogramming[CR]of the menus because[CR]the original code was so godawful. The menus are now cleaner and[CR]faster[CR]than they were in the original game![CR]Looking back on Energy Breaker there[CR]is a lot I could have done differently, to get a[CR]faster release but I was a[CR]kid when I began work: I started the project when I was 17[CR]and will be 30[CR]in under a year.[CR]It would not be an exageration to say that this[CR]translation is my lifes work. Wherever[CR]I went, the files went with me and[CR]Ive always been paranoid about losing them, knowing[CR]"some day" I would[CR]finish the project off. That day has now come: I feel happy and[CR]regret[CR]nothing. For those who have waited, thanks for your patience, if I[CR]ever do another hack[CR]then it wont take as long. Romancing Saga 3 would be a[CR]god damn walk in the park[CR]compared to this monster...[CR]I am incredibly[CR]glad to have worked on this game, and to have met a number of[CR]friends[CR]through it, most obviously satsu. Thanks to everyone who lent their[CR]support during[CR]its difficult birth![CR]Translators Notes -[CR]Retrospective[CR] Its hard to believe that the time to write this has finally[CR]come. Ive[CR]been working on this project for about eight years now, so its[CR]hard to[CR]imagine that its finally being released; or better said, its hard[CR]to believe[CR] that Im finally letting go of it.[CR] What kind of reception[CR]will this translation get? What kind of reception[CR]will Energy Breaker get[CR]in the English-speaking world? I can only hope that at[CR]least someone out[CR]there will come to have as fond memories of the game as I do[CR]now, having[CR]gone through every nook and cranny of it.[CR] On a personal level, this[CR]translation is very important to me. I started[CR]working on it as a[CR]university student, and continued to work on it through my[CR]career as a[CR]professional translator to date. I learnt a great deal about the[CR]art of[CR]translating games over that time, and gained a great deal of[CR]valuable[CR]experience. I would always pass on the knowledge Id acquired to[CR]the Energy[CR]Breaker project in one way or another. There are several strata[CR]of translation[CR]here: namely my work as a student with a few gaps in my[CR]Japanese abilities, as[CR]a fresh-faced graduate, as translator whod finally[CR]broken into professional[CR]work and finally, as a localisation veteran. No[CR]wonder it took so much editing.[CR] Disnesquick mentioned in his retrospective[CR]that others had participated in[CR]the translation, but despite that, I still[CR]find it a very personal work. There[CR]is actually very little of the[CR]translations provided by others left: most of[CR]it was unusable due to the[CR]difficulties in translating the script, and I [CR]retranslated or heavily[CR]rewrote nearly everything. I hope that this shows in[CR]the final product -[CR]that the script feels like a cohesive, polished and[CR]consistent work rather[CR]than a patchwork of translation.[CR] I mentioned the difficulty of translating[CR]the script. I suppose these[CR]notes are still "translators notes", so I[CR]should probably write about what[CR]kind of grief this project gave me. Let me[CR]quickly list up a few reasons why[CR]translating the script was a rather[CR]difficult task:[CR] 1.) It takes a long time to get used to the way the script[CR]is written, if[CR]you look at it purely from a textual angle. The script is[CR]sorted into blocks[CR]for each location, then into events, conversations and[CR]search text. Rarely was[CR]it in chronological order. To make things worse,[CR]there is loads of unused text.[CR]A lot of it is developer text, like dummy[CR]text for characters or conversations,[CR]events or places that were removed,[CR]or goofy debug comments about a staff[CR]members pubes. No, really.[CR] 2.)[CR]Almost all the dialogue is given in speech bubbles. The style of[CR]writing is[CR]extremely conversational, and as a result, elements like the page[CR]breaks[CR]and flow of conversation are based on how people talk in Japanese. It[CR]was a[CR]considerable effort trying to get the speech bubbles to work for[CR]English,[CR]and took a great deal of editing and rewriting. Though we could[CR]cut down on[CR]some speech bubbles or add them in places, there were places[CR]where we had to[CR]obey what was provided for the Japanese script, such as[CR]heavily scripted[CR]scenes with lots of character actions.[CR] 3.) You had to[CR]work out who was talking based on the way the lines were[CR]written, which[CR]proved very difficult at times as many lines were very short or[CR]were[CR]written in a way that didnt provide much in the way of clues.[CR] 4.) Because[CR]generic responses to Myras attitude or responses to keywords[CR]were mixed in[CR]with all the other text in NPC conversations, it was very[CR]difficult to work[CR]out what was what at first.[CR] 5.) At times, the story is just plain[CR]confusing or poorly explained, and[CR]there are some parts that are obviously[CR]rushed. This made it hard to translate,[CR]and even harder to edit in order to[CR]improve this for the English version.[CR] I hope that with the above in mind,[CR]the other translators understand why I[CR]retranslated and rewrote so much of[CR]the text that I feel like I can[CR]confidently call this my translation. It[CR]was a very rewarding challenge, and I[CR]hope that the script that Ive[CR]delivered in the end is good enough for me to[CR]go around talking about it at[CR]great length like this.[CR] This may be one of my last big fan translations,[CR]and certainly one of the[CR]last big SNES translations. I certainly dont think[CR]Ill ever get to work on a[CR]project that means so much to me and that has so[CR]much personal history bound[CR]up in it ever again.[CR] -[CR]satsu[CR]==============================================================================[CR]5.[CR]GETTING[CR]STARTED[CR]==============================================================================[CR]Energy[CR]Breaker has two main gameplay modes: the field, where you can freely[CR]wander[CR]around and talk to characters, and battle, where you are constrained[CR]by[CR]certain rules and cant interact with the environment.[CR]For a list of[CR]controls, you can refer to the Controls option on the settings[CR]menu,[CR]accessible by pressing START. Some on-screen prompts are also given[CR]on[CR]menus.[CR]= Basic Controls: Field =[CR]D-Pad: Move Myra[CR]A Button:[CR]Talk/examine[CR]B Button: Jump up or down a level[CR]X Button: Open menu[CR]Y[CR]Button: --[CR]L/R Buttons: Change direction Myra is facing[CR]= Basic[CR]Controls: Battle =[CR]D-Pad: Move cursor/navigate menus[CR]A Button: Confirm[CR]selection[CR]B Button: Cancel[CR]X Button: Open menu[CR]Y Button: --[CR]L/R[CR]Buttons: Change direction character is facing[CR]= Balance =[CR]During battle,[CR]every action you take costs Balance points, or "Bal". When you[CR]select a[CR]skill from the list, youll see the amount of Bal points required to[CR]use[CR]that move. Moving your character will cost 5 Bal. Bal is also required[CR]to[CR]use items in your inventory. You can use items like Robalran Powder to[CR]restore[CR]your Bal, or allow it to recover automatically at the start of a[CR]new turn.[CR]However, please note that you will recover Bal more slowly if[CR]youve taken[CR]damage.[CR]= Skills and Energy =[CR]In order to use skills,[CR]youll need to channel the right amounts of energy for[CR]each element: wind[CR](green), water (blue), fire (red) and earth (yellow).[CR]The amount of energy[CR]you have for each element will be given in values like[CR]"2/3" or "0/3". The[CR]first number is the amount of energy you have assigned to[CR]that element,[CR]while the second number is the maximum possible amount. You can[CR]increase[CR]the latter value by levelling up or using certain items. The former,[CR]you[CR]can freely adjust depending on how many Pp points your character has.[CR]For[CR]example, if you have 5 Pp, you can distribute 5 points across the[CR]elements.[CR]Incidentally, your energy balance subtly affects your[CR]stats.[CR]Over the course of your adventure, youll pick up items called[CR]Grimoires that[CR]show you the balance of elements youll need to learn and use[CR]skills. Once[CR]youve assigned the right balance of elements, youll[CR]automatically learn the[CR]skill during the course of battle. (Note, however,[CR]that one character learns[CR]skills by defeating certain enemies, rather than[CR]from Grimoires.)[CR]= General Advice =[CR]- Dont forget to buy a weapon.[CR]-[CR]Check EVERYTHING. Items are hiding practically everywhere.[CR]- Really, check[CR]everything. The game rewards this.[CR]- Once youve cleared a stage (battle),[CR]the Run option will become available[CR] the next time you play that[CR]stage.[CR]- If you make the moral decision to CHEAT, please be aware that[CR]battle-related[CR]cheats like infinite Bal will cause the game to crash during[CR]scenes outside of[CR]battle.[CR]- Naturally-occurring items like Roelby[CR]Berries and Robalran Powder dont run[CR]out, so you can keep picking them up.[CR]However, you cant pick them up if you[CR]already have one in your[CR]inventory.[CR]==============================================================================[CR]6.[CR]KNOWN[CR]ISSUES[CR]==============================================================================[CR]-[CR]The Bin Bug[CR]For some reason, your Bin (where all the items you throw away[CR]go) can get[CR]filled with random items. This can affect the balance of the[CR]game, because[CR]you can sell your Bins contents, and make quite a lot of[CR]money in the[CR]process.[CR]==============================================================================[CR]7.[CR]PATCHING[CR]INFORMATION[CR]==============================================================================[CR]This[CR]patch is designed for use on an unheadered ROM. If you dont know how[CR]to[CR]check whether your ROM has a header or not, you can check using a[CR]utility like[CR]TUSH, available at[CR][http://www.romhacking.net/utilities/608/].[CR]= When Using Emulators[CR]=[CR]Most modern emulators feature the ability to automatically, temporarily[CR]patch[CR]the ROM for you, so you shouldnt have to manually patch it[CR]yourself.[CR]For more information on automatically patching the ROM, check the[CR]readme for[CR]the emulator youre using.[CR]= When Using Copiers =[CR]Youll[CR]need to hard patch the ROM.

    <plot>This is a very Final Fantasy V type of game. The artistic style is almost[CR]exactly the same, and it even has its own crappy version of an Active Time[CR]Battle system. That being said, it's based on an anime or something, and it[CR]involves a girl who pretends to be a guy, I'm not sure why though.[CR]Okay.[CR]Read Me:[CR]Eternal Filena English translation patch[CR]v0.98[CR]Contents[CR]================================================================================[CR]1.[CR]Patch History[CR]2.

Patch[CR]History[CR]================================================================================[CR]v0.98[CR]- 02/02/2009[CR]- All dialogue text should be 100% fully translated.[CR]- I[CR]forgot the title screen in the last patch. Its in now.[CR]- All that remains[CR]to be done is to sort out the very last of the 8x8[CR]issues and replace the[CR]8x8 font with something that matches the dialogue[CR]font a bit better. --&gt;[CR]v0.99[CR]- Also, a final beta test. --&gt; v1.00[CR]v0.97 - 31/01/2009[CR]- Took[CR]long enough to get here.[CR]v0.30 - 17/07/2006[CR]- Over the past week, Ive[CR]done a bunch of translation work on several files.[CR]The patch now goes up to[CR]the third town in the game. Im not exactly sure how[CR]much more stuff has[CR]been done, but the patch is around 40KB bigger now.[CR]- Ive implemented what[CR]will hopefully be the final font. I went back[CR]on my decision to use a[CR]fixed-width font because screen space is at too much[CR]of a premium to[CR]justify it. Personally, I think the current font is a[CR]huge[CR]improvement.[CR]- A bit of editing work has been done, thanks to some[CR]suggestions by editor[CR]Corvid.[CR]v0.20 - 19/03/2006[CR]- Thanks to a great[CR]amount of work by Disnesquick, I can insert dialogue text[CR]back into the[CR]game. Several dialogue files have been translated and formatted,[CR]with an[CR]aim to produce a teaser patch... this patch.[CR]- Up to the escape to the[CR]sewers translated.[CR]v0.11 - 05/06/2005[CR]-Some previously untranslated text[CR]has been translated[CR]-Some errors and bugs fixed[CR]-Names standardised to[CR]match scripts under translation[CR]v0.10 - 13/08/2002[CR]-First[CR]patch[CR]-Items, special moves, descriptions and most menus have been[CR]translated.[CR]-8x8 fonts replaced[CR]-Xx12 font inserted, VWF updated to[CR]reflect change[CR]2. About Eternal[CR]Filena[CR]================================================================================[CR]Eternal[CR]Filena is a Super Nintendo RPG, released by Tokuma Shoten Intermedia[CR]in[CR]February, 1995. Its part of a franchise that started with a series of[CR]"light[CR]novels" by Takeshi Shudo, illustrated by Akemi Takada. The story is[CR]of a girl,[CR]Filena, who has been raised as a boy and trained as a gladiator,[CR]and her[CR]struggle for Freedom.[CR]Eternal Filena was released late into the[CR]SNESs life, but despite this it has[CR]somewhat dated graphics. Its looks are[CR]remniscent of Final Fantasy V, except it[CR]looks a bit more polished in[CR]places. However, theres a kind of charm to this[CR]look, and I think it is[CR]quite endearing to old SNES gamers. As far as the music[CR]goes, youre better[CR]off judging that for yourself.[CR]The gameplay is fairly orthodox, so you wont[CR]have to struggle with a weird[CR]battle system and there isnt anything like[CR]special skill sets you have to[CR]learn, aside from the skills for each of the[CR]weapon types, which are learned[CR]by levelling up.[CR]The storys the main[CR]draw of the game, its why I decided to translate the game[CR]in the first[CR]place. Like much of the game, it may be cliched, flawed, and[CR]derivative in[CR]places, but it has a certain undeniable charm to it that makes it[CR]worth[CR]playing. In fact, despite the above, it somehow manages to combine[CR]all[CR]these elements to become, paradoxically, unique.[CR]3.[CR]Controls[CR]================================================================================[CR]D-Pad[CR]: Move in the corresponding direction, move between commands, change[CR]battle row in the menu.[CR]A : Select commands, scroll text.[CR]B : Cancel,[CR]hold to run.[CR]X : Open the menu screen.[CR]Y : Not used.[CR]L : Switch[CR]between menus.[CR]R : Switch between menus.[CR]Start : AI set-up (in-[CR]battle)[CR]Select: Not used.[CR]4.[CR]Issues[CR]================================================================================[CR]-[CR]Some of the names of party members are truncated in battle due to[CR]space[CR]limitations. This will be fixed in a follow-up patch.[CR]- The game[CR]shipped with a game-breaking bug that would cause a debug tool[CR]to appear at[CR]random and interrupt your game. You cant get out of the tool[CR]once its[CR]started. The chances of triggering this bug are low, but I recommend[CR]saving[CR]frequently just in case.[CR]5. Whats[CR]Left?[CR]================================================================================[CR]-[CR]A couple of minor hacks and improvements that I couldnt get out in time.[CR]6.[CR]The Horrible History of the Eternal Filena[CR]Translation[CR]================================================================================[CR]I[CR]WAS A FAILED HIGH SCHOOL ROM HACKER[CR]Let me tell you about this project some[CR]more. I started working on it as a high[CR]school student in 2002. In 2002, I[CR]did not really speak Japanese. I could read[CR]kana and a handful of kanji,[CR]and I had a very small bit of grammar. Back in[CR]those days, I was[CR]experimenting with ROM hacking, but I was never particularly[CR]good at it and[CR]never really got much done. (A couple years later I gave up on[CR]it.)[CR]At[CR]any rate, Eternal Filena piqued my interest. It was quirky, and was[CR]unsual[CR]for having a female lead. I set about making a non-dialogue patch[CR]for it, and[CR]I ended up needing a lot of help for it.[CR]I have a soft spot[CR]for Eternal Filena. See, the thing is, its not a very good[CR]game. The[CR]writing can be pretty awful even if the storys decent, the graphics[CR]are[CR]subpar, and the music...the music is shit. Its main selling point is[CR]that[CR]its a SNES RPG about lesbians with a decent battle system, which makes[CR]it quirky[CR]enough for me. But the part that I like about Eternal Filena the[CR]best is the[CR]translation, because it represents everything good about the[CR]ROM hacking scene.[CR]A LITTLE HELP FROM MY FRIENDS[CR]When I started the[CR]first non-dialogue patch, my Japanese was basic and my ROM[CR]hacking skills[CR]subpar. So I posted threads calling for translation help on MOs[CR]board, and[CR]got help from the likes of Tomato, D and Eien no Hen. Akujin gave me[CR]his[CR]kanji table. I got help from Gideon Zhi to deal with a compressed font,[CR]which[CR]became the basis for a tutorial on DMA transfers. More skilled[CR]hackers such as[CR]Bongo, LordTech and Nightcrawler took a look at the awful[CR]compression/scripting[CR]system for the dialogue.[CR]WHY DONT YOU JUST GO AND[CR]LEARN JAPANESE IF YOU LOVE IT SO MUCH[CR]By the time I released the non-[CR]dialogue patch, I was in university studying[CR]Japanese. While studying[CR]abroad in Japan, I volunteered to help with the[CR]translation for[CR]Disnesquicks Energy Breaker project. By this point, I was[CR]becoming quite[CR]confident as a translator, and it was around this time that I did[CR]the[CR]translation for AGTPs Star Fox 2 project. While working on Energy[CR]Breaker,[CR]I made an informal offer to Disnesquick that I would agree to[CR]translate Lady[CR]Stalker in exchange for a dump of the Filena script and an[CR]inserter. The Filena[CR]files and inserter came back pretty quickly (it turned[CR]out to have a lot in[CR]common with Energy Breaker); I only translated Lady[CR]Stalker in 2008 (got it[CR]done in the end)![CR]THINGS GET DONE[CR]I released[CR]a couple of patches featuring some initial blocks of dialogue around[CR]the[CR]time I graduated from university. Things were going pretty slow because[CR]my[CR]focus was still Energy Breaker, and it was also difficult to align my[CR]windows[CR]of enthusiasm and free time. The Lets Play thread trend erupted on[CR]Something[CR]Awful a few months later, and I decided to do something original[CR]by doing a[CR]Lets Play thread for Filena, with the gimmick being that I would[CR]translate and[CR]insert the script as I played.[CR]Despite a couple of[CR]technical hiccups, all the dialogue was translated by the[CR]beginning of[CR]2007. byuu and Bongo stepped in to help again, this time to deal[CR]with some[CR]stubborn text not covered by Disnesquicks inserter and to replace[CR]the[CR]Japanese title screen with Maegras English title screen.[CR]Things got[CR]pretty busy around then. I started doing professional work as a[CR]translator,[CR]and most of my time went towards official work. Those who took part[CR]in the[CR]failed beta test will probably remember me being very stressed out and[CR]not[CR]being able to take the time to do much of anything.[CR]As you can see,[CR]this project ended up having a fairly long history, and quite a[CR]large[CR]number of collaborators as well. It also lasted the length of my[CR]growth[CR]from failed ROM hacker to professional translator.[CR]7. This Patch[CR]Is A Work-In-Progress,[CR]Damnit[CR]================================================================================[CR]This[CR]patch is a work-in-progress.[CR]As a result, it may contain errors such as[CR]inconsistencies in the translations,[CR]typos and the like. If you spot such[CR]an error, please report it. Screenshots[CR]help greatly.[CR]8. Patching[CR]Note[CR]================================================================================[CR]Considering[CR]that not that many people will be playing this compared to titles[CR]like[CR]Tales of Phantasia or Shin Megami Tensei, I dont think I have to be[CR]very[CR]verbose here.[CR]You should know, however, that this patch was made[CR]for a ROM /WITHOUT/ a header.[CR]The size of an Eternal Filena ROM without a[CR]header is 1,572,864 bytes.[CR]A. Credits and[CR]thanks[CR]================================================================================[CR]Translation:[CR]satsu[CR]Reprogramming, dumper[CR]and inserter: Disnesquick[CR]Additional[CR]reprogramming: Bongo`, byuu, Gideon Zhi[CR]Title screen graphics:[CR]Maegra[CR]Early translation help: Tomato, Eien ni Hen, D[CR]Kanji[CR]identification: Akujin[CR]Special thanks to:[CR]Gideon Zhi, for the utterly[CR]invaluable lesson on DMA transfer.[CR]You can check out this lesson at[CR]http://agtp.romhack.net/dmalog/.[CR]Bongo`, for dumping an initial dialogue[CR]script and getting a start on the[CR]dialogue table.[CR]LordTech,[CR]Nightcrawler, and any one else I got to take a look at this games[CR]horrible[CR]guts. Extra thanks to the latter for giving me a copy of an old table[CR]when[CR]I lost mine.[CR] [CR]MO, for starting his translation board.[CR]Corvid, for[CR]pointing out some goofs and providing invaluable assistance[CR]as an[CR]editor.[CR]You.[CR]B.[CR]Reminder[CR]================================================================================[CR]Please[CR]DO NOT ask me or anyone else involved with this translation for a copy[CR]of[CR]the ROM. Furthermore, please do not bug us about progress on the game.[CR]It gets[CR]worked on when it gets worked on, and itll be done when its[CR]done.[CR]The distribution of this work as a prepatched ROM is strictly[CR]forbidden.[CR]This patch must also be distributed with this readme file.[CR]C.[CR]If youve read this[CR]far...[CR]================================================================================[CR]If[CR]youve read this far, heres a couple of treats.[CR]1.

Epileptic[CR]fit[CR]If youre sick of the game screen going nuts while Filena is temporarily[CR]blinded[CR]for part of the game, change your party line-up as in any[CR]RPG.[CR]Seriously, some people dont seem to think of doing this at all, and[CR]that part[CR]of the story lasts a good amount of time.[CR]Copyright 2009[CR]satsu, except for the bits I didnt do which are copyright[CR]to the people who[CR]did them.</plot>

    <plot>This is a remake of one of Nintendo's most famous Famicom Disk System titles.[CR]Famicom Detective Club II tells the story of a nameless fellow (you), who is[CR]taken under the wing of Shunsuke Utsugi, a private detective, after he is[CR]found on the street escaping from the police. Your character is assigned a[CR]case by Utsugi - to locate the person that murdered a schoolgirl near a[CR]waterway. And that's all I can say without spoiling the game! You play this[CR]just like those classic Sierra text adventures: you go around places and ask[CR]people questions, check evidence, and dig up clues from within the crime[CR]scenes. It may seem tiring at first, but as the game goes on, the story keeps[CR]getting better and better. If you're a fan of detective stories in general,[CR]you'll love this game.[CR]Read Me:[CR].,g8$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$"""""$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$8g,.

Oh man...[CR]its 7pm and Ive been working on the final ,d$b.[CR]` $$ touches on this game[CR]since I woke up, so like, this $$ [CR] qb readme is probably gonna come out[CR]all weird. `qb [CR],d$b. ,d$b.[CR]$$ This has been a project of mine for about[CR]the last year ` $$[CR]`qb and a half. I got into shortly after we finished[CR]work on qb[CR],d$b. Radical Dreamers, when Tomato brought it to my attention.[CR],d$b.[CR]` $$ Apparently hed been shopping it around to a few of us $$ [CR] qb[CR]translators after hed decided he didnt have enough time `qb [CR],d$b. to work[CR]on it himself. At the time he approached me, the ,d$b.[CR]$$ most help hed[CR]gotten so far was from Bongo -- hed ` $$[CR]`qb written a partially functional[CR]variable-width font for qb[CR],d$b. the game. In addition, Tomato had dumped[CR]some preliminary ,d$b.[CR]` $$ japanese scripts himself. $$ [CR] qb `qb[CR],d$b. So when I (Demi) took on the project, I took a look at ,d$b.[CR]$$[CR]the total amount of progress that had been made on it, ` $$[CR]`qb and went[CR]from there. I expanded the rom and remapped all qb[CR],d$b. text pointers,[CR]recoded the variable width font (Bongo, ,d$b.[CR]` $$ you were closer than you[CR]may have thought), redumped the $$ [CR] qb script into a proprietary format[CR]similar to my Radical `qb [CR],d$b. Dreamers script, and translated the game[CR]from scratch. ,d$b.[CR]$$ ` $$[CR]`qb To give you some sense of the scope of[CR]this project, I qb[CR],d$b. think Ive worked like 5 or 6 different places ever[CR]since ,d$b.[CR]` $$ I started this translation. Im a consultant though, so $$[CR] qb thats not really bad at all. But man, this one job I `qb [CR],d$b.[CR]had, it SUCKED, okay? Well, no, the job was cool (I was ,d$b.[CR]$$ editing[CR]childrens books for McGraw Hill)... the ` $$[CR]`qb management was just kind[CR]of incompetent. At one point, I qb[CR],d$b. got so sick of all the bureaucracy[CR]there, I started ,d$b.[CR]` $$ working on this translation there in the office[CR]instead $$ [CR] qb of doing the miniscule amount of work assigned to me. So[CR]`qb [CR],d$b. like, in addition to how you are most likely breaking the[CR],d$b.[CR]$$ law because of playing this game with a stolen rom, rest `[CR]$$[CR]`qb assured in knowing that you are further corrupting your qb[CR],d$b.[CR]soul by playing a translated game which was partially ,d$b.[CR]` $$ created on[CR]a Fortune 500 companys dime, without their $$ [CR] qb foreknowledge or[CR]consent. Booyah. `qb [CR],d$b. ,d$b.[CR]$$ Anyhow, back to the lecture at[CR]hand. FuSoYa was once ` $$[CR]`qb again at my side when it came time to hack[CR]the graphics. qb[CR],d$b. He helped me out bigtime with Radical Dreamers and[CR]he was ,d$b.[CR]` $$ no less the lifesaver here. The graphics were compressed,[CR]$$ [CR] qb but he managed to crack the compression in like 5 seconds `qb[CR],d$b. or something. He then built me a custom version of his ,d$b.[CR]$$[CR]Lunar Compress tool in no time, which allowed for the ` $$[CR]`qb compression[CR]/ insertion of FDC2 format graphics. qb[CR],d$b. Inserting my art (the title[CR]image, the chapter names, ,d$b.[CR]` $$ etc) into the rom was a snap -- his[CR]util never failed me $$ [CR] qb once. Big ups to FuSoYa on this one. Damn you[CR]got a funky `qb [CR],d$b. name dude. ,d$b.[CR]$$ ` $$[CR]`qb As I finished up[CR]the translation, I invited a few of my qb[CR],d$b. Radical Dreamers beta[CR]testers to come test the game. One ,d$b.[CR]` $$ of the guys who really got[CR]into it was Haeleth; he went $$ [CR] qb above and beyond the call of duty to[CR]really get into the `qb [CR],d$b. script and offer a lot of retranslations for[CR]things that ,d$b.[CR]$$ werent up to snuff. I really appreciated it, and so,[CR]he ` $$[CR]`qb got co-translator credit on this project. This release[CR]qb[CR],d$b. wouldnt have been half of what it is with you, bud! ,d$b.[CR]` $$[CR]Thanks! $$ [CR] qb `qb [CR],d$b. ,d$b.[CR]$$ ` $$[CR]`qb qb[CR],d$b.[CR],d$b.[CR]` $$ GAME INFO: $$ [CR] qb `qb [CR],d$b. This is actually a remake of[CR]a Famicom Disk System game, ,d$b.[CR]$$ which is in itself a prequel to[CR]Famicom Detective Club ` $$[CR]`qb Part I. FDC1 is elite, I mean, I wanna find[CR]out what qb[CR],d$b. happens after the events in this game and everything, but[CR],d$b.[CR]` $$ I just cant seem to get into those nappy 8-bit graphics. $$ [CR]qb `qb [CR],d$b. There was a third game released for the SNES Satellaview[CR],d$b.[CR]$$ add-on, but I havent gotten too far into it. All I know `[CR]$$[CR]`qb is that the characters mouths move really weird when qb[CR],d$b.[CR]they talk in it. Its like watching cats lick their ,d$b.[CR]` $$ butts... you[CR]cant seem to look away. $$ [CR] qb `qb [CR],d$b. I dont wanna sound like Im[CR]kissing this games ass too ,d$b.[CR]$$ much, but its really got an intricate[CR]story. Theres ` $$[CR]`qb been more than a few times where Ive found myself[CR]going qb[CR],d$b. "man, are these mystery stories as difficult to write as[CR],d$b.[CR]` $$ I think they are?" -- I dunno though, theres a shitload $$ [CR]qb of Law and Order and CSI and whatever on TV right now. `qb [CR],d$b. But to[CR]be fair, those shows pale in comparison to the ,d$b.[CR]$$ hidden treasure[CR]that is Phamicom Detective Club Part Deux. ` $$[CR]`qb qb[CR],d$b. Tomato and[CR]Haeleth are the resident experts on Famicom ,d$b.[CR]` $$ Detective Club[CR]games. Tomato got me interested in the $$ [CR] qb series, and I know he spent[CR]a period of time when he got `qb [CR],d$b. deep into all kinds of oldskool[CR]text-based horror story ,d$b.[CR]$$ games like this. Haeleth on the other hand[CR]spent tons of ` $$[CR]`qb time on Japanese websites in order to get to know[CR]FDC2 so qb[CR],d$b. well that he was able to beta test the hell out of it.[CR],d$b.[CR]` $$ Sometimes he would figure stuff out, and Id just be like $$ [CR]qb "Uhh... yeah! Of course I knew about that! Yeah..." `qb [CR],d$b. Anyhow,[CR]if you want to know more about games like this, ,d$b.[CR]$$ these are your[CR]guys. ` $$[CR]`qb qb[CR],d$b. Finally, Id like to mention that I recently[CR]started to ,d$b.[CR]` $$ look into translating FDC1, but I dont know if Im[CR]going $$ [CR] qb to undertake it if its as difficult as Im afraid it is. `qb[CR],d$b. I heard a while ago that some people were once trying to ,d$b.[CR]$$[CR]translate this (I think Ive heard Necrosaros name ` $$[CR]`qb tossed around[CR]once or twice) but I dont think Ive ever qb[CR],d$b. heard anything about it[CR]publically. Ive got the script ,d$b.[CR]` $$ dumped almost the way I want it,[CR]but Im having a few $$ [CR] qb issues with the pointers. So, if theres anybody[CR]whod `qb [CR],d$b. like to share some knowledge on FDC1, please dont[CR],d$b.[CR]$$ hesitate to ask. Haeleth has agreed to translate it once `[CR]$$[CR]`qb a decent script is produced, and I dont want to keep him qb[CR],d$b.[CR]waiting. ,d$b.[CR]` $$ $$ [CR] qb `qb [CR],d$b. ,d$b.[CR]$$ ` $$[CR]`qb[CR]qb[CR],d$b. PATCHING INSTRUCTIONS: ,d$b.[CR]` $$ $$ [CR] qb There are two[CR]versions of the Japanese rom out there: `qb [CR],d$b. 1.0 and 1.1. You gotta[CR]use 1.0 with this patch. Using ,d$b.[CR]$$ this patch on a 1.1 rom will make[CR]it break.

    <plot>FEDA, I believe, is one of those games that could have done well if it had[CR]been published in the USA. It is a strategy RPG with a lot of depth, and is[CR]probably most similar to the Shining Force series published by Sega. The game[CR]has some kickin' graphics, but the music is kinda ho-hum, but I'm playing it[CR]on an emulator so it probably sounds totally cool on a real SNES. Anyway, give[CR]the game a try, I'm sure you'll totally love it. Unless you're Spinner 8. Then[CR]you'll try it and totally die a lot.</plot>

    <plot>Final Fantasy IV is a role playing game for the Super Nintendo.[CR]Read[CR]Me:[CR]FINAL FANTASY IV[CR]RE-TRANSLATION / REVISION v3.21 10th Anniversary[CR]Edition [07/03/2001] [M/D/Y][CR]J2E[CR]TRANSLATIONS[CR]http://www.j2etranslations.com[CR]http://www.j2e.org[CR]J2e@j2e.org[CR]---------------------------------[CR]CONTENTS[CR]1.[CR]TRANSLATION HISTORY[CR]2. WHY RE-TRANSLATE?[CR]3. J2E STAFF[CR]4. SPECIAL[CR]NOTES[CR]5. APPLYING THE IPS PATCH[CR]6. HOW YOU CAN HELP[CR]7. COPYWRIGHT[CR]PERMISSIONS[CR]---------------------------------[CR]1. TRANSLATION[CR]HISTORY[CR]The FF4j translation was much more than just any[CR]ordinary[CR]translation. What started off as several different[CR]independent[CR]translation projects in competition with each other has[CR]become[CR]one of the biggest translation projects/groups on the[CR]net![CR]Through working together J2e Translations has achieved[CR]great goals[CR]that have, and will continue to revolutionize the[CR]translation scene! For a[CR]little history, most of the small[CR]FF4 translations started around August of[CR]1997. These included[CR]several groups known as the Silicon Travelers,[CR]HELLSTORM[CR]TRANSLATIONS, and more! All of these groups had mainly[CR]decided[CR]to translate the japanese version of FF4 mostly to gain[CR]ROM-[CR]HACKING experience due to the lack of translators in the[CR]scene at the time.[CR]These groups had been using the[CR]american version of Final Fantasy 4, known[CR]as Final Fantasy 2[CR]here, as a base and reference to their FF4[CR]translations.[CR]Anyways, at the time the 3 biggest FF4 translation groups[CR]were[CR]HELLSTORM TRANSLATIONS, a solo translation carried out by[CR]Anus P.,[CR]Blasted2/Necrosaro translation group, who else coulda[CR]been in it??, and the[CR]Silicon travelers, headed by P-Funk.[CR]Around the end of November/beginning[CR]of December was when[CR]big things started to happen. Apparently at the[CR]time[CR]The Silicon Travelers seemed to have died out, and Anus P.[CR]joined[CR]up with Blasted2 and Necrosaro to form a completely[CR]new translation group[CR]known as J2e translations. Also at that[CR]time we managed to get other people[CR]to do some great things for[CR]us. We had contacted Ian Kelly, the man[CR]responsible for[CR]creating the useful FF4/2us differences document, only[CR]to[CR]learn that he had been translating FF4 for someone else already.[CR]But[CR]after talking for a bit, we managed to get some help,[CR]and Ian Kelly had[CR]decided to translate the scripts for us[CR]as soon as we got them all dumped![CR]Also at that time, we had[CR]met a guy named Joke, responisble for translating[CR]FF4 to Thai.[CR]This guy was a great guy. He was able to use FF2uss code[CR]for[CR]Dual-Tile Encoding and incorporate it into FF4j! What Dual-[CR]Tile[CR]Encoding enabled us to do was store 2 letters as one byte in[CR]the[CR]rom, thus letting us have as much text as we needed without[CR]needing[CR]to expand the rom size! So while Ian Kelly was[CR]translating those scripts we[CR]decided to take the text from FF2us[CR]and paste it into FF4j, thus giving us[CR]a temporary patch to[CR]release! A little bit later however, we had learned[CR]that[CR]The Silicon Travelers was alive and well! Although now the[CR]only 2[CR]members of it were P-Funk and Rydia, another useful[CR]translator! So we had[CR]finally gotten ourselves competition again,[CR]especially since P-Funk was[CR]learning ASM HACKING at the time![CR]But we had then talked with him and got[CR]him to join J2e with us.[CR]This meant we now had an ASM HACKER, and another[CR]translator![CR]also because of the fact that Dark Force was responsible[CR]for[CR]teaching P-Funk ASM, we had also managed to get him on our team![CR]It[CR]was at that point that we had decided to drop DTE in our[CR]translation and[CR]use ROM-Expansion to fit all the text in.[CR]Although Rom Expansion wasnt[CR]needed at the time because of DTE,[CR]it had allowed us to use FF4s original[CR]Dual-Tile Encoding to[CR]print out 2 tile vertically instead of 2 tiles[CR]horizontally.[CR]What this let us do was bring a new 16x8 font into the[CR]game[CR]rather than the old 8x8! The person behind this was Anus P. He[CR]had[CR]also made it so that the old 8x8 font was still in the game.[CR]Shortly after[CR]all this, and the main scripts had been translated,[CR]J2e had revolutionized[CR]translations once again by devising new[CR]script insertion methods which a[CR]couple of well known groups have[CR]adopted from us. The program used to make[CR]these insertions[CR]was created by Necrosaro. Originally it was[CR]designed[CR]specifically for FF4, but has recently been released to[CR]the[CR]public as "Thingy". These script insertion methods allowed us[CR]to[CR]make changes to the scripts easily, and it was less time-[CR]consuming.[CR]Once the main scripts were in FF4, however, Dark Force had[CR]introduced[CR]us to a guy named Trainspotter. He is an expert in[CR]japanese[CR]translating, and script revising. Thats when the FF4j[CR]translation[CR]became a translation/revision. He had perfected the scripts to[CR]sound[CR]a lot better and make the overall game play more enjoyable![CR]We[CR]released the translation earlier last year, but we have since expanded[CR]many[CR]windows and lines of text for an even more professional[CR]quality[CR]translation. In fact this version almost looks like a completely[CR]different[CR]hack from the last release.[CR]Enjoy![CR]---------------------------------[CR]2. WHY RE-TRANSLATE?[CR]Why[CR]would we re-translate a game already translated here in[CR]North America?[CR]Simple... Square Soft did a HORRIBLE job[CR]translating this game! They used[CR]bad english, tons of[CR]abbreviations, and censored out many important parts[CR]of the story[CR]that were in the japanese scripts! Also FF2us was based on[CR]FF4j[CR]Easytype, which was alot easier than the hardtype version which[CR]is[CR]what we translated. Also in the Easytype version many things[CR](like[CR]items and stuff) were censored out, but with this[CR]translation you get[CR]everything that was origianally[CR]meant to be in FF4! including the ever[CR]famous Porno Mag! hehehe[CR]---------------------------------[CR]3.

    <plot>Final Fantasy V is a role playing game for the Super Nintendo. The game was[CR]released in the States as part of the Final Fantasy Anthology, complete with[CR]Ted Woolsey's script that was done before the SNES Square translation was[CR]scrapped. The game is pretty straightforward Final Fantasy, except for the Job[CR]System that the characters use. You have a large selection of jobs, and[CR]there's no penalty in switching from one job to another (unlike FFIII).[CR]Battles earn you points that go towards leveling up these jobs, which give you[CR]extra abilities.[CR]Read Me:[CR] --------------------------[CR] | Final[CR]Fantasy V |[CR] --------------------------[CR]++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++[CR] + Unofficial English[CR]Translation +[CR] ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++[CR] +[CR]October 17th, 1998 - Version 1.10 +[CR]++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++[CR]* Note * - Please do[CR]NOT distribute the patch file without[CR]this file, since it contains[CR]important information.[CR] This is an UNOFFICIAL English translation of[CR]FINAL[CR]FANTASY V, the SQUARESOFT RPG everyones been wanting to[CR]play for[CR]ages now.

The first efforts to[CR]translate this game[CR]date back to April 1997, by Shadow. Many others[CR]were[CR]involved in the project, but it basically ended up being[CR]myself,[CR]Barubary, and SoM2Freak. After almost 10 months[CR]since I joined the project,[CR]and it was finally released as[CR]a complete version. Since then, several[CR]mistakes have[CR]been fixed, and eventually this version is being[CR]released.[CR]----------------------------------------------------------[CR]3.[CR]How to Start[CR]----------------------------------------------------------[CR]The archive includes an IPS file. The IPS file is to be[CR]applied to ROM[CR]images acquired from somewhere else, and[CR]its up to you to obtain it.[CR]First, you need a copy of the Final Fantasy V ROM image,[CR]and an IPS[CR]patching program. An easy-to-use patching[CR]program for MS-DOS based systems,[CR]IPS.EXE, can be obtained[CR]at RPGe (http://fx.ml.org/rpge/archives/).[CR]This patch must be applied to the ORIGINAL, unmodified[CR]ROM.[CR] To use[CR]IPS.EXE with the Final Fantasy V patch, get[CR]yourself a DOS prompt and type[CR]the following:[CR] IPS FF5.SMC FF5-V110.IPS[CR] Replace FF5.SMC with the[CR]filename of your ROM image.[CR] After youve patched your ROM image, load the[CR]game[CR]inside your favorite SNES emulator, and you should see the[CR]title[CR]screen.

If you are using ZSNES to play[CR]this game, then you[CR]can simply place the IPS file in the same directory as[CR]your save files,[CR]and ZSNES will automatically read the patch and apply it,[CR]without[CR]changing your original ROM. The IPS file must be named the same as[CR]your[CR]ROM for this to work.[CR]If you are using another emulator, you will[CR]have to patch the game[CR]manually. IPS.exe and Snestool are two common[CR]programs that can do[CR]this, and they can be found at most emulation and[CR]translation websites.[CR]Before patching your ROM, *always* make sure you keep[CR]a backup copy.[CR]To use IPS.exe, type this at a command prompt:[CR]IPS[CR]where  is the name and location of the ROM to be patched, and[CR] is the[CR]name and location of the IPS file to be used.[CR]Snestool has a graphic[CR]interface and doesnt require command line[CR]arguments. After loading it,[CR]select the "Use IPS" option. Then find the[CR]IPS file in the browser window[CR]to the left and select it. After that,[CR]select the ROM that the IPS should[CR]be applied to.[CR]The unpatched file size should be 3146240 bytes. The patched[CR]file size [CR]should be 3441152 bytes. Any variation in the patched file size[CR]would be down [CR]to your patching utility and not the IPS file; it would also[CR]cause [CR]problems with running the ROM image.[CR]There are two versions[CR]available of the Front Mission ROM image, version 1.0[CR]and version 1.1.[CR]Ver1.1 has a lot of internal changes, though nothing which[CR]makes the[CR]gameplay any different. It does, however, make the Front Mission[CR]translation patch incompatable with it.[CR]If the translation patch is[CR]applied to a ver1.1 image, the game will inform[CR]you upon startup that it[CR]has been patched to the incorrect version and will[CR]progress no[CR]further.[CR]================[CR]Running the Game[CR]================[CR]The[CR]best medium would be a real 60Hz S-NES (via back-up unit) displayed[CR]via a[CR]RGB SCART cable.[CR]At the moment, the latest version of ZSNES doesnt display[CR]the overhead[CR]island map[CR]correctly.[CR]==========[CR]Disclaimer[CR]==========[CR]"Front Mission" is[CR](c)1996 by SquareSoft.[CR]This work is unofficial and is not supported by[CR]them.[CR]This patch may be freely distributed, as long as:[CR] - The patch[CR]remains unmodified (including "retranslations").[CR] - This readme file[CR]accompanies the patch.[CR] - The ROM image is not distributed with this patch[CR]already applied.[CR]This patch is not for sale, and is not to be exchanged for[CR]money,[CR]goods, or services of any[CR]kind.[CR]========================================[CR]Quick Thank Yous and[CR]Greetings from FH[CR]========================================[CR]Chris Kim -[CR]For starting me on this insane journey, and[CR] contributing his efforts in[CR]the early stages.[CR]David Mullen - For being dedicated to this and all his[CR]translation[CR] projects.[CR]Hojo - For giving his skills when no one else[CR]would.[CR]Akujin - For showing us the light! =) And being the fastest[CR]translator on this planet! :)[CR]Shih Tzu - For his assistance, and also[CR]putting up with my mood[CR] swings! ;)[CR]Darkforce - For his inspiration and[CR]chats.[CR]NoComply - For putting up with me!! =P Plus being the[CR] St.[CR]Nicholas of console development! ;&gt;[CR]Jason Li - For publicity at a time we[CR]didnt have any.[CR] Plus being a sane person to talk to! :)[CR]My Family - For[CR]being there.[CR]My Work Buddies - Ditto.[CR]Thom Pratt - For patiently waiting[CR]for me to add his Papuwa title[CR] screen!! ^_^[CR]FM Fans - Thanks for all[CR]the positive E-Mails you sent!! ^^</plot>

    <plot>Front Mission: Gun Hazard is a sidescrolling action game. And as a[CR]sidescrolling action game, it has nothing to do gameplay-wise (or story-wise,[CR]debatably) with the other Front Mission games. This is why I actually enjoy[CR]Gun Hazard. Apparently the same team who did Cybernator/Assault Suits Valken[CR]did this game, and it's pretty apparent from playing them both. You walk[CR]around in your Wanzer and shoot things. And you sometimes punch things. At the[CR]start your duty is to protect the President from a coup at the hands of a[CR]powerful general, but I'm sure that All Is Not What It Seems, as is usually[CR]the case. Just to remind you that yes, you're playing Front Mission, you're[CR]given a wide assortment of equipment you can use to equip your mech however[CR]you see fit. It isn't the exhausting overwhelming chore like in the other FM[CR]games, though. It seems pretty standard to me. Hey, do you want your normal[CR]gun or this shotgun? Stuff like that. The soundtrack, provided by a variety of[CR]Square talent (but mostly the heroes Nobuo Uematsu and Yasunori Mitsuda) is[CR]fucking excellent. Sometimes I wonder why Uematsu gets all this overwhelming[CR]adulation just for composing music for a particularly popular RPG series, but[CR]God damn his music rocks. Better recognize![CR]Read Me:[CR]FRONT MISSION:[CR]GUN HAZARD[CR]ENGLISH TRANSLATION V1.01[CR]Copyright 2004 Aeon[CR]Genesis[CR]http://agtp.romhack.net[CR]ToC[CR]1.About Front Mission: Gun[CR]Hazard[CR]2.Patch History[CR]3.Patch Credits and Contributors[CR]4.Known[CR]Issues[CR]5.Application[CR]Instructions[CR]6.Troubleshooting[CR]---------------------------[CR]1.Front[CR]Mission: Gun Hazard[CR]---------------------------[CR]FM:GH is a gaiden, of[CR]sorts, unrelated to the "traditional" Front[CR]Mission timeline. It also plays[CR]unlike any of the others -- it is[CR]a sidescroller, developed in concert with[CR]members of the team who[CR]made Assault Suits: Valken. That does not mean that[CR]it doesnt have[CR]Squares trademark RPG elements to it, rather, your character[CR]can[CR]gain levels, upgrade his equipment, customize his Wanzer, and[CR]bring[CR]allies into battle. It is a fairly long game, sporting just[CR]under[CR]a full hundred levels to blast through, and it can get[CR]fairly[CR]difficult at times.[CR]---------------[CR]2.Patch[CR]History[CR]---------------[CR]This project is four years old. Im extremely[CR]happy to finally be[CR]able to launch it, but in the description of the[CR]history, some[CR]things are invariably going to fall by the wayside.[CR]I[CR]started work identifying the storage method for the script[CR]nearly four[CR]years ago. Since the games alphabet was stored in an[CR]optimized order,[CR]rather than an alphabetical order, I was forced[CR]to made-do with a few[CR]letters that actually -were- in alphabetical[CR]order and I based my[CR]conversion table off of that.[CR]akujin came along, I dont remember when[CR]exactly, and agreed to help[CR]dump and translate the script. It took a while,[CR]better part of a year[CR]probably, and there was number of nasty issues with[CR]the script itself:[CR]lots of conditional jumps (has-wanzer clauses, ally-[CR]present clauses,[CR]event flag tests, etc) not to mention actual 65816[CR]assembly code built[CR]directly into the script. This obviously would require[CR]specialized[CR]equipment to reinsert.[CR]Enter Klarth, programmer[CR]extraordinaire, who sat down to write one of[CR]the most versatile script[CR]insertion utilities ever created for the[CR]purposes of romhacking. It was[CR]called "Atlas", in part because it allowed[CR]the user to "map" out pointers[CR]in script files, but it was also named[CR]after the orbital elevator in the[CR]game many of its features were built[CR]for. The creation and tweaking of[CR]Atlas took quite a long time, and[CR]development still continues to this day[CR](I think.)[CR]Afterwards, the script was insertable, but that did not[CR]necessarily mean[CR]that it would fit back into the space allotted it. This[CR]was wonderfully[CR]bad news, as even after rigging up some simple compression[CR]for the games[CR]text which granted us a tremendous amount of extra space, it[CR]still did not[CR]fit.[CR]This prompted a long-time fan of the game, M, to step[CR]forward and offer[CR]to polish and condense the games text. It was a long and[CR]grueling[CR]process, and it was another good year before the games text[CR]finally fit.[CR]Some things inevitably ended up getting clipped, but the end[CR]result is,[CR]I feel, much more refined due to the numerous revisions than it[CR]would have[CR]been if we did not have the strict space constrains the ROM[CR]imposed upon[CR]us.[CR]Long story short, once the writing was done and M was[CR]available to bat[CR]things back and forth off of, the remainder of the project[CR]went fairly[CR]quickly, and here we are![CR]August 13, 2004 - Initial version[CR]1.00 Release[CR]August 13, 2004 - Initial version 1.01 Release[CR]--Fixes a[CR]few text issues that got saved to the wrong file prior to the[CR]release.[CR]---------------[CR]3.Patch Credits[CR]---------------[CR]THE FRONT[CR]MISSION: GUN HAZARD TEAM[CR]Main Team:[CR]Gideon Zhi - Project leader,[CR]Romhacker[CR]akujin - Translation[CR]M - Lead script editor and[CR]writer[CR]Klarth - Utility Programmer[CR]--------------[CR]4.Known[CR]Issues[CR]--------------[CR]--Some testers have experienced a glitch in a[CR]particular scene near[CR] the end of the game where the screen turns green and[CR]the game locks[CR] up. This has happened extremely sporadically and I have not[CR]been[CR] able to duplicate it; for all I know, it may have been a fluke.[CR]The game reportedly will unlock itself given a minute or two.[CR]--The game[CR]will occasionally "drop" a letter from a string when its[CR] writing text to[CR]the screen.

    <plot>Funaki Masakatsu Hybrid Wrestler: Tougi Denshou is a wrestling game for the[CR]Super Nintendo.[CR]Read Me:[CR]Funaki Masakatsu Hybrid Wrestler - Tougi[CR]Denshou English translation[CR]-------------------------[CR]1. About this[CR]translation[CR]-------------------------[CR]This translation along with many[CR]other wrestling translations, were originally hosted on two sites[CR](www.firewrestling.com and the authors official homepage.) When both sites[CR]went offline, they took the files with them. Thankfully, using the archive.org[CR]search engine, this file along with many of the other translations were[CR]salvaged.[CR]The following info is from the archived[CR]website[CR]----------[CR]2. History[CR]----------[CR]Hybrid Wrestler caught my[CR]eye due to its career mode. I had read some Internet reviews of the game that[CR]had originally made me not too interested in playing the game, but I soon[CR]realized that the evaluations I had read were not correct. Hybrid uses a move[CR]system similar to the Fire Pro series and also adds a lot of gimmicks that[CR]appear in wrestling. Among these are scaffold matches and street fights. Also,[CR]wrestlers can use foreign objects, like boards, to whack their opponents.[CR]Unlike the Fire Pro series, Hybrid has no grapple system which make the[CR]gameplay more like arcade-style. Overall, the game is just fun. There is no[CR]particularly amazing part of the design, but it is one that, to my knowledge,[CR]has never been done before.[CR]I worked on a translation by context, as I dont[CR]know Japanese, for quite a while. I never really expected anything to come of[CR]it other than a personal hack, but it turned out that I was able to find a[CR]large number of the labels in the ROM and provide decent replacements in[CR]English, even for the announcements. TakerDude (Dan) was going to help me[CR]finish up the patch and sent the name translations for the wrestlers, but has[CR]since gotten busy, so I decided to go ahead and provide the work-in-progress[CR]patch.[CR]Well, I had some extra time a few weeks back and bought a Japanese[CR]dictionary. This helped me to finish up the translation of Hybrid. This is[CR]still a translation by context, but the game is considerably more playable. I[CR]think almost all of the text is translated, but it is hard to tell due to the[CR]layout of the ROM.[CR]-----------[CR]3. Patching[CR]-----------[CR]Simply[CR]patch the ROM using your favourate patching program[CR]------[CR]4.[CR]Q&amp;A;[CR]------[CR]Q: How do you do the special moves in Hybrid?[CR]A: Check[CR]out the Moves FAQ.[CR]Q: Whats the lineage option?[CR]A: This shows your[CR]family tree. In career mode, you can train your son once he turns 18. He will[CR]have your same outfit and will inherit your finisher automatically.[CR]Q: How[CR]do you do the power up move that you get from the training option in the[CR]career mode?[CR]A: I dont know. Ive wasnt able to figure it out and Ive never[CR]seen any of the moves done by a CP controlled player either.[CR]Q: How do you[CR]select the variations of moves (ie. I saw Silver do a Brain Buster)?[CR]A:[CR]Check out the Moves FAQ[CR]Q: What moves can you get from the special training[CR]in the career mode?[CR]A: Check out the Moves FAQ.

    <plot>Madness, that is how this game is easily explained. It is a neat platform game[CR]where you play Ackman, who harvests souls for Satan. Ackman is able to run[CR]around from left to right and obtain different power-ups as he collects souls.[CR]How he collects the souls is his little red demon buddy named Bodom. Yet as[CR]the main characters of the game, they need to have enemies. Throughout the[CR]game, Ackman must face hordes of angels that are trying to stop him from[CR]obtaining souls for Satan. He is challenged and faced by Tenshi, who is his[CR]rival counterpart angel. Tenshi helps add a little flavor into the game. Yet,[CR]the humor of the game is amazing. It is filled with extremely funny bits and[CR]pieces that will help the player follow the storyline of the game. What really[CR]sticks out is the facal expressions of the different characters of the game.[CR]Because, they really help set the mood of the game with a nice comical[CR]background. However, the music in the game is ok for it's generation. It's[CR]pretty much stereotypical music that sometimes feels out of place in the[CR]enviroment of the levels. What really drives my button is the sound in the[CR]game. The sound is annoying. It nearly drives me insane from the start. When[CR]Ackman jumps, it makes this sound that really is more confusing than what it[CR]should be.[CR]Read Me:[CR]Go Go Ackman1 English[CR]patch[CR]http://tasam.com/~voltron/ackman[CR]version[CR]1.0[CR]Contributers:[CR]-Rom hacking: Equinox(equinox@fireduck.com)[CR]-Script[CR]Translation:[CR]Akujin(http://members.xoom.com/_XMCM/akujin_/index.html)[CR]-Initial Spot[CR]translation: Teunire[CR]What might be done in future:[CR]-Reword a few[CR]lines[CR]-Get rid of ugly font[CR]Tools used:[CR]-thingy[CR]-hexposure[CR]-hex[CR]workshop[CR]-NJ star[CR]-relsearch[CR]Thanks to:[CR]-Akujin for showing me the[CR]empty space in the rom along with the wonderful translation work[CR]-Jair for[CR]having such a wonderful tuturial at http://fly.to/vale to get me started</plot>

    <plot>Marine and his friends went out for a day of fun at the Jelly Land Amusment[CR]Park. It was a fun day, lots of laughs. It was a real riot until a mysterious[CR]jester showed up.

As you play, you'll rescue Marine's friends.[CR]Each of them has a special talent, which will enable you to find your way[CR]through various puzzles, in order to find all the secrets.

    <plot>Jikkyou Power Pro Wrestling '96 - Max Voltage is a fighting game for the Super[CR]Nintendo. The game was released in Japan only.[CR]Read Me:[CR]Jikkyo Power[CR]Pro Wresling English translation[CR]-------------------------[CR]1. About this[CR]translation[CR]-------------------------[CR]This translation along with many[CR]other wrestling translations, were originally hosted on two sites[CR](www.firewrestling.com and the authors official homepage.) When both sites[CR]went offline, they took the files with them. Thankfully, using the archive.org[CR]search engine, this file along with many of the other translations were[CR]salvaged.[CR]The following info is from the archived[CR]website[CR]----------[CR]2. History[CR]----------[CR]This is an unusual game.[CR]Jikkyo is one of the games that is mediocre in most aspects, but is[CR]outstanding in a few. However, those few count for a lot. Jikkyo has a high[CR]degree of graphic definition (it looks more realistic than most other games on[CR]the SNES) which acts as a double-edged sword. It makes the screenshots look[CR]incredible and actually does add to the realism of the game, but it prevents[CR]any matches where more than two people are active. In other words, no Battle[CR]Royals and no realistic tag matches. It does have tag matches, but the[CR]partners that are out of the ring are frozen. This is because the processor[CR]could not handle doing AI for more than two people and refreshing the graphics[CR]on time. To see this effect in action, play WCW Nitro on PSX and watch what[CR]happens to the game when a run-in occurs.[CR]However, the basic matches are[CR]not really the point of interest in Jikkyo. Jikkyo contains a career mode[CR]called Max Voltage where you start as a rookie wrestler and work your way up[CR]through different federations, choosing when to train and how. As far as I[CR]know, no other game has ever tried to make a career mode of this type. Due[CR]solely to the presence of this mode, I decided to try to translate Jikkyo.[CR]Once again, Sydra agreed to help with the translation (which is obvious since[CR]Im writing this entry) and I set to trying to figure out how to put the text[CR]in.[CR]Well, this game is a nightmare. Translating this game is a truly[CR]masochistic experience. Unlike BPW and SFPWXP, labels sizes cannot be changed,[CR]which is requiring some really creative abbreviations on my part. So far, Ive[CR]been able to insert moves names into Max Voltage and wreslter names (Sydra and[CR]others informed me that translating names is unreliable at best, not to[CR]mention time consuming- so I just made up some based on the characters[CR]portraits). I have also put in most of the menus options that are commonly[CR]known. If anyone knows the meaning of other stuff that is still not done or,[CR]by some bizarre twist of luck, can read Japanese, please email me. This game[CR]is too big for any one person to try to translate. Due to an oversight when[CR]originally writing this page, I left out the fact that most of the information[CR]for the translation, up to this point at least, has come from Kactus Kens[CR]Jikkyo FAQ. Sorry. Anyway, heres the goods. [CR]-----------[CR]3.[CR]Patching[CR]-----------[CR]Simply patch the ROM using your favourate patching[CR]program[CR]----------------[CR]4. Training note[CR]----------------[CR]In the[CR]game, you periodically get status messages that inform you of the current[CR]training status. Unfortunately, these messages were far too short to put in[CR]decent translations. After examining them, most labels are the same and[CR]basically are uninteresting characterizations of distinct levels of the[CR]attributed (for example, the mediocre states message for all attributes is[CR]something along the line of "You have more --- than some others" while the[CR]best message is "Superb ---"). So, in short, Ive had to replace these phrases[CR]with a simple letter coding system based on grades given in American schools[CR](this is similar to how SFPW6MS rates the effectiveness of moves in the edit[CR]menu). Superb =&gt; A; Good =&gt; B; Mediocre =&gt; C; Poor =&gt; D; Very Bad =&gt; F. In[CR]addition, the fourth statistic, weight, is not on a similar scale since you[CR]are aspiring to stay in the middle of the range rather than get to the top.[CR]So, for weight, we have Morbidly Obese =&gt; +3; Overweight =&gt; +2; Slightly[CR]Overweight =&gt; +1; Ideal =&gt; 0; Slightly Underweight =&gt; -1; Underweight =&gt; -2;[CR]Dangerously Underweight =&gt; -3. Also, when these stats change, a similar[CR]message is given, but rather than a ranking, a +/-/0 is given to denote an[CR]increase in rank, decrease, or insignificant change. This system should also[CR]make it a bit more straight-forward to train since it states exactly what is[CR]happening without disguising it with rhetoric. [CR]------[CR]5.[CR]Q&amp;A;[CR]------[CR]Q: Are you planning to translate the Max Voltage[CR]section?[CR]A: Im working on that currently. A few translators have come and[CR]gone, but the fellow Im working with right now is looking promising.[CR]Q: Is[CR]there a way to enter my name in English?[CR]A: Unfortunately, no. Unlike other[CR]games like BPW and SFPWXP, Jikkyo does not even provide a complete character[CR]set of English characters. The game, luckily, used enough English and Roman[CR]characters in its Japanese version to require every uppercase letter except[CR]for a Q. Also, unlike the other games, Jikkyo does not use a character format[CR]that can be editted by any of the utilities that I know of, so you cannot[CR]"hack" in a character set (as I did with BPW). Sorry, youll just have to make[CR]due with Japanese.[CR]Q: How long til you finish translating Max[CR]Voltage?[CR]A: Impossible to say. Im pretty sure that it will take quite a[CR]while, so dont hold your breath.[CR]----------[CR]6.[CR]Credits[CR]----------[CR]Phil - Hacker[CR]Keishou Omomuroni -[CR]Translation[CR]Squireforhire - Finding the lost files[CR]snesmaster40 -[CR]Repatch and FAQ</plot>

    <plot>Jutei Senki is a very simplistic strategy RPG, that doesn't bother with any[CR]kind of between-battle kind of story at all, short of the battle's title. Kind[CR]of refreshing, but the intro is just so cool! It really makes you wonder what[CR]the hell is going on, other than people just, you know, fighting each other.[CR]There's no real rules as far as unit type goes either; apart from their stats[CR](strength, defense, range, anti-air capability, etc.), a Toy is a Bobby is a[CR]Jaggy is a Rider, pretty much. So if you're looking for some kind of amazing[CR]Tactics Ogre this-beats-that-but-not-this game, this is not the one to look[CR]forward to. As soon as you click on a unit, its range lights up in a circle[CR]around it. You can move around anywhere in that circle, terrain and other[CR]units permitting. Which is cool. Once you attack an enemy, there's a wicked[CR]little battle animation that shows your unit attacking. Honestly, this is the[CR]highlight of the game. Those just plain rock. The hizzouse. As far as the rest[CR]of the graphics go, though... eh. They're just a bunch of tiny little icons,[CR]so what do you expect.[CR]Read Me:[CR]JUTEI SENKI[CR]ENGLISH TRANSLATION[CR]V1.00[CR]Copyright 2003 by Aeon[CR]Genesis[CR]http://agtp.romhack.net[CR]ToC[CR]1.About Jutei Senki[CR]2.Patch[CR]History[CR]3.Patch Credits and Contributors[CR]4.Known Issues With the[CR]Patch[CR]5.Application Instructions[CR]-------------------[CR]1.About Jutei[CR]Senki[CR]-------------------[CR]Jutei Senki is a fairly long and difficult[CR]strategy game,[CR]produced by Tam Tam and published by Enix.

If youre using[CR]a Mac, a Mac IPS patcher is[CR]available. Check the AGTP Links page. If youre[CR]using a copier, you[CR]probably already know how to patch the ROM :) Be sure[CR]to apply the[CR]patch to a clean copy of the ROM, and make sure your ROM[CR]HAS[CR]a header. If you right-click the ROM and select Properties,[CR]it[CR]should read "1.50 MB (1,573,376 bytes)". SNESTool can add headers[CR]for[CR]you easily, and you can find it at[CR]http://rpgd.emulationworld.com[CR]In the[CR]utilities section, click on the IPS Tools link.[CR]Your answers to the[CR]questions it prompts you with do not matter unless[CR]you plan on using a[CR]copier to play the game.[CR]Please note that there are two patches: one for[CR]the interleaved version[CR]of the game I first turned up, and one for the non-[CR]interleaved version[CR]of the game. Try jutei.ips first (this goes to the non-[CR]interleaved ROM)[CR]and if that doesnt work, try jutei-i.ips instead. If youre[CR]DOS-savvy,[CR]the SMC.COM program will tell you whether or not your ROM is[CR]interleaved.</plot>

    <plot>Natsume Kiroemon, the 45th leader of the Natsume family, is due to inherit the[CR]Koryu no Mimi, also known as the Golden Dragon Ring, which gives its bearer[CR]easy access to wealth and women. As a result of his father's death, he left[CR]the Italian monastery where he'd been training and rightfully took the name[CR]"Natsume Kiroemon" as well as the power of the Golden Dragon Ring. Upon his[CR]return to Japan, Kiroemon fell fatally in love with Kanako, one of the members[CR]of the rival Mina clan. However, the evil hand of the Mina clan attacked[CR]Kiroemon and then abducted Kanako. Now Kiroemon has unsealed the power of the[CR]Golden Dragon Ring, making his own power surge, and he's striking back at the[CR]Mina clan. Both Kiroemon and Kanako's fate are in your hands! Koryu no Mimi is[CR]a side-scrolling beat-em-up somewhat in the same vein as Final Fight. As Final[CR]Fight clones go, though, it seems pretty good. For one thing, the storyline is[CR]a lot more involved, with lots of different allies and villains running[CR]around. There are a lot of moves and combos you can pull off, and you also get[CR]plenty of weapons to wield, scenery to throw around, and so on. And if you can[CR]fill up your power meter, you briefly harness the power of the Golden Dragon[CR]Ring to become faster and much more powerful.

The Light Path,[CR]that is very straight through minus a choice of characters and the Imperial[CR]path.

    <plot>Laplace's Demon is a horror RPG with a Lovecraftian bent.

There was[CR]a very strong (and ill-[CR]conceived) push to get it out on[CR]Halloween back then, and the resultant[CR]patch was terribly[CR]buggy; battle menus didnt display right, status menus[CR]didnt[CR]display right, lots of item names had been chopped down to fit[CR]in[CR]available space, battle narrative didnt display in the[CR]correct order, and[CR]the writing was in desperate need of an edit.[CR]I eventually pulled the patch[CR]voluntarily, as it really did not[CR]meet my own quality standards. I[CR]continued to work on it on and[CR]off, fixing the combat narrative, expanding[CR]menus, and adding[CR]multi-line item names. I got some help with the font[CR]display[CR]issues and started work on the narrative myself, but[CR]eventually[CR]passed it off to Wes Falls, a developer who I follow on[CR]Twitter.[CR]Lots of issues kept cropping up during testing, several[CR]of[CR]which turned out to be in the original game. Its not very[CR]well put[CR]together, but we did the best we could with what we[CR]had.[CR]September 6,[CR]2018 - Initial version 2.00 Release[CR]October 31, 2001 - Initial version[CR]0.95B Release (retracted)[CR]---------------[CR]3.Patch[CR]Credits[CR]---------------[CR]THE LAPLACE TEAM[CR]Gideon Zhi - Project leader,[CR]lead romhacker, assembly work[CR]Tomato - Script translation[CR]TheMajinZenki[CR]- Translation checking[CR]Wes Falls - Script edit[CR]g8z et al - Fix for font[CR]hack[CR]--------------[CR]4.Known Issues[CR]--------------[CR]-- Somehow, you[CR]can end up with a "Nothing" item in your inventory.[CR] This can cause the[CR]Tools menu in combat to look weird. Sorting[CR] fixes it. Unsure whether this[CR]is a bug in the original game[CR] or not.[CR]-- Character names longer than[CR]six letters in slots 2 and 4 will[CR] occasionally overwrite the "HP"[CR]indicator of the characters[CR] in slots 3 and 5 when theyre targeted in[CR]combat. The HP[CR] indicator will reset when the next character or monster[CR]takes its turn.[CR]Please report any other bugs, spelling errors, and such[CR]on[CR]on The Pantheon (http://agtp.romhack.net/pantheon/)[CR]Screenshots are[CR]preferred, as are SRAM saves.[CR]--------------------------[CR]5.Application[CR]Instructions[CR]--------------------------[CR]Quick ROM Info:[CR]2.00 MB[CR](16mbit LoROM) WITHOUT header.

    <plot>Live A Live is an odd sort of game. At base, it's an RPG. What makes it[CR]different is it's separated into chapters. One has you playing as a cowboy,[CR]another as ninja, a third as martial arts master and his disciples. All the[CR]chapters are quite different. The ninja chapter, for instance, involves being[CR]a stealthy sneak and assissinating your rival without killing anyone else, or[CR]being a killing machine and cutting a swath through all the guards. The[CR]wrestler's chapter plays almost like a fighting game, as he faces off against[CR]his opponents one-on-one until he is the champ. All the characters join up at[CR]the end for the final chapter. I know, it sounds like Saga Frontier, but trust[CR]me, this game is actually good.[CR]Read[CR]Me:[CR]i&gt;&gt;?======================================================================[CR]SQUARES[CR]TRANSLATION[CR]======================================================================[CR]Live A Live Patch {v0.01}[CR] March 1st[CR]1999[CR]======================================================================[CR]*IMPORTANT*[CR]We ask you NOT to distribute the patch without this file, as it contains[CR]useful and required information concerning the project. [CR]Welcome to Squares[CR]Translations first official release of the Live A Live translation patch. Live[CR]A Live is a game produced by Squaresoft in September 1994. Unfortunatly, it[CR]never saw a release outside of Japan. It was also released in the shadow of[CR]Final Fantasy 3{6}, and therefore did not look impressive with its Final[CR]Fantasy 5 - type graphics. What the game really is is 8 mini-RPGs crammed on[CR]to one 16 meg cartridge. Each RPG carrys a different storyline and are set in[CR]different time periods. The only thing that remains the same in all 8 is the[CR]battle system. The ability to move around a square battle arena in turn-based[CR]style really revolutionised Square games to come. We have begun this[CR]translation so that people will realise the quality of the game, and it will[CR]not be forgotten.[CR]For the latest installement of the Live A Live[CR]translation patch, or that of Rudra no Hihou or Treasure Hunter G, visit[CR]Squares Translations home page at:[CR]http://www.pcpages.com/square[CR]======================================================================[CR]CONTENTS[CR]======================================================================[CR]1.[CR]Whats new?[CR]2.

They finally came up with Squares Translation, a group set[CR]out to tackle the very best of the untranslated Squaresoft RPGs. Dark Lich,[CR]assisted by his Japanese friend Kaze Yagami, are attempting a perfect script[CR]translation.

    <plot>This is the classic color-matching puzzle game, much like Puyo Puyo or Bust-A-[CR]Move if you've played those. Except this game is kind-of backwards.

    <plot>I think this game takes away Umihara Kawase's title as Cutest Game Ever.[CR]Although Rhapsody also comes close. Even after watching the opening story, the[CR]plot isn't really clear as to why this adorable little princess has to go and[CR]take down all these demons or what have you. But, you don't play these kind of[CR]games for their story. You're a princess. Who looks a lot like Little Red[CR]Riding Hood except you're, uh, Blue. And you're adorable. Anyways, your goal[CR]is to jump around and swing your sword at enemies, until there's no more[CR]enemies to swing your sword at. Basically. You also get powerups, that you can[CR]use with the A button, and you have your super badass attack, that you use[CR]with Select. But basically it's just your usual charming platformer that's[CR]really fun to play.

These twins have ESP powers but they try[CR]to hide this from their friends. Only Mr. Kageura knows their secret! In the[CR]game, the sisters and their friends are suddenly teleported to a strange and[CR]magical world. You must help them find their missing friends and defeat Majo-[CR]Majo's villains by throwing candy as your only weapon, and eventually find the[CR]way back home. (It's a platform game with two cute twins! How can you not love[CR]it?)</plot>

Its what[CR]Id consider to be a "lite" version of the[CR]events -- it covers, at its most[CR]extreme, the absolute major points and[CR]missions, but not much else. In that[CR]sense, its sort of "Gundam Lite"[CR]as it were. The characters are fairly flat[CR]and the story is extremely[CR]loose with details, and the fact that bosses are[CR]wimpy cowards and flee[CR]at the first sign of any damage (after which youre[CR]continually forced[CR]to go hunting for them) doesnt help the pacing any, but[CR]its not too[CR]bad of a game, and an interesting surprise awaits those who[CR]finish the[CR]main story arc.[CR]---------------[CR]2.Patch[CR]History[CR]---------------[CR]I honestly dont even remember when I started[CR]working on this one, only[CR]that it looked like an easy project at the time.[CR]Once the font width[CR]issue got worked out (and that took -ages-) it -was- an[CR]easy project,[CR]which is kinda nice I guess.

    <plot>Kidou Senshi V Gundam is an action game for the Super Nintendo. The game is[CR]based on a Japanese cartoon with the same title.[CR]Read Me:[CR]V[CR]Gundam[CR]English Patch[CR]Version 1.00 IPS[CR]Current Release: Apr. 29,[CR]2007[CR]Intial Release: Oct. 31, 2006[CR]by Twilight Translations[CR]copyright[CR]2006[CR]--------------------------------------[CR]1. Introduction[CR]2.[CR]Development[CR]3. Patch History[CR]4. Credits[CR]5.[CR]Acknowledgements[CR]--------------------------------------[CR]1.[CR]Introduction[CR]--------------------------------------[CR]V Gundam is an[CR]action game based on the anime series by the same name. It was released[CR]by[CR]Bandai in early 1994.[CR]As a game, it doesnt really stand up to[CR]criticism. The enemy AI is laughable, at best; [CR]the V Gundam controls like[CR]a brick; and your most effective weapon is also your weakest, so[CR]be ready[CR]to spend a lot of time hiding behind your shield firing your Vulcans at the[CR]enemy.[CR]Sadly, V Gundam, like nearly every other video game based on an[CR]anime, avoids going out of the[CR]way at all cost to explain to the player[CR]exactly what the hell is going on. In that sense,[CR]V Gundam should not be[CR]considered as a replacement to the series. If you play it after youve[CR]seen[CR]the series, however, you might enjoy it.[CR]Easily the thing that stands out[CR]the most about the game is the graphics. The majority of the[CR]graphics are[CR]very, very pretty, and, in the case of most of the cutscenes, breath taking.[CR]If[CR]only the developers had spent as much time on the core gameplay and[CR]design as they had on[CR]the[CR]graphics.[CR]--------------------------------------[CR]2.[CR]Development[CR]--------------------------------------[CR]After all this you[CR]might be wondering why I would even bother going through the trouble[CR]of[CR]hacking the game and finding a translator for it. Well, back when I[CR]first started, I thought[CR]about working on this game but didnt understand[CR]things well enough to do it at the time.[CR]In retrospect, this is a really[CR]simple, straight forward game to hack. Flash forward a couple[CR]years and I[CR]decided to take another whack at it and use it as a stepping stone for[CR]learning[CR]the ins and outs of the SNES. So during the summer of last year[CR](2005), I sat down and[CR]managed to shrink the font down from the 16x16 font[CR]used in the Japanese version to a more[CR]English friendly 8x16.[CR]Over the[CR]next couple of months, there were a couple of translators who signed on to[CR]help, but[CR]then disappeared. Then in March (of 2006), the clouds parted and[CR]the lights shined through.[CR]Suzaku (a fellow Gundam fan) signed on board and[CR]worked on translating the games script over[CR]the next 7 months or[CR]so.[CR]When he finally completed it earlier this month (October 06), he[CR]suggested the script could[CR]be a lot better if it werent for the space (on-[CR]screen; space in the ROM wasnt a problem)[CR]restrictions. I mentioned a[CR]variable width font would probably help and set out to implement[CR]one.[CR]Seeing as how it was the first (and probably the only stock ASM translation[CR]"tricks" I[CR]hadnt done), I didnt exactly know where to start. Luckily,[CR]Gideon Zhi of Aeon Genesis fame[CR]was kind enough to let me take a look at[CR]his source code for his Rudra patch, which was more[CR]than enough for me to[CR]figure out how to do it.[CR]With the VWF in, Suzaku and I sat down and stepped[CR]through every single string and meticulous[CR]revised the script. In some[CR]cases we were even forced to add filler to pad the text out to[CR]avoid having[CR]a string break amongst 6 word sentence. In the end, I feel that despite the[CR]"lite"[CR]nature of the games script, it is really worth reading.[CR]Some time[CR]during all of this, I approached Kitsune_Sniper of Vice Translations to design[CR]a[CR]title screen in the same vein as the official English title screen. Once[CR]he had the design[CR]finished, I asked Ryusui of Watercrown Productions[CR](*SYLVANIANS*), having seen how accurately[CR]he had reproduced the color[CR]scheme for his Sylvanian Families 4 translation, if he would care[CR]to take a[CR]whack at V Gundam. The end result is quite possibly my favorite title screen[CR]ever.[CR]If you have no other reason to play the game, play it just to see the[CR]title screen. Its[CR]that[CR]good.[CR]--------------------------------------[CR]3. Patch[CR]History[CR]--------------------------------------[CR]-Version 1.00 IPS[CR] The[CR]archive now includes the patch in both the NINJA format and the more common[CR]IPS format.[CR] If you choose to use the IPS patch, apply it to a headerless[CR]ROM. No changes have been made[CR] to the content of the patch.[CR]-Version[CR]1.00[CR] Everything is translated and thoroughly tested. That doesnt mean that[CR]there arent[CR] still bugs lurking around, just that we didnt find them. If[CR]you find any read[CR] drop me an email about it.[CR] The patch is in NINJA[CR]format, for information on this see the official site at:[CR]http://ninja.cinnamonpirate.com/[CR] Im actually very, very pleased with the[CR]patch. When I started working on it, I wasnt[CR] really excited about it, and[CR]now I want to tell everyone about it, despite the cardboard[CR] like[CR]gameplay.[CR]--------------------------------------[CR]4.[CR]Credits[CR]--------------------------------------[CR]V Gundam - The[CR]Game[CR]Translation Team:[CR]RedComet - Programmer (me)[CR]Suzaku -[CR]Translator[CR]Kitsune_Sniper - Title Design[CR]Ryusui - Title Color[CR]Scheme[CR]--------------------------------------[CR]5.[CR]Acknowledgements[CR]--------------------------------------[CR]I think I[CR]mentioned everyone who contributed to this project, but Id just like to[CR]thank[CR]everyone who did. This wouldnt be even half as good as it is without[CR]you.[CR]Ultimately, I hope you enjoy this patch. Check back with Twilight[CR]Translations for future[CR]releases! Cheers!</plot>

    <plot>Monstania is one of those kick-ass games that never got translated. I[CR]seriously don't see what the powers that be had against this game, except[CR]maybe it's short length. The graphics are impressive, the sound is great (with[CR]music by Lunar and Grandia god Noriyuki Iwadare), the story is pretty[CR]entertaining, and the gameplay is certainly there. Anyway, the game revolves[CR]around young Fron, who with the help of his sweetheart, Tia, is in search of[CR]the whereabouts of the thought-to-be-extinct fairies. You pretty much sit back[CR]and enjoy the story as it unfolds, until you encounter the enemy, where you[CR]fight them in a semi-realtime strategy environment (i.e., the monsters only[CR]attack while you move). In many ways, the battle system is somewhat similar to[CR]Azure Dream's battle system for PSX.[CR]Read Me:[CR]PROJECT[CR]MONSTANIA[CR]ENGLISH TRANSLATION V1.03[CR]Copyright 2000-2001 by Aeon Genesis[CR]and CTC[CR]http://agtp.romhack.net[CR]http://ctc.weyland-[CR]yutani.net[CR]http://www.ctc-lennus.org[CR]ToC[CR]1.About Monstania[CR]2.Patch[CR]History[CR]3.Patch Credits[CR]4.Known issues[CR]5.Application[CR]Instructions[CR]6.Mini-FAQ[CR]-----------------[CR]1.About[CR]Monstania[CR]-----------------[CR]Monstania is a strategy-RPG whose combat[CR]system plays much like old BBS[CR]door games like Rogue, Moria, or Nethack[CR](www.nethack.org). It was[CR]published in 1996 by Pack-In-Video. It is also a[CR]fairly short game,[CR]weighing in at about 6 hours if you take your time.

If you cant kill two Kobolds, you[CR]REALLY[CR]need help. So walk forward until youre next to the rock on the[CR]left,[CR]and wait until the kobold is a chess Knights fork away from[CR]you,[CR]between you and Tia. Then move forward a square, and start[CR]hacking[CR]away. Worst comes to worst, youll be at about 10 health after it[CR]dies.[CR]Keep in mind that this is absolute worst case! When it dies,[CR]another[CR]one shows up. At this point, go ahead and use your Recover skill[CR](it[CR]costs 5 points.) Then wait until the kobold is within the range[CR]of[CR]Frons sword, and start hacking away again. Congrats, you just won[CR]the[CR]first chapter. If you consulted this FAQ because you "just[CR]couldnt[CR]win!" then I suggest putting Monstania away and digging out[CR]Final[CR]Fantasy: Mystic Quest. At your level, it should take you about[CR]40[CR]hours. Now go play FF2 and 3, a little bit of Ogre Battle,[CR]Final[CR]Fantasy Tactics, and Tactics Ogre (maybe even Kartia) and THEN[CR]maybe[CR]youll see how easy Monstania really is.

Use Tias bow attack. If the slimes get too close (in[CR]other words,[CR]if theres one square between you and a slime, and it[CR]didnt move last turn)[CR]then move away from it.

You should be[CR]able to take them out one at a time,[CR]barring a large number of misses, etc.[CR]Heal when you need to. If you[CR]miss too many times, you may get[CR]tripleteamed. If that happens, youll[CR]probably lose, and will have to retry[CR]the whole thing. No biggie. Once[CR]Tia opens the door, move to the square in[CR]front of the door to end[CR]the battle.</plot>

    <plot>Mystic Ark is a universe of mysterious doors, a huge multi-scenario RPG by[CR]Enix, that story-wise is not connected to The 7th Saga. Although a few of its[CR]features and characters have been carried over from the preceeding game, any[CR]reference that depicts this work as The 7th Saga-II is erronious. If such[CR]localization nomenclature were to be followed, Mystic Ark would more[CR]appropriately be called The 8th Saga. Nevertheless, our English patch will[CR]leave this game as Mystic Ark. The tale centers around a single fighter who is[CR]captured by an unknown force, turned into a wooden Figurine, and whisked away[CR]to a spooky back chamber of a palace-like mansion that has only recently[CR]materialized on a desert island. When he or she is awakened by a eerie voice,[CR]the fighter encounters many other Figurines throughout the premises, some of[CR]which are fellow combatants who must be freed from this curse in order to be[CR]reanimated and fight at the hero's side. In searching for their homes,[CR]everyone must confront a number of powerful adversaries along the way that[CR]seem determined not to relinquish any of the seven Arks that not only harbor[CR]special powers, but hold the keys to opening new doors to other worlds. Hero[CR]Remeer or Heroine Ferris, whoever a player chooses to become at the start of[CR]gameplay - with an option to choose a new name up to 8-letters long - will[CR]explore the whole remote island chain and eight strange worlds before[CR]confronting the truth about the perpetrator that is turning almost everthing[CR]that exists into Figurines. For the most part, each world stands as a self-[CR]contained quest, much like the chapters of Dragon Quest-IV, and each new[CR]scenario appears stranger than the one that preceeded it. In the end, the hero[CR]must confront an unlikely villain in a situation that seems to defy[CR]rationality! Mystic Ark is not an average RPG. It plays old school, but it's[CR]much deeper than "A hero goes off to save the world" plot. The main character[CR]may have no defined background, but its safe to assume the author intended it[CR]that way. In literature, this phenomenon is called the "everyman character"[CR]which means Remeer could be any male, Ferris could be any female. The desired[CR]effect is to have a player assume the main character's role. Each world in[CR]Mystic Ark is so varied, a player winds up learning new concepts and growing[CR]in character, Of course, this happens to the main character in the game as[CR]well, as the story inveigles us to ponder our own virtues and ask questions[CR]such as, "Who are we? Do we have what it takes to be truly good people? Just[CR]how much does our own darkness rule us? Are we ready to change our world for[CR]the better?"

If you are using ZSNES to play[CR]this game, then you[CR]can simply place the IPS file in the same directory as[CR]your save files,[CR]and ZSNES will automatically read the patch and apply it,[CR]without[CR]changing your original ROM. If you are using another emulator, you[CR]will[CR]have to patch the game manually. IPS.exe and Snestool are two[CR]common[CR]programs that can do this, and they can be found at most emulation[CR]and[CR]translation websites. Before patching your ROM, *always* make sure[CR]you[CR]keep a backup copy.[CR]To use IPS.exe, type this at a command[CR]prompt:[CR]IPS  [CR]where  is the name and location of the ROM to be patched,[CR]and[CR] is the name and location of the IPS file to be used.[CR]Snestool has a[CR]graphic interface and doesnt require command line[CR]arguments. After loading[CR]it, select the "Use IPS" option. Then find the[CR]IPS file in the browser[CR]window to the left and select it. After that,[CR]select the ROM that the IPS[CR]should be applied[CR]to.[CR]============[CR]Instructions[CR]============[CR]Directional Pad = Move[CR]left or right[CR]A button = Energy shot (consumes one orb)[CR]B button =[CR]Jump[CR]Y button = Punch[CR]L button = Slide left[CR]R button = Slide[CR]right[CR]Down + Y = Leg Sweep[CR]B + Y = Jump Kick[CR](L,R) + Y = Rising[CR]Kick[CR]B + (L,R) = Diving Kick[CR]When you start a new game, you have access[CR]to the lower three islands,[CR]and the first stage of the main island. The[CR]first island in the bottom[CR]left only represents Papuwa Island, and has no[CR]importance to the actual[CR]gameplay.[CR]The second island is used to create[CR]and input passwords. Passwords[CR]consist of a sequence of three portraits.[CR]The leftmost option will exit[CR]the password screen. By highlighting a[CR]portrait and pushing up or down,[CR]you can cycle through all of them. The[CR]rightmost option will attempt to[CR]enter in the password. Note that passwords[CR]will not save your orb[CR]count, life meter, experience level or amount of[CR]lives. It only counts[CR]how many stages have been completed.[CR]The third[CR]island allows you to change the sound settings. The first[CR]option is for[CR]Stereo sound, and the second one is for Monaural sound.[CR]While playing, you[CR]might encounter blocks that flash an icon when[CR]broken. These are powerups[CR]that Shintaro can use.[CR]Orb = Increases orb count by one[CR]Various food =[CR]Slightly refills your life meter[CR]Fish-head = Completely refills your life[CR]meter[CR]Mini-Shintaro = Extra life[CR]Heart = Added to your heart meter /[CR]When you collect four, you gain an[CR] extra level of life[CR]When you defeat[CR]an enemy, you gain experience points, which are needed[CR]to increase[CR]Shintaros level of power. The maximum level of experience[CR]is[CR]five.[CR]=================[CR]Running the Game.[CR]=================[CR]The[CR]best medium would be a real S-NES (via back-up unit). [CR]There is a problem[CR]that occurs with a few S-NES emulators and the [CR]1/2 Colour Subtract effect[CR]used in this game for the text window [CR]shading. The only emulator we are[CR]aware of to emulate this correctly[CR]is an old version of snes9x DOS. You can[CR]see the correct window shading[CR]in the screenshots on FHs Papuwa[CR]page.[CR]==========[CR]Disclaimer[CR]==========[CR]"Nanboku Shounen Papuwa-[CR]kun" is (c)1994 by Enix of Japan.[CR]This work is unofficial and is not[CR]supported by them.[CR]This patch may be freely distributed, as long as:[CR] -[CR]The patch remains unmodified (including "retranslations")[CR] - This readme[CR]file accompanies the patch.[CR] - The ROM image is not distributed with this[CR]patch already applied.[CR]This patch is not for sale, and is not to be[CR]exchanged for money,[CR]goods, or services of any kind.</plot>

    <plot>How to explain this game ... hmm ... AH! Panic in Nakayoshi World is a lot[CR]like The Adventures of Lolo (for Nes). You walk around in a single-screen room[CR]that has an overhead-view. Kinda like Lolo. However, there's no real puzzles[CR]involved, and you don't have a limited number of shots with which to kill[CR]stuff, so that little "which enemy do I kill?" strategy element is kind of ...[CR]non-existant. Unfortunately, those elements are what made Adventures of Lolo a[CR]great game, and the lack thereof is what makes this game crappy. Oh yeah, and[CR]Sailormoon is in it too. So I suppose that makes it that much worse. So...[CR]maybe it's not a lot like Lolo. What the game boils down to is this: you're[CR]one of four characters from various animes. You have to save the world. Saving[CR]the world involves going through various rooms. To advance to the next room,[CR]you have to kill enough monsters (may not make sense in real life, but this[CR]makes perfect sense in the world of video game logic). After six levels of[CR]this, you fight a boss. Then, the scenery changes, I suppose to "break the[CR]monotony". The game probably ends eventually, with a silly anime cut scene[CR]where Sailormoon probably steals the show from the worthwhile characters. For[CR]me, it ended an hour after I started playing it, right after I exited out of[CR]ZSNES. Anyway, if this type of game is your cup of tea, try it[CR]out.[CR]Read Me:[CR]PANIC IN NAKAYOSHI WORLD[CR]English Translation Patch[CR]version 1.00[CR]There should be three files included in the distribution ZIP[CR]file:[CR] NAKAYOSI.IPS -- the English translation patch[CR] NAKAYOSI.TXT --[CR]the English instruction manual[CR] README.TXT -- this text file[CR]You may[CR]distribute the packaged ZIP file as long as it is in no way modified[CR]or[CR]sold for profit. It is not our game; weve only translated it. Therefore[CR]we[CR]cannot accept profits or let anyone else do so. If you catch anyone[CR]else[CR]violating these terms, let us know at the website address[CR]below.[CR]From the team at "Project: Sailor Moon" (PSM), thanks for[CR]downloading this[CR]patch! There are two ways to use it:[CR]1. Use a patch-[CR]application program ("IPS-WIN", etc.) to apply the patch file[CR] to the game[CR]file. (Make a backup of the game file first!)[CR]2. If you use ZSNES, just put[CR]the patch file in the same directory as the[CR] game file and ZSNES will[CR]automatically patch the game in RAM when the[CR] game starts, leaving both[CR]files intact.[CR]Because this was our first translation, and because technical[CR]constraints[CR]kept us from saying everything thats going on in the game, weve[CR]decided to[CR]write an English instruction manual from scratch to explain it a[CR]bit better.[CR]Enjoy, and thanks again! :)[CR]The Melody Maker, PSM[CR]Translation Department[CR]http://projectsm.cjb.net/</plot>

    <plot>Yep, it's a Sailor Moon RPG. Pretty nifty, huh? The game is pretty standard I[CR]guess; there are some pretty cool things in it though, like the nifty[CR]techniques and stuff. However, it is pretty hard to make sense of things[CR](especially in the beginning) without a good knowledge of the series; the game[CR]continues the unfortunate "You'd damn well better know who everyone is before[CR]you play, cause no way in hell are we going to explain it to you" syndrome of[CR]anime gaming. Of course, this game isn't meant for just your average Joe guy,[CR]it's meant for people who like Sailor Moon.

It was one of[CR] many[CR]console games developed for the SNES and gameboy during that[CR] time period[CR]based on the popular Manga and Anime show, "Sailor Moon".[CR] The majority of[CR]these games tend to be puzzle games, fighter games,[CR] and so forth. SMRPG is[CR]distinctive however, in that it currently[CR] remains the only console Sailor[CR]Moon game in the RPG category to have[CR] been developed and released[CR]commercially.[CR] Unfortunately, none of these Sailor Moon games, including[CR]the RPG,[CR] ever saw a commercial North American release. And given the[CR]fact[CR] that the 16 bit era of gaming is fast becoming nothing more than[CR]a[CR] distant memory in the wake of yet a second wave of next generation[CR]systems, its doubtful that they ever will.[CR] This left only the fan and[CR]emulation community. In 1997, Cecil began[CR] the initial effort of trying to[CR]bring about a translation patch of the[CR] game, and Bishoujo Senshi[CR]Translations (BST) was born. He was soon[CR] joined by several others[CR]interested in the same goal (translator[CR] Moose among them), and it wasnt[CR]long till a script dump was obtained[CR] with Artemios help, allowing the[CR]translation to get underway.[CR] But as is often the case with SNES RPG[CR]projects, the ROM would not[CR] give up all its secrets so easily. The menu[CR]fonts, along with much[CR] of the menu text itself, were compressed beyond[CR]recognition. Also[CR] the game code was designed only for a 16x16 fixed width[CR]font for the[CR] main story text, making english text look rather large and[CR]unsightly.[CR] The absence of progress on the ROM modifications combined[CR]with[CR] the lack of time by several key people gradually caused BST to[CR]become[CR] nearly comatose. Just about everyone in the initial group[CR]slowly[CR] dropped out of sight. As 1998 wore on, a few other small[CR]attempts[CR] were made by separate projects that tried to create their own[CR]SMRPG[CR] translation patches. But they eventually failed as well.....[CR]Sometime during the summer of 1998, FuSoYa appeared for the first[CR] time and[CR]contacted Cecil with information dealing with the ROMs[CR] compression scheme.[CR]In turn, Cecil got back in contact with Moose.[CR] Within a few months, they[CR]would form the core of the restarted[CR] attempt to make the SMRPG translation[CR]a reality. Cecil continued to[CR] handle the webpage, while Moose diligently[CR]translated material and[CR] FuSoYa took over the ROM modifications by starting[CR]the patch over[CR] from scratch. By the Christmas of 98, the compression had[CR]been[CR] long defeated, the menus modified, the ROM expanded, a newly[CR]created[CR] VWF ASM code modification implemented, and the translation was[CR]on[CR] its way.[CR] The work continued on well into 1999. FuSoYa continued to[CR]refine the[CR] patch, creating tools to add in translated signs, intro[CR]credits, etc,[CR] as Moose finished the lists and kept working away at the[CR]scripts.[CR] In July, Lina`chan (who had recently finished with SD3) joined[CR]Moose[CR] in translating the last of the Japanese material. With the twos[CR]combined efforts, the translation was quickly completed in August,[CR] and[CR]testing by Kisai went underway.[CR] And on Mercurys birthday of September[CR]10th, 1999...the finished SNES[CR] SMRPG translation patch was released to the[CR]public.[CR]______________________________________________________________________[CR]3.

Translation notes from[CR]Moose[CR]______________________________________________________________________[CR]This translation has tried to stay as faithful as possible to the[CR] original[CR]Japanese. Therefore, name suffixes and the original[CR] Japanese names (eg[CR]Mizuno-san) have been left in, and not changed to[CR] the DiC names. For the[CR]uninitiated, a name conversion table has been[CR] included in the liner notes.[CR]I recommend everyone reads the liner[CR] notes, even people who have seen the[CR]original anime, cause the game[CR] does include some elements from the manga[CR]whichll confuse the hell[CR] out of you if you dont know whats going on.[CR](Although, if you read[CR] the manga too, thats ok ^_^)[CR] Oh yeah, a[CR]warning: Cause the original series was a lot more mature[CR] than the DiC dub,[CR]this game consequentially does contain some more[CR] mature themes (death,[CR]love, yadayadayada).[CR] Be warned[CR]:).[CR]______________________________________________________________________[CR]5. Personal[CR]Comments[CR]______________________________________________________________________[CR]A. Lina`chan[CR] Yay! Another part for me on a readme! Well first of all[CR]Sailor[CR] Moon is one of my favorite anime! If not my favorite one! ^^ So[CR]I decided to give my friends of BST a little hand with the[CR] translation,[CR]and as you can see weve come out with a full[CR] translation! I hope you all[CR]enjoy this Sailor Moon game as much[CR] as we enjoyed working on it. Big hugs[CR]to all my friends![CR] Oh! And you Sailor Moon fans! If you are into[CR]Internet[CR] text-based role playing games. Come visit Bishoujo Senshi[CR]Muck![CR]http://members.spree.com/glaive/muck/bishoujosenshi/bishoujosenshi.html[CR] Or[CR]telnet to telnet://tnt.maison-otaku.net:1492[CR] We will be waiting for you![CR]^_^[CR] B. Moose[CR] Hmm. I really dont have anything to say. Funny that, I[CR]usually[CR] cant shut up :P.[CR] C. Cecil[CR] When I first began this project[CR]waay back in early 97 or so, I[CR] wasnt quite sure at the time if itd ever[CR]get finished. At[CR] the time, I was the only person I knew working on it, and[CR]the[CR] current well-known players of the ROM scene werent exactly[CR] eager[CR]to have more people hopping around dipping their hand[CR] into the rom-hacking[CR]cookie jar (Som2Freak, you should be more[CR] polite to beginning translators[CR]:D). It was just me, my hex[CR] editor, and a big sheet of graph paper I wrote[CR]the hex codes[CR] to all the japanese characters on. Fortunately, however,[CR]word[CR] spread of the project and people flocked to my horrible[CR] Geocities[CR]page and offered to help. Unfortunately, though,[CR] real-life time[CR]constraints being what they were, I eventually[CR] just took the backseat to[CR]keep the website alive while our[CR] expert coder FuSoYa and our translators[CR]hurried the project[CR] along to its goal. But luckily it has all finally[CR]come[CR] together, and we can all proudly present you with the[CR] completely[CR]translated Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon: Another[CR] Story.[CR] Curiously[CR]enough, I dont think any of the original group is[CR] still with us now at the[CR]end, but Id like to thank EVERYONE[CR] that helped in any possible way,[CR]especially the current project[CR] members and everyone already listed in this[CR]text file (without[CR] whom this wouldnt have been possible!), and of course[CR]Artemio[CR] Urbina for his help in developing some initial code to dump[CR]scripts, etc, which made our job a lot easier. Special thanks[CR] as well to[CR]Newton Tron for helping to keep the project and its[CR] members coordinated in[CR]the early stages. Id also like to offer[CR] my acknowledgements for the[CR]literally hundreds, if not thousands[CR] of people who emailed offering[CR]support or kind words, and to let[CR] all the patient, polite folks out there[CR]know theyre finally[CR] getting what theyve been waiting for. Thank you![CR]D. FuSoYa[CR] Id just like to personally thank Moose for his long hours of[CR]translation work, Lina`chan for graciously aiding us in getting[CR] past that[CR]last translation mile, and Cecil for keeping the page[CR] alive for so long.[CR]Id also like to thank alt.fan.sailor-moons[CR] own Kisai for beta testing the[CR]patch over the past few weeks[CR] for me. And thanks to TheGun for sending me[CR]that snes9x tracer[CR] a while back, as well as to anyone else involved in[CR]creating[CR] some of the tools Ive used at one point or another (ZSNES[CR]debugger, Yoshis disassembler, Jeremy Gordons 65816 assembler,[CR] Naga,[CR]Borlands C++ 5.02 package).[CR] And for putting up with all our ramblings,[CR]heres a small boon[CR] for anyone thats playing through the game a second time[CR]now[CR] that its in english but doesnt want to waste time for a few[CR]initial levels. When the Sailor Moon title screen shows up,[CR] hold down X[CR]and press start. You should hear a confirmation[CR] chime and be taken to the[CR]load menu. Start a new game, and the[CR] senshi will now begin at level 16[CR]instead of level 1. Enjoy![CR] And since someone will likely ask this anyway:[CR]yes, that was[CR] there in the original game, and no you dont really have to[CR]wait[CR] for your second time through... assuming you dont mind cheating[CR]your first time through a game meant for little girls. :P[CR] Ack! No wait, I[CR]didnt mean to imply...!!![CR] ::FuSoYa is carried off by a band of angry[CR]female gamers and SM[CR] fans, never to be heard from again::[CR]______________________________________________________________________[CR]6.

With the twos[CR]combined efforts, the translation was quickly completed in August,[CR] and[CR]testing by Kisai went underway.[CR] And on Mercurys birthday of September[CR]10th, 1999...the finished SNES[CR] SMRPG translation patch was released to the[CR]public.[CR]______________________________________________________________________[CR]3.

Therefore, name suffixes and the original[CR] Japanese names (eg[CR]Mizuno-san) have been left in, and not changed to[CR] the DiC names. For the[CR]uninitiated, a name conversion table has been[CR] included in the liner notes.[CR]I recommend everyone reads the liner[CR] notes, even people who have seen the[CR]original anime, cause the game[CR] does include some elements from the manga[CR]whichll confuse the hell[CR] out of you if you dont know whats going on.[CR](Although, if you read[CR] the manga too, thats ok ^_^)[CR] Oh yeah, a[CR]warning: Cause the original series was a lot more mature[CR] than the DiC dub,[CR]this game consequentially does contain some more[CR] mature themes (death,[CR]love, yadayadayada).[CR] Be warned[CR]:).[CR]______________________________________________________________________[CR]5. Personal[CR]Comments[CR]______________________________________________________________________[CR]A. Lina`chan[CR] Yay! Another part for me on a readme! Well first of all[CR]Sailor[CR] Moon is one of my favorite anime! If not my favorite one! ^^ So[CR]I decided to give my friends of BST a little hand with the[CR] translation,[CR]and as you can see weve come out with a full[CR] translation! I hope you all[CR]enjoy this Sailor Moon game as much[CR] as we enjoyed working on it. Big hugs[CR]to all my friends![CR] Oh! And you Sailor Moon fans! If you are into[CR]Internet[CR] text-based role playing games. Come visit Bishoujo Senshi[CR]Muck![CR]http://members.spree.com/glaive/muck/bishoujosenshi/bishoujosenshi.html[CR] Or[CR]telnet to telnet://tnt.maison-otaku.net:1492[CR] We will be waiting for you![CR]^_^[CR] B. Moose[CR] Hmm. I really dont have anything to say. Funny that, I[CR]usually[CR] cant shut up :P.[CR] C. Cecil[CR] When I first began this project[CR]waay back in early 97 or so, I[CR] wasnt quite sure at the time if itd ever[CR]get finished. At[CR] the time, I was the only person I knew working on it, and[CR]the[CR] current well-known players of the ROM scene werent exactly[CR] eager[CR]to have more people hopping around dipping their hand[CR] into the rom-hacking[CR]cookie jar (Som2Freak, you should be more[CR] polite to beginning translators[CR]:D). It was just me, my hex[CR] editor, and a big sheet of graph paper I wrote[CR]the hex codes[CR] to all the japanese characters on. Fortunately, however,[CR]word[CR] spread of the project and people flocked to my horrible[CR] Geocities[CR]page and offered to help. Unfortunately, though,[CR] real-life time[CR]constraints being what they were, I eventually[CR] just took the backseat to[CR]keep the website alive while our[CR] expert coder FuSoYa and our translators[CR]hurried the project[CR] along to its goal. But luckily it has all finally[CR]come[CR] together, and we can all proudly present you with the[CR] completely[CR]translated Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon: Another[CR] Story.[CR] Curiously[CR]enough, I dont think any of the original group is[CR] still with us now at the[CR]end, but Id like to thank EVERYONE[CR] that helped in any possible way,[CR]especially the current project[CR] members and everyone already listed in this[CR]text file (without[CR] whom this wouldnt have been possible!), and of course[CR]Artemio[CR] Urbina for his help in developing some initial code to dump[CR]scripts, etc, which made our job a lot easier. Special thanks[CR] as well to[CR]Newton Tron for helping to keep the project and its[CR] members coordinated in[CR]the early stages. Id also like to offer[CR] my acknowledgements for the[CR]literally hundreds, if not thousands[CR] of people who emailed offering[CR]support or kind words, and to let[CR] all the patient, polite folks out there[CR]know theyre finally[CR] getting what theyve been waiting for. Thank you![CR]D. FuSoYa[CR] Id just like to personally thank Moose for his long hours of[CR]translation work, Lina`chan for graciously aiding us in getting[CR] past that[CR]last translation mile, and Cecil for keeping the page[CR] alive for so long.[CR]Id also like to thank alt.fan.sailor-moons[CR] own Kisai for beta testing the[CR]patch over the past few weeks[CR] for me. And thanks to TheGun for sending me[CR]that snes9x tracer[CR] a while back, as well as to anyone else involved in[CR]creating[CR] some of the tools Ive used at one point or another (ZSNES[CR]debugger, Yoshis disassembler, Jeremy Gordons 65816 assembler,[CR] Naga,[CR]Borlands C++ 5.02 package).[CR] And for putting up with all our ramblings,[CR]heres a small boon[CR] for anyone thats playing through the game a second time[CR]now[CR] that its in english but doesnt want to waste time for a few[CR]initial levels. When the Sailor Moon title screen shows up,[CR] hold down X[CR]and press start. You should hear a confirmation[CR] chime and be taken to the[CR]load menu. Start a new game, and the[CR] senshi will now begin at level 16[CR]instead of level 1. Enjoy![CR] And since someone will likely ask this anyway:[CR]yes, that was[CR] there in the original game, and no you dont really have to[CR]wait[CR] for your second time through... assuming you dont mind cheating[CR]your first time through a game meant for little girls. :P[CR] Ack!

    <plot>Radical Dreamers is a visual novel set in the Chrono Trigger universe. It is a[CR]pseudo-sequel to Chrono Trigger itself, and is commonly referred to as the[CR]game that inspired Chrono Cross. This is true to a very great extent, but if[CR]you're expecting Chrono Cross on the SNES or anything even vaguely similar to[CR]it, then you're going to be sorely disappointed. RD plays very much like a[CR]Choose Your Own Adventure novel. Text is displayed for a while, and eventually[CR]you will be prompted to make a choice based on the text. You navigate the[CR]mansion that way, you fight battles that way, and in fact, you do everything[CR]that way. At the core of any novel - whether it's pushed as a paperback or[CR]hardcover book, a PDF file on some website, or a game like this one - is its[CR]story and its writing.[CR]Read Me:[CR].,g8$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$"""""$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$8g,.

Dreamer_Nom for figuring out[CR]how the in-game saves work ,d$b.[CR]$$ and passing the data onto Radical R.

This thing took forever!$!@#$ I swear Ive put in more[CR],d$b.[CR]` $$ time into translating this than like all my other $$ [CR] qb[CR]translation projects combined! Sheesh! Ive heard about `qb [CR],d$b. some guy[CR]once who translated Star Ocean in a week or ,d$b.[CR]$$ something like that,[CR]but let me tell you, there isnt ` $$[CR]`qb anybody, anywhere, who could get[CR]through this thing in a qb[CR],d$b. week. Yeah, I know, I should have been[CR]busy making money ,d$b.[CR]` $$ or living life up or getting laid or[CR]something, but $$ [CR] qb someone had to translate this game, and nobody was[CR]really `qb [CR],d$b. stepping up to the plate, so I figured what the hell.[CR],d$b.[CR]$$ ` $$[CR]`qb I think I started on it back around two and a half[CR]years qb[CR],d$b. ago years ago (late 2000), when I found somewhere a font[CR],d$b.[CR]` $$ Disnesquick had ripped out of the ROM. I asked around if $$ [CR]qb anybody wanted to tackle the game, but all the good guys `qb [CR],d$b. were[CR]already busy with their own projects. My old friend ,d$b.[CR]$$ Darkforce gave[CR]a little help, however - after a quick ` $$[CR]`qb trace, he told me where the[CR]script was located in the qb[CR],d$b. ROM. Thats all I needed to start getting[CR]myself more and ,d$b.[CR]` $$ more entangled in this mess of a project. Over[CR]the next $$ [CR] qb few months, I would learn about the evils of LZ `qb[CR],d$b. compression, and the mysterious ways of script encoding a[CR],d$b.[CR]$$ la Squaresoft. Eventually, after Id gained the help of ` $$[CR]`qb[CR]some guys who helped me understand the games compression qb[CR],d$b. method,[CR]we made tools to decompress the script, but could ,d$b.[CR]` $$ never get it[CR]quite right... It was always a little bit $$ [CR] qb off. Unfortunately, when[CR]you try and try something day `qb [CR],d$b. after day but nothing ever[CR]happens, you start to lose ,d$b.[CR]$$ interest. ` $$[CR]`qb qb[CR],d$b. The[CR]project just sat there, stalled on my computer, for ,d$b.[CR]` $$ months.[CR]Maybe even a year... who knows. To tell you the $$ [CR] qb truth, I was really[CR]busy with my final year of college at `qb [CR],d$b. the time, and on top of[CR]that I was doing crew (rowing) ,d$b.[CR]$$ with Ohio State, so anything like[CR]this was unfortunately ` $$[CR]`qb low priority for a long while. But then,[CR]one day (were qb[CR],d$b. now up to around March 2002 I think), this guy Id[CR]been ,d$b.[CR]` $$ working with named Nick Burtner suggested something new -[CR]$$ [CR] qb forget decompressing the script, because the game itself `qb[CR],d$b. decompresses it into memory when it starts, and we should[CR],d$b.[CR]$$ theoretically be able to find it in RAM. So, I checked ` $$[CR]`qb[CR]the in-game memory, and there it was! on May 30, after a qb[CR],d$b. custom[CR]version of ZSNES was made for me by _Demo_, I ,d$b.[CR]` $$ procured the[CR]decompressed script from memory and we $$ [CR] qb finally had a complete[CR]script in our hands, ready for `qb [CR],d$b. translation. ,d$b.[CR]$$ `[CR]$$[CR]`qb By June, I had refined and readied the script decoder (a qb[CR],d$b.[CR]program that takes the script in the games own format ,d$b.[CR]` $$ and turns[CR]it into a readable, editable textfile) and $$ [CR] qb reencoder (for the[CR]reverse). I had to learn 65816 `qb [CR],d$b. assembly in July when noone came[CR]to my call for help with ,d$b.[CR]$$ some low-level coding issues, but I didnt[CR]run into ` $$[CR]`qb anything too difficult. Id really like to mention Gideon[CR]qb[CR],d$b. Zhi here; his DMA textfile was my biggest help in getting[CR],d$b.[CR]` $$ off the ground with learning SNES assembly. If more of $$ [CR]qb the experienced translating community was to start making `qb [CR],d$b.[CR]tutorials as assible as his, I know it would help out the ,d$b.[CR]$$ learning[CR]curve in the scene immensely. Anyhow, within ` $$[CR]`qb about two weeks, I[CR]had a new font system in place, and qb[CR],d$b. managed to make it so that the[CR]script didnt even need to ,d$b.[CR]` $$ be recompressed when being reinserted[CR]back into the ROM. $$ [CR] qb I really lucked out, being able to avoid all the[CR]`qb [CR],d$b. compression issues completely. ,d$b.[CR]$$ ` $$[CR]`qb By this[CR]time, the translating was finally getting under qb[CR],d$b. way, which was a[CR]heap of work in its own right. I would ,d$b.[CR]` $$ have liked to have more[CR]translators help me on it, but I $$ [CR] qb suppose it was fate that decreed[CR]that it would be my `qb [CR],d$b. Japanese skills which would gain all those[CR]thousands of ,d$b.[CR]$$ hours of translating practice. Muahahaha. ` $$[CR]`qb[CR]qb[CR],d$b. In a lure to attract more and more people to my cause ,d$b.[CR]`[CR]$$ and hopefully hire a translator or two, I released a $$ [CR] qb preemptive[CR]"teaser" patch on August 17th, 2002 with the `qb [CR],d$b. first ten or so[CR]minutes of the game translated. Actually ,d$b.[CR]$$ it was pretty much just[CR]begging for help, but hey, what ` $$[CR]`qb are you gonna do. Anyhow, it was[CR]only then that I started qb[CR],d$b. to receive some serious offers for[CR]translation ,d$b.[CR]` $$ assistance. Dont get me wrong, I would get emails[CR]from $$ [CR] qb potential translators all the time, but very few were `qb[CR],d$b. actually willing to sit down for more than a week and ,d$b.[CR]$$[CR]tackle any significant amount of text - the script is ` $$[CR]`qb about 700[CR]pages, which I can admit is somewhat qb[CR],d$b. intimidating. The best guy[CR]who approached me is now a ,d$b.[CR]` $$ good friend of mine, who goes by the[CR]nickname MO. He $$ [CR] qb managed to translate and edit about 150 pages for[CR]me `qb [CR],d$b. while his girlfriend was over in Europe and needed[CR],d$b.[CR]$$ something to keep his mind off things, which I can ` $$[CR]`qb[CR]understand completely. qb[CR],d$b. ,d$b.[CR]` $$ But, the majority of the[CR]translation fell on my $$ [CR] qb shoulders. I have a BA in Japanese, and Ive[CR]spent three `qb [CR],d$b. or so months in Japan a couple of years ago, but I[CR],d$b.[CR]$$ wouldnt exactly call myself fluent. I relied heavily on `[CR]$$[CR]`qb dictionaries such as EDICT (supplied with JWPce, the qb[CR],d$b.[CR]Japanese text editor I used for Radical Dreamers) and ,d$b.[CR]` $$ Japans Goo[CR]online dictionary. However, these left me $$ [CR] qb hanging sometimes, and[CR]occasionally I would hit a tough `qb [CR],d$b. spot in the translation. When[CR]this happened, we would ,d$b.[CR]$$ discuss them on MOs wwwboard (a great[CR]place for ` $$[CR]`qb translators to hang out, see link at the bottom) and try[CR]qb[CR],d$b. to figure out the best possible way to convey what we ,d$b.[CR]`[CR]$$ thought was being said. $$ [CR] qb `qb [CR],d$b. In the end, it all worked[CR]out fine, Id say. Im much ,d$b.[CR]$$ better with Japanese now than Ive ever[CR]been before ` $$[CR]`qb thanks to all this. I translated the scripts final[CR]qb[CR],d$b. Japanese sentence on the chilly afternoon of March 12th,[CR],d$b.[CR]` $$ 2003. From there, only a few more bits remained to be $$ [CR] qb[CR]edited. Once that was out of the way, private beta `qb [CR],d$b. testing began[CR]on March 27th, and soon after that I ,d$b.[CR]$$ decided to publically release[CR]the translation on April ` $$[CR]`qb 15th for my mothers birthday. qb[CR],d$b.[CR],d$b.[CR]` $$ Were probably gonna get some heat for this translation, $$ [CR]qb because its not really word for word, like some people `qb [CR],d$b. want.[CR]Wordings were changed to make things flow better, ,d$b.[CR]$$ and cultural[CR]"in-jokes" were altered to be funny for ` $$[CR]`qb English speakers. However,[CR]things like character qb[CR],d$b. progression, plot structure, and narrative[CR]style were all ,d$b.[CR]` $$ left untouched so that the game retained as much[CR]of its $$ [CR] qb original feel as possible. `qb [CR],d$b. ,d$b.[CR]$$ We kept[CR]more in line with the English versions of names ` $$[CR]`qb as they appear in[CR]the American versions of Chrono Trigger qb[CR],d$b. and Chrono Cross, instead[CR]of retaining the Japanese ,d$b.[CR]` $$ naming conventions.

At the same time, he doesnt BS you ,d$b.[CR]` $$ at all and tells you[CR]exactly where things stand. I also $$ [CR] qb got to know him a lot better[CR]during the process, which `qb [CR],d$b. was nice.

This whole game was quite fun to work on, I ,d$b.[CR]` $$[CR]think...although I helped with the translation, the $$ [CR] qb writing is all[CR]Demi...I think hes a terrific writer and `qb [CR],d$b. what youre reading is[CR]basically all him. ,d$b.[CR]$$ ` $$[CR]`qb Id also like to thank all of our[CR]beta testers, akujin, qb[CR],d$b.

GAME INFO:[CR],d$b.[CR]` $$ $$ [CR] qb Radical Dreamers is a side-story to Demis favorite[CR]`qb [CR],d$b. game, Chrono Trigger. It was released in 1996 by ,d$b.[CR]$$[CR]Squaresoft through this thing called the Satellaview, ` $$[CR]`qb Nintendos[CR]Japanese-only competitor for the Sega Channel. qb[CR],d$b. It was this thing[CR]that fit onto the top of your SNES and ,d$b.[CR]` $$ let you download games[CR]through the phone line. RD was a $$ [CR] qb game released exclusively through[CR]this system for a short `qb [CR],d$b. while, so it remained relatively of[CR]unheard of until ,d$b.[CR]$$ recently. ` $$[CR]`qb qb[CR],d$b. Radical[CR]Dreamers is a storybook game. I dont think ,d$b.[CR]` $$ Americans have really[CR]seen this type of game before, but $$ [CR] qb theyre common in Japan, I think.[CR]Theyre sort of like `qb [CR],d$b. Text Adventures (like the old Zork games)[CR]but theyre ,d$b.[CR]$$ driven by menus instead of text input. You could[CR]compare ` $$[CR]`qb them to computerised "Choose Your Own Adventure" books.[CR]qb[CR],d$b. These games are 100% reading, so if youre not a big ,d$b.[CR]` $$[CR]reader, chances are you wont be having much fun here. $$ [CR] qb But hey,[CR]youre probably here because Radical Dreamers `qb [CR],d$b. has ties to the[CR]Chrono games, not because its a great ,d$b.[CR]$$ game on its own, so what the[CR]hell. ` $$[CR]`qb qb[CR],d$b. Radical Dreamers is really not like Chrono[CR]Trigger or ,d$b.[CR]` $$ Chrono Cross at all in the sense that its not an RPG,[CR]$$ [CR] qb but it does seem to take place in the Chrono universe. It `qb[CR],d$b. features characters from Chrono Cross and Chrono Trigger,[CR],d$b.[CR]$$ and places like Viper Manor and Porre are integral to the `[CR]$$[CR]`qb plot. qb[CR],d$b. ,d$b.[CR]` $$ They say Radical Dreamers was[CR]somewhat remade into $$ [CR] qb Chrono Cross. And indeed, if you look closely[CR]you can see `qb [CR],d$b. bits and peices of Radical Dreamers which ended up[CR]being ,d$b.[CR]$$ reused in Chrono Cross, with varying degrees of ` $$[CR]`qb[CR]familiarity. Such concepts include the Acacia Dragoons, qb[CR],d$b. an ocean[CR]at standstill, Lynx and his offspring, and the ,d$b.[CR]` $$ fusion of a girl[CR]and a beast. $$ [CR] qb `qb [CR],d$b. While Im at it, heres an another piece[CR]of trivia about ,d$b.[CR]$$ Radical Dreamers: one day when I was deciphering[CR]its RAM ` $$[CR]`qb layout, I discovered that theres an environment variable[CR]qb[CR],d$b. set for each scenario that you finish. The interesting ,d$b.[CR]`[CR]$$ thing is that there are eight of these variables, but $$ [CR] qb only seven[CR]scenarios. What may have happened was that the `qb [CR],d$b. writers[CR]originally created more than seven scenarios, but ,d$b.[CR]$$ some were deemed[CR]too incomplete (or bad, or whatever) to ` $$[CR]`qb be included. That being[CR]said, I wonder where they drew qb[CR],d$b. the line - at times, some of the[CR]remaining scenarios get ,d$b.[CR]` $$ pretty... interesting. $$ [CR] qb `qb[CR],d$b. Yes, this game may seem a bit strange, and at times, ,d$b.[CR]$$[CR]incomplete. It is in fact a pretty rushed game, with its ` $$[CR]`qb fair[CR]share of convoluted plotlines and one-dimensional qb[CR],d$b. characters[CR](wait, no, that would describe most any ,d$b.[CR]` $$ Squaresoft game...).[CR]But, like I said, its a part of the $$ [CR] qb Chrono series nonetheless. My[CR]assumption on what happened `qb [CR],d$b. was that Squaresoft probably got[CR]into the whole ,d$b.[CR]$$ Satellaview thing right after completing Chrono[CR]Trigger, ` $$[CR]`qb and as such, they decided to pump out a few quick games[CR]qb[CR],d$b. using the technologies they had just finished developing.[CR],d$b.[CR]` $$ One of these games ended up making use of Chrono $$ [CR] qb[CR]Triggers sprites and backgrounds (DynamiTracer), one `qb [CR],d$b. made use of[CR]Chrono Triggers mode 7 rendering engine ,d$b.[CR]$$ (Treasure Conflix), and of[CR]course, one made use of Chrono ` $$[CR]`qb Triggers story (Radical Dreamers).[CR]qb[CR],d$b. ,d$b.[CR]` $$ Anyhow, besides the storyline connection to Chrono[CR]$$ [CR] qb Trigger, the other big draw about this game is the fact `qb[CR],d$b. that Yasunori Mitsuda, a top name in symphony-calibur ,d$b.[CR]$$[CR]video game music, composed the soundtrack. He worked on ` $$[CR]`qb Radical[CR]Dreamers after Front Mission and just before qb[CR],d$b. starting Xenogears, I[CR]believe. If thats true, then this ,d$b.[CR]` $$ was his final soundtrack for[CR]the SNES. Looking at Radical $$ [CR] qb Dreamers soundtrack in this regard,[CR]its apparent that `qb [CR],d$b. he probably was composing with a higher level[CR]of intimacy ,d$b.[CR]$$ with the SNESs sound capabilities than when he[CR]composed ` $$[CR]`qb any of his other SNES soundtracks. Despite the fact that[CR]qb[CR],d$b. much of the material here is ambient (or minimalistic to[CR],d$b.[CR]` $$ say the least), the majority of the stuff here is quite $$ [CR]qb good if youre into this sort of music, much like Tim `qb [CR],d$b. Follins[CR]quiet yet excellent soundtrack for Sonys ,d$b.[CR]$$ Equinox. ` $$[CR]`qb[CR]qb[CR],d$b. A handful of the tracks, like the battle theme, the ,d$b.[CR]` $$[CR]Frozen Flame theme, and Viper Manors theme were reused $$ [CR] qb in Chrono[CR]Cross, enhanced with Playstation audio `qb [CR],d$b. capabilities. Head over[CR]to www.zophar.net one of these ,d$b.[CR]$$ days and check out the SPC and PSF[CR]music libraries - its ` $$[CR]`qb now possible to play ripped soundtracks of[CR]both SNES and qb[CR],d$b. Playstation music (among others) directly on your[CR],d$b.[CR]` $$ computer, allowing you to compare the material for $$ [CR] qb[CR]yourself through a player like Winamp. `qb [CR],d$b. ,d$b.[CR]$$ My favorite[CR]song? Song 06, "Under Moonlight". Its has a ` $$[CR]`qb certain special[CR]significance in RD, as you may discover... qb[CR],d$b. ,d$b.[CR]` $$ $$ [CR]qb `qb [CR],d$b. ,d$b.[CR]$$ ` $$[CR]`qb HOW TO USE THE PATCH: qb[CR],d$b.[CR],d$b.[CR]` $$ This archive does not contain the game itself, just a $$ [CR] qb[CR]patch. We translators distribute our work this way to get `qb [CR],d$b. around[CR]the legal red tape of the digital age, which says ,d$b.[CR]$$ its illegal to[CR]distribute other peoples works, ` $$[CR]`qb especially if theyre modified[CR](which is what a qb[CR],d$b. translation pretty much is). So instead we[CR]distribute a ,d$b.[CR]` $$ patch which changes the game into the translated[CR]version, $$ [CR] qb provided youve already somehow got ahold of a copy of `qb[CR],d$b. the game. ,d$b.[CR]$$ ` $$[CR]`qb Dont ask us where to get the game.[CR]We cant tell you. qb[CR],d$b. ,d$b.[CR]` $$ Anyhow, if you do have the game,[CR]just rename it to $$ [CR] qb rad-j.smc, unzip all these files into the same[CR]folder the `qb [CR],d$b. game is in, and then run cabbage. If everything goes[CR],d$b.[CR]$$ well, you should have a translated version of Radical ` $$[CR]`qb[CR]Dreamers sitting right there before you know it. qb[CR],d$b. ,d$b.[CR]` $$[CR]Alternatively, if you know how to work the commandline, $$ [CR] qb you can[CR]type stuff like "cabbage radical.smc" and itll `qb [CR],d$b. patch radical.smc[CR]instead of rad-j.smc. Its case ,d$b.[CR]$$ sensitive though, so make sure you[CR]know if your ROM ` $$[CR]`qb filename is capitalised or not (windows can[CR]really throw qb[CR],d$b. you off sometimes when it comes to that). ,d$b.[CR]`[CR]$$ $$ [CR] qb This patching program is for DOS and Windows only. `qb [CR],d$b.[CR]Sorry, I just program stuff for what I use. If youre one ,d$b.[CR]$$ of the[CR]types of people who insist on using these ` $$[CR]`qb alternative operating[CR]systems, chances are youre also qb[CR],d$b. resourceful enough to find a copy[CR]of the translated game ,d$b.[CR]` $$ on your own without having to bother with[CR]my program. $$ [CR] qb `qb [CR],d$b. ,d$b.[CR]$$ ` $$[CR]`qb qb[CR],d$b.[CR],d$b.[CR]` $$ TRANSLATION CREDITS: $$ [CR] qb `qb [CR],d$b. 1) Kid: Le Tresor[CR]Interdit ,d$b.[CR]$$ Translated by Demi, MO, and Loek van Kooten. ` $$[CR]`qb[CR]Edited by Demi. qb[CR],d$b. ,d$b.[CR]` $$ 2) Magil: Caught between Love and[CR]Adventure $$ [CR] qb Translated and edited by Demi. `qb [CR],d$b. ,d$b.[CR]$$[CR]3) Kid and the Sunflower ` $$[CR]`qb Translated by MO.

Well update the patch once a good[CR]amount of stuff ,d$b.[CR]` $$ is fixed (I dont want to release a new version[CR]of this $$ [CR] qb thing every other day - itll clutter up the GoodSNES `qb[CR],d$b. set). ,d$b.[CR]$$ ` $$[CR]`qb If youre wondering how to save your[CR]game, heres the qb[CR],d$b. low-down: the games saving feature doesnt seem to[CR]work, ,d$b.[CR]` $$ so use savestates. Savestates from untranslated versions,[CR]$$ [CR] qb or previous translation versions are incompatible with `qb[CR],d$b. this version, just as how this version will probably be ,d$b.[CR]$$[CR]incompatible with the next version, if there is one. ` $$[CR]`qb Well, thats[CR]not entirely true - loading a savestate from qb[CR],d$b. an untranslated[CR]version will definitely fuck up a ,d$b.[CR]` $$ translated version. However,[CR]loading a savestate from a $$ [CR] qb previous translation version might work,[CR]but youll `qb [CR],d$b. probably end up at a different place than where you[CR],d$b.[CR]$$ should be at, and the game engine might get confused and `[CR]$$[CR]`qb crash. If you need to do this though, try to save your qb[CR],d$b.[CR]savestate near the entrance to the mansion. The closer ,d$b.[CR]` $$ you are[CR]to the entrance, the less chance therell be that $$ [CR] qb itll crash. `qb[CR],d$b. ,d$b.[CR]$$ If youre wondering why I chose to write my own patch `[CR]$$[CR]`qb instead of using an IPS patch or something, heres why. qb[CR],d$b.[CR]There are two versions of the Japanese game out there; an ,d$b.[CR]` $$ 8mb[CR]version and a 16mb version. However, IPS patches is $$ [CR] qb really only[CR]good for when youre dealing with one `qb [CR],d$b. specific target file. An[CR]IPS patch designed for the 16mb ,d$b.[CR]$$ version wont work for the 8mb[CR]version, and vice versa. ` $$[CR]`qb This would have caused a lot of confusion[CR]and headache, qb[CR],d$b. because you know there are tons of people out there[CR]who ,d$b.[CR]` $$ dont read directions... theyd be patching the wrong $$ [CR]qb version and complaining everywhere because of it. `qb [CR],d$b. Cabbage, on[CR]the other hand, works for either version. You ,d$b.[CR]$$ may bow to cabbage[CR]now. ` $$[CR]`qb qb[CR],d$b. Finally, if you have a question about if theres[CR]any ,d$b.[CR]` $$ hidden stuff in the game, the answer is no, there isnt. $$[CR] qb Like our other projects, we have completely removed any `qb [CR],d$b.[CR]and all secret features before public release. ,d$b.[CR]$$ ` $$[CR]`qb[CR]qb[CR],d$b. ,d$b.[CR]` $$ $$ [CR] qb `qb [CR],d$b.

On November 25, 2000 F.H. released[CR]a Record of Lodoss[CR]War Technical document which contained [CR]information on how the games text[CR]was stored as well as a[CR]dumped script and an extremely well detailed[CR]Engineer notes[CR]document. With all this done we had a fair advantage at our[CR]sight and we were able to carry out a very smooth translation [CR]job.[CR]Filia claimed this translation project for herself and [CR]got quickly into[CR]the business. After a few months she finished[CR]the first translation of the[CR]script. Meanwhile at the same time[CR]hacker aziwoqpd had revised F.H.s[CR]documents and had written[CR]a new VWF routine for the game. After a couple of[CR]weeks the [CR]script was inserted and everything was fine, the first beta[CR]patch[CR]was sent to the Beta Testers and they played through the[CR]game.[CR]They noticed the lack for translation of townfolk, items and[CR]other[CR]assorted things. At this stage Filia decided to go over the[CR]script[CR]again as she had mis-translated a few bits of the dialogue.[CR]After[CR]she finished the main game script she covered the items and[CR]townfolk[CR]and the newly translated script was sent to the main hacker.[CR]So[CR]here is where we are, this time, we are releasing an uncomplete[CR]beta patch,[CR]which will eventually be finished, to the public.

[CR](07.10.2000) version 1.5: THE PATCH IS FINALLY COMPLETE! all the[CR]text has been translated in both megaman and basss storylines. you can now[CR]enjoy both endings and know what the hell is going on there. great![CR]well,[CR]this is as far as I can go. further graphic translation (as in the save-[CR]continue-quit menu and mainly the title screen!) requires a programming[CR]knowledge that I lack. I hope someone can carry on this job...[CR]thank you[CR]for your support. and thanks to Capcom for making such great games that made[CR]my childhood so happy! (Im now in college). please enjoy this game as much as[CR]I did. hope to see you soon! [CR](03.02.2000) version 1.2: second release[CR]after almost two years! the shop text and main menu have some modifications.[CR]Rolls quotes are complete for the stages of tenguman, astroman, coldman, and[CR]groundman. Also, some more final scenes have been translated (mostly in[CR]megamans storyline). More updates soon! [CR](10.18.1998) version 1.0: initial[CR]release! the intro scenes, the shop text, and menu text are completely[CR]translated. Rolls messages and some final scenes are partially translated.[CR]also the database names and Dr.Lights comments are translated, but due to[CR]space problems it doesnt say "hardman, ringman, etc.", but "hard, ring, etc.".[CR]hope you dont mind.

Believe it or not I tought myself how to[CR]translate a ROM by searching on the Net, and testing and testing and[CR]testing...[CR]When I found this game I realized that most people wouldnt be[CR]able to fully enjoy such a great Megaman title simply because Capcom just[CR]never translated it.

    <plot>Romancing SaGa is an early-era SNES RPG released by Square in 1992 and[CR]designed by Akitoshi Kawazu, the creator of the SaGa series that originated on[CR]the Nintendo Gameboy. Taking place in the fantasy world of Mardius, the world[CR]is revealed to be one where ancient gods warred against each other in the[CR]past, with the ultimate god of evil, Saruin, sealed away by the power of ten[CR]gemstones. In modern times, each country is now dealing with its own troubles[CR]and wars. But the time of Saruin's return draws near and threatens the[CR]existence of all human life. The player can choose to start the game by[CR]selecting one of eight main characters, who each have their own personal[CR]storyline that is explored in the game, as well as their own ending. The world[CR]is constantly in motion as the player progresses through battles and events,[CR]with new locations to find and old locations undergoing changes. Combat is[CR]turn-based with a slight emphasis on party formation. As each character[CR]battles, they can learn new weapon techniques and grow in different[CR]statistics. Romancing SaGa was also remade for the Playstation 2 in 2005 as[CR]"Romancing SaGa: Minstrel Song". Many of the unfinished or dropped content[CR]from this SNES version was included or expanded upon in the remake.</plot>

    <plot>Romancing SaGa 2 is considered by many to be the best of the series. Since I[CR]can't read Japanese and there's no translations that are far enough along to[CR]judge that statement, I'll pass it along with no guarantees. It does sound[CR]cool, however. Much like RS3 (which I have played), the game has a system of[CR]learning techniques from fighting and such rather than experience. The game[CR]also has a system where character age and die and pass on their skills to[CR]younger generations, though I'm not sure that the story line is specifically[CR]tailored around that, as it is in Phantasy Star III (for Sega Genesis).[CR]Hopefully someday I'll be able to write a more complete review.</plot>

It is reminiscent of some older classics[CR] like brick or[CR]pong, but with a cute style that can only come from[CR] Sanrio. You can choose[CR]amongst four popular Sanrio characters:[CR] Keroppi, Tabo, Pokopon and[CR]Hangyodon, each with their own unique[CR] strengths and weaknesses. With up to[CR]30 different levels in [CR] single player mode and a selection of 20 arenas[CR]for multi-player[CR] mode, this game can provide hours of non-stop[CR]entertainment. So[CR] watch out...you may just get addicted![CR] [CR] This[CR]project came into being due to a suggestion by InVerse.[CR] Since Magic Knight[CR]Rayearth, I have been providing my skills to[CR] various teams as a third[CR]party contributor to assist struggling[CR] groups and to improve my skills as[CR]well. At the time I was[CR] getting tired of not having a project of my own,[CR]but I wasnt[CR] ready for a full-scale project. So when InVerse showed me [CR]Smashball, I simply couldnt say no! After about 2 weeks of[CR] work, all the[CR]text was translated and after 3 weeks the entire[CR] game was completed![CR]Hopefully the game provides you with as [CR] much fun as it has for me.[CR]Enjoy![CR] -LordTech[CR]------------------------------ STAFF[CR]------------------------------[CR] Without these people, this translation[CR]would not have been:[CR] LordTech - ASM Hacker/Artist[CR] Musashi -[CR]Translator[CR] UnaFarmer - Translator[CR] [CR] I want to also send special[CR]thanks out to InVerse for the original[CR] idea and to all the people who beta[CR]tested for me. Thanks guys![CR] [CR]---------------------- PATCHING[CR]INSTRUCTIONS ----------------------[CR] Patching a ROM is extremely simple.[CR]You need three things. A ROM,[CR] the patch and a patching program. To patch[CR]with IPS, you simply[CR] type "ips  ". So if the name of the ROM was[CR]smash.smc you would type "ips smash.smc smash.ips" and your ROM is[CR] now in[CR]English. Make sure you have all the files in the same[CR] directory if you[CR]have a problem.[CR] [CR] To patch a ROM with SNES Tool, simply select USE IPS,[CR]choose the[CR] patch and then choose the ROM to affix the patch to. Its[CR]self[CR] explanatory. If you cant figure it out, the game is probably too[CR]hard for you anyway. :P[CR]----------------------- CONTACT INFORMATION[CR]-----------------------[CR] The official Sanrio World Smashball! home page is[CR]currently[CR] located at http://www.pigtails.net/ST[CR] E-Mail addresses[CR]concerning the project can be located on the [CR] official[CR]page.[CR]---------------------------- DISCLAIMER[CR]---------------------------[CR] Sanrio World Smashball and all other[CR]likenesses are copyright of[CR] Sanrio.[CR] (c) 1999 Suicidal Translations[CR]Suicidal Translations is not related to any video game company.

    <plot>Ahhh, the famous Seiken Densetsu 3. Calling this game "Secret of Mana 2'' in[CR]front of the romhacking "scene" elite will earn you a quick correction, let me[CR]tell you something. Just think, all the newbies just take it for granted that[CR]SD3 is in English. You guys didn't have to endure the sheer pain that came[CR]before. The dull, empty void. Such is the way of all translations, I suppose.[CR]So yeah, this is Seiken Densetsu 3, which is (still) to date the only game in[CR]the series to not make it overseas. It's a damned shame too, because this[CR]installment is unquestionably the best. Sure, Secret of Mana may give it some[CR]competition, but I couldn't stand SoM for some reason. And the less said about[CR]Sword of Mana the better. SD3 uses the old Squaresoft crutch of multiple[CR]playable characters within the same timeframe (see: Rudra, RS3). The whole[CR]"see the same events from a different perspective" thing works out really well[CR]here, it turns out. I seem to say that about every game, though. As far as[CR]gameplay, if you've played Secret of Mana you know what to expect. If you've[CR]played the others in the series, like Legend of Mana or Final Fantasy[CR]Adventure... well, you still know what to expect: run around and hit things[CR]with your sword. In realtime. It's like Zelda, Squareified, for a complete[CR]lack of a better comparison. Hiroki Kikuta returns (I think) to compose the[CR]music in SD3. The end result is gorgeous. The game comes highly recommended,[CR]but play the game for its music, if nothing else.[CR]Read[CR]Me:[CR]------------------------------------------------------------[CR] Seiken[CR]Densetsu 3 English Translation Patch[CR] Version 1.01[CR] Created by:[CR]Neill Corlett - ROM patch design, script editing[CR] Lina`chan - Script[CR]translation[CR] Nuku-nuku - Script translation[CR] SoM2Freak - Misc.[CR]translation[CR] With special thanks to Richard[CR]Bush.[CR]------------------------------------------------------------[CR] For[CR]further information and patch updates, visit the[CR] Seiken Densetsu 3[CR]Translation home page:[CR] http://www4.ncsu.edu/~nscorlet/sd3/[CR] To see[CR]other projects by the same translators, visit[CR] Lina`Chan, Nuku-Nuku, and[CR]Filias Translation Domain:[CR]http://translations.animangarpg.org/[CR]------------------------------------------------------------[CR]The patch may not be distributed unless accompanied by[CR] this documentation.[CR]See the Legal section for[CR]details.[CR]------------------------------------------------------------[CR]CONTENTS[CR]------------------------------------------------------------[CR]0. Whats new[CR] 1. Project history[CR] 2. How to install[CR] 3. About the[CR]game[CR] 4. Greetings[CR] 5. A word from Lina`chan[CR] 6. Legal /[CR]disclaimer[CR] 7. Before you contact us...[CR] 8. Contacting[CR]us[CR]------------------------------------------------------------[CR] 0.[CR]Whats new[CR]------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Version 1.01 (August 27, 2000) fixes several typographical[CR] errors in the[CR]script. It will work with the original ROM[CR] image, or an image previously[CR]patched with version 1.00.[CR] Version 1.00 (July 27, 1999) was the first[CR]public[CR]release.[CR]------------------------------------------------------------[CR]1. Project[CR]history[CR]------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Some call it "the best Super Famicom game ever", some[CR] dismiss it as just[CR]another boring action game. But most[CR] people agree that Square made a grave[CR]mistake when they[CR] decided not to market Seiken Densetsu 3 overseas -[CR]especially after the success of its predecessor, Secret of[CR] Mana.[CR]Around 1996 and 1997, the growth of the internet, combined[CR] with the[CR]increasing popularity of video game emulators,[CR] sparked a number of[CR]unofficial game translation projects.[CR] Several of these came into fruition;[CR]most notably the RPGe[CR] translation of Final Fantasy 5, and Neo Demiforces[CR]Final[CR] Fantasy 2 project. These groups proved that such projects[CR] were[CR]not only possible, but feasible as well.[CR] Some of the more complex games,[CR]however, have proven too[CR] big a challenge for the fan translation[CR]community. Seiken[CR] Densetsu 3 obscures its text behind numerous layers[CR]of[CR] compression, putting it well out of reach of the casual[CR] hex[CR]editor.[CR] In April of 1998, the RPGe web site announced that Richard[CR]Bush had quit his Seiken Densetsu 3 translation project.[CR] I (Neill Corlett)[CR]decided that my effort would be well-[CR] spent in seeing this project[CR]through, overcoming all the[CR] technical obstacles, bringing to the English-[CR]speaking[CR] world a game we should have had in the first place.[CR] With[CR]technical issues out of the way, translator SoM2Freak[CR] went to work. He[CR]finished the enemy names, item names,[CR] spell names, menu selections, and a[CR]small portion of the[CR] script itself, before leaving for Japan in spring of[CR]1999.[CR] Translators Lina`chan (whose work includes the unofficial[CR] Magic[CR]Knight Rayearth translation) and Nuku-nuku finished[CR] the remainder of the[CR]script.[CR]------------------------------------------------------------[CR] 2.[CR]How to[CR]install[CR]------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Included in this archive is a patch file, "sd3en101.ips".[CR] When applied to[CR]an original ROM image from a Seiken[CR] Densetsu 3 game cartridge, this patch[CR]converts all text in[CR] the game from Japanese to English. The size of the[CR]ROM[CR] image will not change.[CR] (Obtaining the ROM image is up to you, and[CR]beyond the[CR] scope of this documentation.)[CR] Version 1.01 of the patch may[CR]be applied to an original[CR] ROM image, or an image previously patched with[CR]version[CR] 1.00.[CR] * If youre using Windows 95, 98, NT, or 2000:[CR] Run[CR]the "Install" program, also included in this archive.[CR] This will apply the[CR]patch to a ROM image of your choice,[CR] and optionally back up the[CR]original.[CR] * If youre using anything else:[CR] Youll need an IPS patching[CR]utility for your operating[CR] system. Several are included on the Seiken[CR]Densetsu 3[CR] Translation home page:[CR]http://www4.ncsu.edu/~nscorlet/sd3/[CR] SRAM images from the Japanese version[CR]are compatible with[CR] the English version. However, the characters names[CR]will[CR] appear garbled. You can use the included SRAM Name Fix[CR] utility[CR](NAMEFIX.EXE) to convert all the character names[CR] into their English[CR]defaults. This is a command-line based[CR] DOS program which will work with[CR]either raw SRAM images[CR] (.SRM) or SWC Battery Backup images (.BBD).[CR]Saved states (.ZST, .RTS, etc.) from the Japanese version[CR] will not work[CR]properly with the English version, and are[CR] neither supported nor[CR]reccommended.[CR]------------------------------------------------------------[CR]3. About the[CR]game[CR]------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Seiken Densetsu 3 is a prequel to Secret of Mana. That[CR] is, the events in[CR]the game supposedly take place centuries[CR] before Secret of Mana.[CR] Six[CR]young heroes are caught in the crossfire of a global[CR] struggle to revive[CR]the God-Beasts and control the world.[CR] They are:[CR] Duran Kevin Hawk[CR]Angela Carlie Lise[CR] You will choose one of them as the main character, and[CR]two[CR] more as partners. The other three will appear elsewhere[CR] in the[CR]game as NPCs.[CR] Your character choice is permanent. The three characters[CR]you choose are with you until the end of the game.[CR] Each of the six[CR]characters has his own introductory[CR] scenario; youll begin the game by[CR]playing the main[CR] characters scenario before moving on with the rest of[CR]the[CR] game. There are also significant differences in the plot,[CR] based on[CR]who you pick as your main character. These plot[CR] differences can be[CR]organized into three "quests":[CR] Duran and Angela - quest #1 (easiest)[CR]Kevin and Carlie - quest #2[CR] Hawk and Lise - quest #3 (hardest)[CR] Up to[CR]three players can play the game simultaneously, each[CR] controlling a[CR]different character. If there are fewer[CR] than three players, the remaining[CR]characters will be[CR] controlled automatically by AI.[CR] The default[CR]controller button assignments are as follows:[CR] A - Talk to another[CR]character (normally),[CR] swing weapon (during battle)[CR] B - Run (normally),[CR]use special tech (during battle)[CR] X - Bring up the ring menu. This lets you[CR]use an[CR] item or cast a spell.[CR] Y - Switch to menu subscreen. This lets[CR]you view[CR] character stats, change equipment, and configure[CR] various[CR]aspects of the game.[CR] Start - Switch to storage subscreen. This lets you[CR]put[CR] items in and out of "storage". Items which are[CR] in storage dont[CR]show up on the ring menu.[CR] Also, press Start on controllers 2 or 3 to[CR]activate or deactivate them.[CR] Select - Toggle which character youre[CR]controlling (if[CR] there are fewer than three players).[CR] L, R - Hold one[CR]of these down to control a different[CR] character temporarily.[CR] Also, try[CR]holding the L and R buttons while pressing RESET.[CR] (Consider it your reward[CR]for reading this[CR]text.)[CR]------------------------------------------------------------[CR] 4.[CR]Greetings[CR]------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Greetings, and thanks, to:[CR] * Lina`chan, Nuku-nuku, and SoM2Freak. Couldnt[CR]have[CR] done it without you.[CR] * Dantares, loyal last-minute-bug-[CR]finder.[CR] * Dark Force, for many nice things.[CR] * Regulars of EFnet #rom[CR]and DALnet #romhack, THANKS FOR[CR] ALL THE WHISKEY.[CR] * Everyone who[CR]reported the typos in version 1.00.[CR] * Anyone I[CR]forgot.[CR]------------------------------------------------------------[CR] 5.[CR]A word from[CR]Lina`chan[CR]------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Hello emulation and translations fans! This is Lina`chan[CR] and this is my[CR]section on the SD3 readme file. It has[CR] been a year since I accidentally[CR]stumbled into a[CR] translation page, j2es translation page, after surfing[CR]around it and reading their documents on translations I[CR] decided to give it[CR]a shot and help translating games. At[CR] that point I knew nothing of[CR]translations projects,[CR] nothing at all. But thanks to many people, mostly[CR]those[CR] in #romhack Efnet, I managed to learn a few things to dive[CR] into[CR]this "scene" fully. After finishing my first[CR] translation for the SNES,[CR]Magic Knight Rayearth, I got in[CR] contact with Neill Corlett in an attempt[CR]of helping him[CR] and Som2Freak with the so desired Seiken Densetsu 3[CR]translation. Neill was very kind and he openly accepted[CR] my proposition of[CR]help. After 4 months of work here we[CR] are with a 100%, fully translated[CR]Seiken Densetsu 3![CR] During those 4 months we had been doing our magic[CR]and[CR] working on this project for you, it has been a great[CR] experience[CR]working on this project with these wonderful[CR] people. Also, Id like to[CR]thank the different people that[CR] helped me on my translation[CR]assignment.[CR] -Neill Corlett: Thanks for being a great and understanding[CR]person and for working hard on this game. Thanks for[CR] all the help youve[CR]given me in this last year. ^.^[CR] -Nuku-Nuku: My translation sidekick,[CR]thanks for your[CR] dedication, for all the excellent work and for[CR]enduring[CR] all my sillyness and crazy fits.[CR] -Francis Fortin for help on[CR]the french bits on the text ^^[CR] -The people of #romhack: Thanks for all the[CR]miscellaneous[CR] help youve given me and for the support.[CR] -My 2 beta[CR]testers, Dantares and Michael Won. For playing[CR] the game torughly the 100+[CR]times I asked you to do it,[CR] thanks! ^.^;;[CR] The translation community is[CR]growing and developing[CR] quickly, thanks to the efforts of many[CR]romhackers,[CR] utilities coders, document writers, translators and fans.[CR]However there are people who harm this community. Id[CR] like to remind you[CR]that, like you, we are people, most of[CR] us simply are teenagers with lots[CR]of free time (^.^) and[CR] we too get angry, sad, happy, etc. just like[CR]everybody[CR] else. I get sad when I see people fight over things when[CR]they could simply accept the other person points of view[CR] and[CR]opinions.[CR]------------------------------------------------------------[CR]6. Legal /[CR]disclaimer[CR]------------------------------------------------------------[CR]The Seiken Densetsu 3 English Translation patch ("the[CR] Patch") is[CR]UNOFFICIAL and is not supported in any way by[CR] Squaresoft.[CR] The Patch is[CR]freeware and may be redistributed freely as[CR] long as it is not modified,[CR]not applied to or distributed[CR] with any ROM image, and this documentation[CR]is included and[CR] not modified either. No money, goods, or services may[CR]be[CR] charged or solicited for the Patch, in original or applied[CR]form.[CR] The Patch contains a significant amount of 65816 object[CR] code[CR]which is Copyrighted 1999 to Neill Corlett.[CR] Anyone using the Patch does so[CR]at their own risk. Neither[CR] Neill Corlett, nor any of the other individuals[CR]mentioned[CR] in this documentation will be held liable for any loss or[CR]damage arising from its[CR]use.[CR]------------------------------------------------------------[CR] 7.[CR]Before you contact[CR]us...[CR]------------------------------------------------------------[CR]ATTENTION, EMULATOR USERS:[CR] If you encounter either of the following[CR]problems, they[CR] are emulator-related bugs:[CR] * The game will not start;[CR]it only shows the Sound Test[CR] screen.[CR] * The text is unreadable or[CR]garbled, or only every other[CR] letter is shown.[CR] I will ignore all bug[CR]reports unless you are playing the[CR] game on a real NTSC SNES system, by[CR]means of a backup[CR] device, EPROM cartridge, or similar.[CR] There is a[CR]known bug in the equipment exchange screen (top[CR] middle of the menu system)[CR]and another in the window style[CR] screen (top left). Both of these bugs are[CR]minor, cosmetic,[CR] and the screens are rarely used. I decided the bugs[CR]were[CR] not major enough to hold up a release.[CR] If you notice any other[CR]bugs or typographical errors in[CR] the English version of the game, and you[CR]are NOT using an[CR] emulator, please contact me.[CR] If youd like to see[CR]Seiken Densetsu 3 translated into[CR] ___your_language_here___, visit the web[CR]page for more[CR] information.[CR] If youre stuck somewhere in the game,[CR]despite all the[CR] text being in plain English, there are walkthroughs[CR]available.

    <plot>This game is at its heart a dungeon crawler. You walk around dungeons in a[CR]first-person perspective and fight monsters. But you don't necessarily have to[CR]fight them, oh no! You can also talk to them. If they don't like what you have[CR]to say they'll start attacking you, or get a buddy to help kill you, or just[CR]ignore you altogether. If they DO like what you're saying, they can give you[CR]money, or even join your party, or they can just leave you alone. You can even[CR]fuse the minions you recruit to create new, more powerful minions. Very open-[CR]ended stuff. The plot is crazy and fantastic, taking place in modern-day[CR]Japan, and involving a group of people who want to summon the god of Law to[CR]Earth so he can rule us all and everything will be orderly and, therefore,[CR]happy. Then there's this bunch of guys who want to stop this from happening,[CR]and try to summon the god of Chaos who will give everyone free will, making[CR]everyone, again, happy. It's your job to choose sides, which determines the[CR]outcome: Law or Chaos. Or you can choose neither, and kick everyone's ass.[CR]Kinda hard to do though. While the graphics aren't astounding, they're merely[CR]a backdrop to the neat gameplay and storyline. At least the artwork's good[CR]though. Some of those demons look super cool.[CR]Read Me:[CR]SHIN MEGAMI[CR]TENSEI[CR]ENGLISH TRANSLATION V1.00[CR]Copyright 2002 by Aeon[CR]Genesis[CR]http://agtp.romhack.net[CR]ToC[CR]0. PLEASE NOTE[CR]1.

The graphics are[CR]astounding for its time,[CR]the story is deep and quite[CR]literally involving, and best of all, you the[CR]player[CR]have a large effect on the final outcome of the game.[CR]You are[CR]-not- limited to a rail, you do -not- have[CR]to always choose the same side[CR]of the conflict. You[CR]have the freedom to decide, on your own, which[CR]side[CR]of the conflict, if either, is right and which[CR]is[CR]wrong.[CR]---------------[CR]2.Patch History[CR]---------------[CR]Work[CR]started on Shin Megami Tensei back around[CR]March of the year 2001. DDS did[CR]some preliminary[CR]translation work, but the scripts were messy and[CR]they[CR]needed a redump. Ian Kelley, famed for writing[CR]many strategy guides as well[CR]as being the translator[CR](note: NOT the scriptwriter) for J2E[CR]Translations[CR]Final Fantasy IV project, jumped on the bandwagon[CR]during[CR]the summer of 2001, but the scripts were[CR]still sadly flawed. Early in the[CR]year 2002, I[CR]finally got the urge to debunk (most of) the totally[CR]insane[CR]control code system in the game and produced[CR]some (relatively) clean script[CR]dumps. After four[CR]months of blood, sweat, and tears on my part and[CR]Ians[CR]part, the final result is now in your hands.[CR]June 30, 2002 - Initial[CR]version 1.00 Release[CR]----------[CR]3.Features[CR]----------[CR]Since SMT is[CR]probably my biggest accomplishment yet,[CR]I thought I should let you, the[CR]reader, in on some of[CR]what the translated ROM image, after application[CR]of[CR]the IPS patch, features.[CR]-300 kilobytes of English script! The[CR]original Japanese[CR]script probably amounted to about 100K total, not[CR]counting[CR]the fact that Japanese characters take up twice as much[CR]space[CR]as English characters in computer generated text files[CR](but not in the ROM[CR]image, mind you.)[CR]-An extra 512K of blank space was tacked onto the end[CR]of[CR]the ROM to accomodate the new script, and the method that[CR]the game[CR]uses to find its text was reprogrammed so as to[CR]make full use of this new[CR]space.[CR]-Fully autotruncated names for monsters, items, and[CR]spells![CR]Whenever one of the above is greater than eight characters,[CR]its[CR]name will automatically be truncated in menus but not[CR]in actual dialogue![CR]This way the original names of all of[CR]the enemies and items is retained,[CR]with the longest enemy[CR]name weighing in at seventeen full[CR]letters![CR]-Romanized, rather than translated, race names! A lot of[CR]the[CR]races would sound really bloody dumb when translated,[CR]so in keeping with[CR]the spirit of the game they were left[CR]untouched. A full explanation of what[CR]each race name means,[CR]as well as the characteristics of the demons[CR]belonging to[CR]that race, is included in the accompanying manual.[CR]-A[CR]subtitled title screen! Rather than try to do the[CR]original graphic justice,[CR]which probably couldnt be done[CR]in the first place, the five kanji that read[CR]"SHIN MEGAMI[CR]TENSEI" were retained and their meaning, or romanization[CR]as[CR]the case may be, was simply layered underneath them.[CR]-An dynamically[CR]expanding combat text window! The problem[CR]arose that the top line of the[CR]combat window was always[CR]occupied by the number of demons you faced along[CR]with[CR]their name, so we only really had one line for text. The[CR]window can[CR]easily be expanded, but only from the first[CR]line -- if we tried to do[CR]anything else, the window[CR]glitched! The problem was that if the window were[CR]any[CR]larger than two lines, it started covering up characters[CR]status[CR]readouts and ruined the ability for the player to[CR]effectively form his or[CR]her strategy. An extra control[CR]code was rigged up, and now the window moves[CR]seemingly[CR]on its own when necessary!![CR]-Italicized dialogue for accented[CR]and foreign-sounding[CR]people, so their text looks as weird as it should[CR]sound :D[CR]---------------[CR]4.Patch Credits[CR]---------------[CR]THE SHIN[CR]MEGAMI TENSEI TEAM[CR]Main Team:[CR]Gideon Zhi - Project leader,[CR]romhacker[CR]Ian Kelley - Translator[CR]Special Thanks[CR]Klarth - Semi-[CR]generic inserter used in the project[CR]Akujin - Coded the original script[CR]dumper[CR]LordTech - Helped me out with my 24bit pointer[CR] routine way back[CR]when[CR]DDS - Preliminary translation[CR]--------------[CR]4.Known[CR]Issues[CR]--------------[CR]There are no known issues.[CR]Please report any[CR]bugs, spelling errors, and such[CR]on The Pantheon[CR](http://donut.parodius.com/agtp)[CR]Screenshots are preferred, as are[CR]savestates.[CR]If the issue is not a spelling error, grammar quibble,[CR]or[CR]line overflow, if its something weirder (like the[CR]Fuma Bells effect not[CR]wearing off) please test it[CR]in the original Japanese game before posting it[CR]on[CR]my board.[CR]---------------------------------[CR]4.1 The Game that[CR]Hates Emulators[CR]---------------------------------[CR]The following issues[CR]are emulator issues and are NOT[CR]caused by the patch. It is recommended that[CR]you use[CR]SNES9X with the game, as ZSNES has a fairly major[CR]bug which[CR]causes the game to lock up. The following[CR]are known issues:[CR]Issue: Game[CR]locks up when changing scenes[CR]This is a problem with ZSNES SPC[CR]engine.[CR]Use SNES9X.[CR]Issue: The top half of the names in the stat[CR]window[CR]are missing.[CR]This is a problem with ZSNES. Use[CR]another[CR]emulator.[CR]Issue: Demon fusion graphics are garbled.[CR]Issue[CR]with both SNES9X and ZSNES graphics engines.[CR]I think.[CR]Issue: Fuma Bell[CR]effect does not wear off.[CR]I have no idea what causes this, but its an[CR]emulator[CR]issue.[CR]--------------------------[CR]5.Application[CR]Instructions[CR]--------------------------[CR]If using SNES9X, make sure that[CR]the patch has the same name as your ROM.[CR]In other words, if your ROM is[CR]called "smt.smc" make sure the patch[CR]is "smt.ips" okay? If youre using a[CR]Mac, a Mac IPS patcher is[CR]available. Check the AGTP Links page. If youre[CR]using a copier, you[CR]probably already know how to patch the ROM :) Be sure[CR]to apply the[CR]patch to a clean copy of the ROM, and make sure your ROM[CR]HAS[CR]a header. If you right-click the ROM and select Properties,[CR]it[CR]should read "Size: 1.50MB (1,573,376 bytes)". SNESTool will add[CR]all[CR]of your headers for you easily, and you can find it[CR]at[CR]http://rpgd.emulationworld.com[CR]In the utilities section, click on the[CR]IPS Tools link.[CR]The answers to the questions it asks you do not matter[CR]unless youre[CR]using a copier to play the game.</plot>

    <plot>The Megami Tensei series is a long one, and mostly a Japanese one. Shin Megami[CR]Tensei II is a direct sequel to Shin Megami Tensei, and takes place a few[CR]decades afterwards. You're a guy who (of course) doesn't know who he is, and[CR]he's really strong and fights in the colosseum fights in Tokyo Millennium, a[CR]domed city that is essentially the last stronghold for humanity and whatnot.[CR]Soon he makes it to the championship battle, and shortly afterwards all hell[CR]breaks loose. LITERALLY! OMG hahahaha! You've never heard that one before, I[CR]warrant! All you people who don't know what Megami Tensei is all about are[CR]pretty much cocking their head to one side and looking confused right about[CR]now. Maybe some further explanation is in order. I guess. The Shin Megami[CR]Tensei games take place in the distant future, where demons run rampant on the[CR]earth. Your advantage is your ability to talk to these demons and gain their[CR]trust. Ideally, they will join your party, and will fight alongside you and so[CR]forth. You can even fuse two or three demons to create an even more powerful[CR]demon. Pretty open-ended stuff, this. Fans of the first Shin Megami Tensei[CR]will not find much different. Thank Jesus, accessing the map now only requires[CR]a press of the L button. And there are... other differences.[CR]Read[CR]Me:[CR]SHIN MEGAMI TENSEI 2[CR]ENGLISH TRANSLATION V1.00[CR]Copyright 2004[CR]Aeon Genesis[CR]http://agtp.romhack.net[CR]ToC[CR]1.About Shin Megami Tensei[CR]2[CR]2.Patch History[CR]3.Patch Credits and Contributors[CR]4.Known[CR]Issues[CR]5.Application[CR]Instructions[CR]6.Troubleshooting[CR]----------------------------[CR]1.About[CR]Shin Megami Tensei 2[CR]----------------------------[CR]Shin Megami Tensei 2[CR]is interesting in that it is both[CR]a direct sequel to SMT1 and yet really[CR]does not require[CR]familiarity with SMT1s story to play. In the end,[CR]Shin[CR]Megami Tenseis hero decided on a neutral path, defeating[CR]both[CR]Archangel Michael and the Ashura Lord in the great[CR]Cathedral, and went on[CR]to establish a neutral republic.[CR]It lasted for maybe ten years, but was[CR]overtaken by a[CR]Mesian revolution lead by an elite squad of Temple[CR]Knights.[CR]As the decades passed, the post-nuclear environment[CR]slowly[CR]became more and more hostile, and the Mesians took control[CR]of the[CR]government, making worship of any "false" god illegal[CR]and employing the[CR]Temple Knights as an inquisitorial police[CR]force. As the habitability of[CR]Earths environment decayed,[CR]the Mesians began the "Millennium Project" at[CR]the site of[CR]the Cathedral, creating an enclosed, domed city atop[CR]the[CR]ruins of old Tokyo. This city came to be known as[CR]"Tokyo[CR]Millennium."[CR]Following a mass migration into Millennium, the[CR]Mesians[CR]established a caste system of sorts. The more elites[CR]within[CR]Mesianic society were allowed to live in the district known[CR]as[CR]the Center, free of worry and with want for nothing.[CR]The lower second-class[CR]citizens lived in the other districts[CR]around the Center. It is in one of[CR]these, the Valhalla area,[CR]that a man with no name is found fighting off a[CR]pack of[CR]demons. Taken in by an old, failed gladiator and trained[CR]to[CR]fight in the arena, he was given the name "Hawk" and has[CR]made it to[CR]the finals...[CR]As a note, you -can- opt to have the game enter the[CR]default[CR]names for the characters, but this skews you heavily[CR]towards[CR]Law. Here are their default names; if you input them[CR]normally,[CR]the game will not penalize you for using the defaults.[CR]Aleph -[CR]The main character.[CR]Beth - A Temple Knight from the Center who is assigned[CR]to be[CR] Alephs partner.[CR]Gimmel - An extremely intelligent man, Gimmel is[CR]the overseer of[CR] the Arcadia area.[CR]Daleth - Alephs approximate equal,[CR]Daleth is your main rival.[CR]Zayin - Of all of the major players, Zayin is[CR]the strongest. His[CR] role is a special one...[CR]Hiroko - Hirokos relation[CR]to Aleph is special. She initially[CR] shows up in the Valhalla area searching[CR]for a child who[CR] was kidnapped from the Center by a[CR]scientist...[CR]---------------[CR]2.Patch History[CR]---------------[CR]SMT2[CR]was started only a few months after SMT1 was finished. Thanks to[CR]someone[CR]who has requested to remain nameless for a huffman decompressor[CR]for the[CR]text, and thanks to myself who managed to rig up a small[CR]byte-swapper[CR]program, a script dump (one which was MUCH nicer than the[CR]SMT1 dump) was[CR]obtained in the late summer/early fall of 02. A few[CR]low-level programming[CR]problems persisted, but those were fairly easily[CR]conquered and a beta was[CR]ready after about a year.[CR]The problem was that due to some folk (who will[CR]also remain nameless) the[CR]board on which the betatest was being run got[CR]wiped, and the explanation[CR]of bugs and links to savestates were lost. I did[CR]manage to recover most[CR]of the screenshots, corrected what I could, and[CR]launched a second test.[CR]What you see is the product of that.[CR]May 7, 2004[CR]- Initial version 1.00 Release[CR]---------------[CR]3.Patch[CR]Credits[CR]---------------[CR]THE SHIN MEGAMI TENSEI 2 TEAM[CR]Main[CR]Team:[CR]Gideon Zhi - Project leader, Romhacker[CR]Ian Kelley -[CR]Translation[CR]--------------[CR]4.Known Issues[CR]--------------[CR]--Some of[CR]the demons are, as Ian likes to say, still speaking pidgin. For[CR] example,[CR]theres one that says "Are you really Dont you think?" Theres[CR] not much I[CR]can do about this, due to the nature of how the demon dialogue[CR] is stored.[CR]On the whole though, it should work pretty well.[CR]--Demon dialogue when[CR]using bronze boxes does not behave in quite the same[CR] manner as it does in[CR]the original Japanese version. It doesnt crash the[CR] game, though.[CR]--The[CR]end of game credits are stored as sprites. Too many of em display[CR] on-[CR]screen at any given time, so some of the names will probably be missing[CR]letters. Not much I can do about this, unfortunately...[CR]Otherwise, there[CR]are no known issues. If you find any, please post[CR]about them on The[CR]Pantheon[CR](http://donut.parodius.com/agtp)[CR]--------------------------[CR]5.Application[CR]Instructions[CR]--------------------------[CR]If using ZSNES, make sure that[CR]the patch has the same name as your ROM.[CR]In other words, if your ROM is[CR]called "smt2.smc" make sure the patch[CR]is "smt2.ips" okay?

SNESTool can add[CR]your[CR]headers for you easily, and you can find it[CR]at[CR]http://rpgd.emulationworld.com[CR]In the utilities section, click on the[CR]IPS Tools link.[CR]The answers to the questions it asks you do not matter[CR]unless youre[CR]using a copier to play the game.[CR]An easy way to tell if the[CR]game has a header or not is that if you do[CR]the above and the game does not[CR]run, it probably does have a header.[CR]Use SNESTool to remove it. And dont[CR]whine about SNESTool not working[CR]in Windows XP, it works fine for me and Im[CR]running on XP[CR]Pro.[CR]-----------------[CR]6.Troubleshooting[CR]-----------------[CR]--If[CR]the game does not progress past the ATLUS splash screen at startup,[CR] read[CR]the above section on application instructions (specifically on[CR] header[CR]removal.) Make sure your ROM is not read-only when you remove[CR] its header.[CR]Also make sure that if you previously hard-patched the ROM[CR] and the game[CR]crashes as described, you will need to re-apply the patch[CR] a clean,[CR]Japanese original ROM.[CR]--If you jump to level 99 at the very beginning of[CR]the game, you ROM has[CR] been hacked, and not by me. Find another. Thank you.</plot>

    <plot>Well, what can I say about this game? Well, for starters, it's the sequel to[CR]classic(!?) NES game, Renegade. Now, before you start running, let me say that[CR]it's waaaaaaaaaay cooler. For starters, the plot line is a lot more involved,[CR]there's no doors that take you back to the beginning of the game, and there's[CR]profanities all over the place. Yeah, I thought that would get your attention.[CR]The game is kind of like West Side Story (or Deuce's Wild for the uncultured)[CR]meets Double Dragon.You play through the game as the "protectors" of two[CR]Japanese High Schools - Riki and Kunio (and eventually two other folks), and[CR]they've been thrown in jail for something they haven't done. Naturally, you[CR]have to break out of your cell, and you of course do this by beating the piss[CR]out of everyone that isn't you. You spend the rest of the game beating the[CR]answers to why you've been framed out of all the hoodlums you encounter. Add a[CR]motorcycle chase towards the end into the equation, and that's the gist of the[CR]game. The game play is straight-forward (it has nothing that hasn't been done[CR]before in the first Double Dragon game), but it's still fun[CR]nonetheless.[CR]Read Me:[CR]SHIN NEKKETSU KOUHA - KUNIO-TACHI NO[CR]BANKA[CR]ENGLISH TRANSLATION V1.00[CR]Copyright 2002 by Aeon[CR]Genesis[CR]http://agtp.romhack.net[CR]ToC[CR]1.

Since it is[CR]not directly related to RCR, it does not have the[CR]RPG[CR]elements you might expect it to have; nonetheless, it[CR]is a decidedly[CR]above-average beatemup. Its quite long,[CR]as well, and has a very large[CR]script in comparison to[CR]other games in the[CR]genre.[CR]---------------[CR]2.Patch History[CR]---------------[CR]The project[CR]started on June 7th, 2002 out of the need[CR]for a new beatemup game to play[CR]with my friends. I hoped[CR]to get the script translated fairly quickly, but[CR]it[CR]chewed up and spat out two translators before I finally[CR]found a third[CR]who stuck with it about three or four weeks[CR]prior to this writing. Kudos go[CR]out to Datenshi for not[CR]giving up![CR]September 20, 2002 - Initial version[CR]1.00 Release[CR]---------------[CR]4.Patch Credits[CR]---------------[CR]THE[CR]BANKA TEAM[CR]Main Team:[CR]Gideon Zhi - Project leader, romhacker[CR]Datenshi[CR]- Text Translation[CR]Special Thanks[CR]Datenshi would like to thank the[CR]following people for their help[CR]with various bits of the[CR]script:[CR]akujin[CR]celes[CR]Eien Ni Hen[CR]Ian Kelley[CR]Loek[CR]MO[CR]mSprout[CR]Shih Tzu[CR]Waffles[CR]-----------------------------[CR]4.Known[CR]Issues with the Patch[CR]-----------------------------[CR]There are no known[CR]issues.[CR]Please report any bugs, spelling errors, and such[CR]on The[CR]Pantheon (http://donut.parodius.com/agtp)[CR]Screenshots are preferred, as are[CR]savestates.[CR]----------------------------------[CR]4.1 Stuff Deliberately[CR]Left Undone[CR]----------------------------------[CR]1) The end[CR]credits.[CR]They scroll side-to-side.

If youre using[CR]a Mac, a Mac IPS patcher is[CR]available. Check the AGTP Links page. If youre[CR]using a copier, you[CR]probably already know how to patch the ROM :) Be sure[CR]to apply the[CR]patch to a clean copy of the ROM, and make sure your ROM DOES[CR]HAVE[CR]a header. If you right-click the ROM and select Properties,[CR]it[CR]should read "Size: 2.00MB (2,097,664 bytes)". SNESTool will remove[CR]all[CR]of your headers for you easily, and you can find it[CR]at[CR]http://rpgd.emulationworld.com[CR]In the utilities section, click on the[CR]IPS Tools link.</plot>

    <plot>Some people call this game River City Ransom 2. It's by the same people, and[CR]it's the same type of game. So I can see why. The only problem is that what[CR]I've played of it is helluva less fun than the original River City Ransom. The[CR]premise is the same as every other brawling game out there. You walk around[CR]the streets, subways, buildings and what have you and beat up everyone that[CR]isn't you. Simple, yet effective. The graphics in this are obviously better[CR]than the original RCR, being for the SNES and all... but they took out the[CR]shopping part of the game. [s]Stealing[/s] Collecting money and buying stuff[CR]was one of the cool things with RCR... It's just not the same without shops.[CR]However, the game is still packed with all the corny dialog you can shake a[CR]stick at. If that's your thing, this game is sure to amuse you for at least a[CR]few hours.[CR]Read Me:[CR]Shodai Nekketsu Kouha Kunio-kun [Original Hot-[CR]blooded Gangster[CR]Kunio][CR]_____________________________________________________________________[CR]Patch[CR]version- Alpha 2 (Technical update)[CR]Release date- 02/11/02[CR]Group[CR]released under-Nekketsu Translations (Contact information is located at the[CR]end of the file)[CR]URL: http://www.pcpages.com/laxidman/skk/[CR]Credits-[CR]Game modification- Javan Nguyen/"Laxidman" (Nekketsu Translations)[CR]Dialogue translation- David Fisk/"Casino_Kid" and E Tojimbara (Sellwood[CR]B-Boys)[CR] Secondary translation- Javan Nguyen/"Laxidman" (Nekketsu[CR]Translations)[CR] "Bengali"[CR] Additional translation-"Johnny Undaunted"[CR]Font Design- "Deltaflame"[CR] Javan Nguyen/"Laxidman" -Squished font[CR]Special thanks- Jeremy Beau/"Gohan" (Capsule Corp.)[CR] Garrett[CR]Polycarpe/"Door271"[CR] "HxSpawn" (sorry if the casing is wrong)[CR]"Tarot"[CR] "zalas" (zalas translation domain)[CR] "LordTech" (Wakdhacks)[CR]Did you do something memorable and I happened to forget to put you in credits[CR]simply because my[CR] memory sucks?

Its simply a replacement for the amateur-quality patches I had[CR]released a year[CR] prior. There are various grammarical and spelling errors[CR]throughout the script. Simply, I[CR] have not gone through and edited all of[CR]it since I prefer to get all of the technical[CR] problems out of the way.[CR]This is really not for the casual gamer.[CR]How to patch (#1)- I would suggest[CR]going to the various emulation websites out there (perhaps[CR] the one you got[CR]this patch from if you didnt get it from my site) and downloading[CR] SnesTool[CR]from their utilities section (or wherever they host their utilities). It[CR]is quite a nice and user-friendly utility that basically, should not require[CR]any[CR] explaination on how to use.[CR]How to patch (#2)- If youre not a fan[CR]of manual patching, then I would suggest using ZSNESs[CR] in-memory patching[CR]system. Simply rename this patch file to whatever your[CR] ROMs name is while[CR]keeping the file extension to ips and youre set. Make[CR] sure the IPS file is[CR]in the same directory as your ROM.[CR]If you have the FAIRLIGHT introduction[CR]in the game make sure you patch with RmvIntro.ips before[CR]applying any of[CR]the other patches (Use method #1)[CR]Random questions/comments I figure I will[CR]get from people-[CR] Q:Why did it take you so long to release another[CR]patch?[CR] A:There are other things in my life I chose to do over game[CR]modifications. Off and on, I worked[CR] on this project. A lot of the new[CR]modifications in this patch came from the month I spent the majority[CR] of my[CR]time simply working on the game.[CR] Q:How much is translated in this[CR]patch?[CR] A:Dialogue file - 651/0694 entries (93.80%)[CR] Item file -[CR]069/0110 entries (62.73%)[CR] Technique file - 030/0035 entries (85.71%)[CR]Location file - 045/0050 entries (90.00%)[CR] Miscellaneous file- 086/0124[CR]entries (69.35%)[CR] Total- 882/1014 entries (86.98%)[CR] C:There are various[CR]grammarical and spelling errors spread throughout the rom and I see things[CR]like D042 a lot.[CR] A:Its an unedited script. If you werent prepared to deal[CR]with it, then I would suggest waiting[CR] until the final patch comes out.[CR]Q:You advertised 98% before and now its 86.98%, what happened?[CR] A:In the[CR]middle of my editing, I mustve commented out some text or something. Stuff was[CR]added,[CR] stuff was removed. All I recall is that the first version of my[CR]insertion program reported[CR] 98%.[CR] Q:My game crashes. Whats up with[CR]that?[CR] A:Read the section "Reporting bugs".[CR] Q:I remember it previously[CR]being called "Super Kunio-kun" and now its "Shodai Nekketsu Kouha[CR] Kunio-[CR]kun". Can you explain?[CR] A:And I also called it "River City Ransom 2", these[CR]names were given when I had no knowledge[CR] of the actual title. As Im[CR]nearing completion, I feel that I should show more class towards[CR] the[CR]project and go under the original name as instead of renaming it as some[CR]companies/groups[CR] have done towards their project. If anything, I plan on[CR]having the title in Romaji and maybe[CR] an english subtitle on the bottom[CR]when I work on the title screen.[CR] Q:I would like to bitch about the game[CR]modification/translation quality. How would I go about[CR] doing it?[CR]A:Dont. Apparently, you dont fit in the category of people I intended this[CR]patch be used for.[CR] Might I suggest waiting until the final patch?[CR] Q:I[CR]would like to offer constructive criticism. How would I go about doing it?[CR]A:If its regarding the translation itself. Dont, itll waste both of our[CR]time.[CR] If its regarding technical matters, my email is at the bottom.[CR] Q:I would like to offer praise. How would I go about doing it?[CR] A:My[CR]email is at the bottom. Unless its about a technical matter, I would suggest[CR]addressing[CR] the praise to Casino_Kid. Without him, I wouldve still been at[CR]Version 0.01. Ill make it[CR] a point to forward the email to him if[CR]possible.[CR] Q:If its possible, I would like to help. How would I go about[CR]doing it?[CR] A:Designing a better 8x8 pixel font with the same shadow style[CR]as the current font.[CR] If you would like to translate and you are an[CR]experienced translator, email me and hopefully,[CR] you could assist me in[CR]later projects.[CR] Reporting bugs (Read Reporting bugs section)[CR] Praise.[CR]Although Im not doing this project for it, it does make me feel a bit happy[CR]knowing[CR] theres people who care.[CR] If it hasnt been already mentioned,[CR]email me and well talk about it.[CR] Q:When is the final patch going to be[CR]released?[CR] A:When its done.[CR] Email me if theres a question that isnt[CR]listed here that you would like answered.[CR]Reporting bugs-[CR] Simply put,[CR]Im only human.

    <plot>Silva Saga II: The Legend of Light and Darkness is a role playing game for the[CR]Super Nintendo.[CR]Read Me:[CR]Silva Saga-II(English Version[CR]1.0)[CR]Introduction:[CR]Japanese Developer Seta[CR]Japanese Publisher[CR]Seta[CR]Japanese Release June 25, 1993 [CR]English Patch Production Dynamic[CR]Designs[CR]Initial English Patch Release January 24, 2011[CR]Dedication:[CR]To[CR]Bongo, for his many years of contributions to the translation[CR]hobby.[CR]Version 1.00 Information:[CR]To the best of our knowledge, this[CR]patch is 100% finished. The possibility always exists that a player may[CR]trigger a broken menu or some other glitch we never witnessed. Therefore,[CR]gamers are invited to file errata and other reports at our Silva Saga-II[CR]forum. Inviting our attention to any needed corrections that will help us[CR]produce a better and more complete English game is always welcomed.[CR]Game[CR]Description: (by Red Soul)[CR]Silva Saga-II, a turn-based role-playing game,[CR]was released in Japan near the beginning of what many consider the Super[CR]Famicoms golden era of RPGs. At the time, it pushed the platforms capability,[CR]establishing new standards and enhanced features, a quantum leap from the[CR]industrys strong run of highly popular RPGs for 8-bit systems. In fact, Silva[CR]Saga-II is the final chapter in a three-part series. The first two -[CR]Minelvaton Saga and Silva Saga (I) - were released for the Famicom[CR]platform.[CR]Set in a lively medieval world, replete with hazardous caves,[CR]dungeons, forests, and castles, Silva Saga-II provides many hours of the style[CR]of gameplay that most RPG players crave - especially in retro offerings.[CR]Although this game may appear somewhat pedestrian at first blush - just[CR]another clone of the more familiar titles - by the time players reach the[CR]second town, they will have been introduced to Silva Saga-II s unique combat[CR]system, a potent blend of offensive capabilities that pit hero parties,[CR]mercenary teams, and magical Idol powers against the dark gods evil hordes -[CR]fiends collectively known as the Zuhl![CR]While borrowing traditional elements[CR]that trace to the first Dragon Quest (with even a DQ reference in the game),[CR]Silva Saga-IIs authors managed to add several twists to the standard formula.[CR]In addition to the wrinkles in the battle system, Seta created some rather[CR]quirky and zany characters, lending themselves to offbeat humor on occasion.[CR]As we "localized" the story - benefiting from a highly refined input from our[CR]excellent translator, Shiva indis - faithfully, we strived to transpose this[CR]somewhat eccentric tone into English.[CR]The plot is sraightforward. From the[CR]very first scene, the hero and his helpers declare an obvious mission[CR]statement. Nonetheless, at times, convoluted trails diverge from immediate[CR]goals, and character roles become murky. As the captivating tale unfolds,[CR]occasional sidequests lend additional flavor to a gamers immersion in[CR]Minelvatons history and culture. Frequently in transition, new blood happens[CR]along and infuses the various battle parties with enhanced strength and[CR]capabilities. With solid visuals and haunting music tracks playing in the[CR]background, the game should grow on most players and become a cherished[CR]episode among their RPG experiences. At least, thats how it worked for[CR]me.[CR]Technical Information:[CR]Bongo` designed the tools that made this[CR]English patch possible. He dumped the Japanese scripts, imported the English[CR]font, converted the menus, solved all of the decompression/recompression[CR]schemes, and coded the insertion system. Anyone who desires to know more[CR]specifics about the technical side may contact Bongo` directly.[CR]Project[CR]History: (by Wildbill)[CR]Bongo` began working on this project perhaps a[CR]decade ago. Akujin translated approximately 50% of the script and many of the[CR]menus, but due to technical issues, Bongo` shelved the work. For a number of[CR]years, many of the translated script blocks were lost, only to be rediscovered[CR]inside the achives of another member of the translation community, in 2011.[CR]Theorizing that the coding procedures he learned building tools for Slayers,[CR]Mystic Ark, Lennus-II, and other successful patches may have solved the[CR]original issues in Silva Saga-II, Bongo` "dusted off" his Silva Saga-II folder[CR]and went back to work. [CR]Bongo` was hesitatant at first, but due to the[CR]progress already achieved, Wildbill convinced him to renew efforts. Diving[CR]into the massive quantity of script blocks (200+), Wildbill managed to[CR]translate about 25% more of the script - with maybe 90% accuracy. Although the[CR]game story became clear, Wildbill got bogged down trying to capture nuances in[CR]key scenes and interpret the full flavor of the game. After he reported these[CR]struggles on our news page, Shiva Indis e-mailed Wildbill and offered to[CR]translate the remaining quarter of the script blocks.[CR]Shiva finished the[CR]work in short order. Then, he volunteered to double check all of the scripts[CR]previously translated by Akujin and Wildbill. Due to space limitations, he[CR]also refined some of the names and terminology provided by Aishsha, the[CR]translator who built the released English patch for FC (NES) Silva Saga (I).[CR]Examining all of the 200+ script blocks for accuracy, consistency, and[CR]standardization took time. Thus, Shivas quality control work required that we[CR]pospone a scheduled 2011 release, but the result was a better developed[CR]story.[CR]Since October 2011, Red Soul managed Silva Saga-II as co-project[CR]cordinator.[CR]Team:[CR]Coordinators: Bongo`, Wildbill, and Red[CR]Soul[CR]Translation: Akujin, Wildbill, and Shiva Indis[CR]Translation Support:[CR]Filler[CR]Assembly/Tools/Script Dumping: Bongo`[CR]English Story: Wildbill,[CR]Shiva Indis, and Red Soul[CR]Bard Muses: Garrett and Wildbill[CR]Webmaster and[CR]Special Support: Taskforce[CR]Testing: Red Soul, Draken, Recca, and Garrett[CR]Production and Beta Testing: (by Red Soul)[CR]Silva Saga-II was a new[CR]experience to me on many levels. Following Mystic Ark, Ive been more involved[CR]in this project than any other, both as a late alpha tester and completely[CR]through the beta test process as both a coordinator and tester. Trying to[CR]maintain the high quality standards already achieved by D-D in previous[CR]releases, I took it upon myself to juggle these roles.[CR]Draken, Garrett, and[CR]Recca were pivotal in giving this game the polish it deserves. Aishsha was the[CR]key factor in standardizing the game as much as possible with his English[CR]version of FC Silva Saga (I). Only where we had space limitations did we[CR]knowingly stray from his naming conventions.[CR]Shiva Indis sustained[CR]dedication to synchronizing and refining the work of three translators into a[CR]seamless story that captures the culture, tone, and spirit of the original[CR]Japanese author promises to render a finished product that will elevate this[CR]D-D effort to an even higher level of professionalism. We hope Shiva will join[CR]some of our teams in our future work![CR]Patching: (by Red Soul)[CR]This[CR]archive includes our Silva Saga-II (English) game patch that we are sharing[CR]with the world. The patch contains our own original English dialogue, created[CR]by Dynamic Designs. Nothing inside our patch includes any of the material that[CR]developers of a Seta Super Famicom game called Silva Saga-II (released in[CR]Japan in 1993) produced, nor is our patch for sale at any price. We are[CR]providing it free of charge, but alone, our file cannot be played as a[CR]game.[CR]To use our patch, gamers must locate the necessary instruments to[CR]create a digital file that substitutes our English dialogue for the Japanese[CR]original. To do this, players will need to obtain a ROM image of the game,[CR]ideally as a backup file to an imported game cartridge they legally possess.[CR]By using a number of tools that are freely available on the internet,[CR]specifically, a patching utility and a Super Famicom (SNES) emulator, gamers[CR]will be able to convert their Silva Saga-II backup images and play the game in[CR]English.[CR]Before applying the patch released in this archive, ensure that[CR]your ROM image [CR]HAS NO HEADER . If you are not sure if a header is present[CR]in the ROM, download a program called SNEStool or NSRT from[CR]www.romhacking.net/ and check if its present. An unheadered Silva Saga-II ROM[CR]should consist of 2,00 MB (2.097.152 bytes in Size under Properties).[CR]After[CR]preparing a Silva Saga-II ROM without header, players will require an IPS[CR]patching program to apply our English patch. You may choose one of any number[CR]of IPS programs, all available for downloading at www.romhacking.net/.[CR]The[CR]patched ROM should play in any functioning SNES emulator, such as SNES9x, as[CR]well as SNES copiers. Alternately, if you prefer using ZSNES to play the game,[CR]you may enable its auto-patching function. After doing so, simply place the[CR]patch file and ROM in the same folder, and ensure that both share the same[CR]name (i.e. ss.smc and ss.ips).[CR]Here is a condensed NSRT table with the ROM[CR]our patch requires:[CR] [CR]File Silva2(J).smc [CR]Name SILVASAGA2 Company[CR]Seta Co.,Ltd. [CR]Header None Bank LoROM [CR]Interleaved None SRAM 64 Kb[CR]Type Normal + Batt ROM 16 Mb [CR]Country Japan Video NTSC [CR]ROM Speed[CR]120ns (FastROM) Revision 1.0 [CR]Checksum Good 0x390A Game Code [CR]Hashes[CR]CRC32 DAC1C838 [CR]MD5 7609277776AA9F2BE0DE614E7199348B [CR]NOTE: NSRT[CR]might report this dump as a possible bad one this is a false positive as the[CR]ROM has no problems, it is only reported as such due to not being present in[CR]NSRTs database as of yet.[CR]Emulation Notes:[CR]Silva Saga-II utilizes two of[CR]the Sness resolutions to display the games graphics: [CR]standard low[CR]resolution for indoors environments (houses, caves) and its high[CR]resolution mode for outoor areas (cities and the world map).[CR]While hi-[CR]res support itself is not a problem for most current emulators, one has to[CR]note that some of them as well as some graphic filters do not support this[CR]feature correctly.[CR]We tested the following emulators: BSNES, Snes9x, SnesGT[CR]and Zsnes, all tests pertaining their respective latest versions unless[CR]otherwise noted.[CR]Of these, only Zsnes deviated from the expected emulation[CR]behavior, causing the graphics to garble on certain situations (notably when[CR]moving near bridges) and switching the graphics engine with the "8" key, or[CR]activating any combination of engine options only solves the problem[CR]partially, limiting the corruption to vertical axis instead of both[CR]ways.[CR]The glitch is visual only and does not impede normal gameplay, nor[CR]the graphics corruption is permanent or obtrusive to the player. Note that[CR]this pertains all versions of Zsnes, as it is an inaccuracy of its graphics[CR]rendering engine.[CR]The other cited emulators have issues that are inherent[CR]to their graphic filters only - there is no corruption of any kind, but not[CR]all filters will work correctly under high resolutions; that is not related to[CR]the patch in any way and is, rather, a limitation of the filters themselves[CR]and the way they reorganize the pixel matrix when filtering; snes hi-res is[CR]twice its normal resolution, most filtering algorithms werent made to work[CR]with these values (nor do most SNES games utilize hi-res to begin[CR]with).[CR]The filters that seem to function under hi-res mode are:[CR]HQ[CR]filters, 4x sai, Eagle and Super Eagle are able to filter the pixels[CR]themselves correctly in these circumstances, but the quality of the result is[CR]debatable, and up to the players criterion as the performance impact will tend[CR]to be noticeable with them on.[CR]Final Thoughts:[CR]We wanted very much to[CR]release a completed patch in 2011. Considering that we didnt, ironically, we[CR]probably accomplished more in 2011 than during any previous year in our[CR]history, dating back more than 12 years to our root organizations. The first[CR]result of our groups hard work in 2011 is embodied in this English patch for[CR]Silva Saga-II. Also, let me share this: quietly, in the background, a[CR]collaborator and friend in France is producing a French patch for Silva Saga-[CR]II. At the appropriate time, well announce more about his work.[CR]In[CR]addition, Red Soul is flirting with the idea of translating a Portuguese Silva[CR]Saga-II. If people want this, contact Red Soul personally and let him[CR]know![CR]D-D has been blessed this past year with an influx of new talent. We[CR]are in the process of ground-breaking efforts to convert some of our patches[CR]into other Western languages. Recca has joined our core team and is planning[CR]to finish and release a Romanian patch for a very popular SNES RPG. Later, he[CR]contemplates building more patches in that language, based on some of D-Ds[CR]previously released English translations. Shiva Indis, who rescued this Silva[CR]Saga-II project, is now helping us finish additional translation work for[CR]Chaos Seed.[CR]This January release of Silva Saga-II is only the beginning of[CR]anticipated huge progress we expect to achieve in 2012, including at least one[CR]more big release. Stay tuned, gamers![CR]-Wildbill (January 24, 2012)</plot>

    <plot>Slayers is a role playing game for the Super Nintendo. Based on an anime/manga[CR]with the same title.[CR]Read Me:[CR]Slayers RPG Patch (v2) Readme[CR]File[CR]Created by Matthew La France[CR]8-8-2002[CR]mlafrance@hampshire.edu[CR]Ill keep this short and simple.[CR]This[CR]is an addition to the slayers patch file released by Robert Boyd. All[CR]documentation relating to this original patch can be found in the file[CR]"oldhack.txt" included in this zip file. Please refer to this file for[CR]original credits, instructions on how to implement the patch via IPS.EXE, and[CR]original translation notes, etc.[CR]What is included in this[CR]ZIP:[CR]IPS.EXE[CR]oldhack.txt[CR]slayers(v2).ips[CR]readme.txt[CR]GOODSLAYERS.tbl[CR]Additions[CR]to this translation:[CR]I have added another 10K of translated material to[CR]this patch including:[CR]- Full battle menu translation including battle[CR]commands and tactics.[CR]- Full story dialog through the first dungeon and[CR]some of the town.[CR]- Many more items, spells, monsters, attacks, and[CR]characters.[CR]- Many character labels appearing in dialog boxes.[CR]- Several[CR]location names* on the world map[CR]For the first town:[CR]- All dialog and[CR]options for the weapon and item shops, excluding the quantity counter for[CR]items.[CR]- Most dialog and options for the inn and bar.[CR]- All character[CR]dialog except the inn.[CR]Translation notes:[CR]* The "world map" seems to use[CR]an extended kanji set which overlaps values used to reference the English[CR]character set. Therefore, only the last 10-12 roman characters were available[CR]to write location names. I took the liberty of making up names from the[CR]characters available.[CR]For the main dialog, I was limited to the number of[CR]bytes allocated for the Japanese characters when writing any one statement.[CR]Therefor many of the "translations" are desperate attempts to take a lengthy[CR]Japanese statement and get its point across in only a few short English words.[CR]I tried to get around this by adding blank "space" to the ROM and redirecting[CR]dialog pointers to these blank areas. Unfortunately I never got this to work[CR]successfully. [CR]Why I stopped working on this patch:[CR]After translating[CR]the dialog in the first town and dungeon it became apparent to me that the[CR]system I was using was very limited. I do not know how to program well enough[CR]to perform a script dump and therefor used screen caps to translate dialog.[CR]Attempts to add an additional, better looking, English font were unsuccessful.[CR]After viewing the final results I decided that this was just too simple a hack[CR]for me to be satisfied with. I am releasing my final results here, as well as[CR]a copy of my character table (GOODSLAYERS.tbl). I hope this assists someone in[CR]creating a more sophisticated hack, or inspires him or her to continue this[CR]hack if they desire. At the very least, English speaking fans can now enjoy a[CR]little more of the game.[CR]Feel free to distribute this patch as much as you[CR]like. That is all. Cheers.</plot>

    <plot>Snoopy Concert is an action game for the Super Nintendo. The game is a less of[CR]a self-contained game and more a collection of four smaller ones; including a[CR]point-and-click segment featuring Schroeder. The player controls Woodstock and[CR]direct Snoopy as he performs all sorts of errands for different Peanuts[CR]characters. The player does a separate game for each character; some of them[CR]require him to do a little detective work, or to direct Snoopy to win a race,[CR]or to get a character to some place. The ultimate goal in the game is to get[CR]everyone in shape for Snoopy's concert. Games can either be played using[CR]stereo or monaural sound. The music was composed by Hirokazu Tanaka and Minako[CR]Hamano, in addition to arrangements of the familiar works of Vince[CR]Guaraldi.[CR]Read Me:[CR]SNOOPY CONCERT[CR]ENGLISH TRANSLATION[CR]V1.00[CR]Copyright 2007 by Aeon[CR]Genesis[CR]http://agtp.romhack.net[CR]ToC[CR]1.

Known issues[CR]5.[CR]Application Instructions[CR]6.[CR]Troubleshooting[CR]----------------------[CR]1.About Snoopy[CR]Concert[CR]----------------------[CR]Snoopy Concert is less a game and more a[CR]collection of four smaller[CR]ones. Snoopy (of Peanuts fame, yes that Snoopy)[CR]is preparing to give[CR]a concert to the Peanuts gang, but so far, Marcie and[CR]Patty are the[CR]only ones whove shown up. Snoopy (and occasionally Woodstock)[CR]must[CR]then help solve the gangs various problems - with each[CR]character[CR]having a distinctly different minigame to play. Reruns segment[CR]is[CR]a stroller chase, Schroeders is a standard point-and-click[CR]style[CR]abstract adventure game, Linuss is a bit of a reflex test[CR]and[CR]Charlie Browns is a trading game.[CR]This is not the best game ever,[CR]but it is clever, cute, and a fun[CR]diversion while it lasts. Personally, I[CR]liked Schroeders game the[CR]best.[CR]Snoopy Concert is mouse compatible, so[CR]if youre playing via copier[CR]or flashcart (or if your emulator supports the[CR]SNES Mouse) be sure[CR]to try it the way it was meant to be played. It makes[CR]Reruns segment[CR]quite a bit easier, thats for[CR]sure...[CR]---------------[CR]2.Patch History[CR]---------------[CR]I dont[CR]even remember when I started working on this. If the file[CR]creation dates[CR]are anything to go by, it looks like I first dumped[CR]the script back in late[CR]summer, 2003... In any case, it was translated[CR]fairly quickly, but due to[CR]some craziness with the text, the project[CR]was shelved. The issue was[CR]resolved roughly three years later, in[CR]September 06, which is when the bulk[CR]of the work was done. The[CR]remainder of the projects work was script[CR]polishing, which was done[CR]both by myself and by intrepid also-hacker,[CR]danke.[CR]April 12, 2007 - Initial Version 1.00 release. Released in memory[CR]of[CR] author Kurt Vonnegut; may he rest in[CR]peace.[CR]---------------[CR]3.Patch Credits[CR]---------------[CR]THE SNOOPY[CR]CONCERT TEAM[CR]Gideon Zhi - Project leader, Romhacker, Assembly[CR]Hacker[CR]Tom/DDS/Shivalva - Script Translation[CR]danke - Script Edit, Text[CR]Display Deciphering[CR]--------------[CR]4.Known[CR]Issues[CR]--------------[CR]--If Rerun crashes during the stroller segment,[CR]the word "CRUSH!"[CR] pops up in a little comic bubble. It should be[CR]"CRASH!"[CR]Please report any other bugs, spelling errors, and[CR]such on The[CR]Pantheon (http://donut.parodius.com/agtp)[CR]Screenshots are preferred, as are[CR](ZSNES format) savestates.[CR]--------------------------[CR]5.Application[CR]Instructions[CR]--------------------------[CR]If using ZSNES, make sure that[CR]the patch has the same name as your ROM.[CR]In other words, if your ROM is[CR]called "snoopy.smc" make sure the patch[CR]is "snoopy.ips" okay? If youre[CR]using a Mac, a Mac IPS patcher is[CR]available. Check the AGTP Links page. If[CR]youre using a copier, you[CR]probably already know how to patch the ROM :) Be[CR]sure to apply the[CR]patch to a clean copy of the ROM, and make sure your ROM[CR]DOES NOT HAVE[CR]A HEADER!. If you right-click the ROM and select Properties,[CR]it[CR]should read "Size: 2.00 MB (2,097,152 bytes)". SNESTool will remove[CR]all[CR]of your headers for you easily, and you can find it[CR]at[CR]http://www.romhacking.net[CR]In the Utilities section, simply search for[CR]snestool.[CR]An easy way to tell if the game has a header or not is that if[CR]you[CR]apply the patch and the game does not boot, your game very likely[CR]does[CR]have a[CR]header.[CR]-----------------[CR]6.Troubleshooting[CR]-----------------[CR]--If[CR]the game does not run at all, read the above section on[CR] application[CR]instructions (specifically on header removal.)[CR] Make sure your ROM is not[CR]read-only when you remove its header.</plot>

    <plot>This game is laughably bad. Most of it's played in a sidescrolling shootemup[CR]format. Your character chops up generic-looking aliens with his dual-pronged[CR]spear thing, collects the occasional powerup, takes a lot of hits, and tends[CR]to get snagged on tiny floating obstacles and pushed off the back edge of the[CR]screen. Hit detection's poor, your ranged attack is pathetically weak for the[CR]amount of damage enemies tend to take, and you move about as fast as a sunday[CR]driver. Did I mention that the colors are extremely washed out and the music[CR]sounds like it's coming from a Genesis? When you reach the end of the level,[CR]you're transported into a 1-on-1 boss fight, Street Fighter style. Only, the[CR]slightest tap of the controller sends your character zooming around in every[CR]direction, your attacks again don't do nearly enough damage for the time limit[CR]imposed on you, and again the music and color usage are pretty abysmal.[CR]Suffice it to say, if Street Fighter 2 played like this, the genre may have[CR]never taken off. There is painfully little story in it as well. It's largely[CR]boss fight chats, and even these don't last very long. All in all, Tekkaman[CR]Blade is a stinker through and through. It's a pity, as it really could have[CR]been something really good, but it fails to achieve even the most minimal of[CR]quality standards.[CR]Read[CR]Me:[CR]------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]Space Knight Tekkaman Blade Patch version 1.0[CR] Written by Derrick Sobodash[CR]and byuu Copyright 2004[CR] Released on October 4, 2004[CR]http://www.cinnamonpirate.com/[CR]------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]INFORMATION[CR] In 1998 when I was losing my internet connection, I decided to[CR]work on[CR] translating Tekkaman Blade while it was gone. When I was a kid,[CR]the show was[CR] one of my favourite cartoons, so I really wanted to see the[CR]game done. I[CR] printed out the script in NJStar and translated it on paper.[CR]Unfortunately,[CR] I had problems with the timed text and gave up. The script[CR]went in my drawer[CR] until 2002.[CR] In 2002, I dug it back out and tried to[CR]hack the game again... and failed.[CR] Instead, I put my translation together[CR]as a FAQ on the game and published it[CR] on GameFAQs. Gideon Zhi talked about[CR]hacking the game but never did... so it[CR] continued to sit there.[CR] In[CR]2004, byuu asked me to do some Dai Kaijuu Monogatari battle icons for him[CR]the way I did icons for Magna Carta (with the help of TeknoZX). In[CR]exchange,[CR] he agreed to hack Tekkaman Blade for me -- something Im sure he[CR]now regrets.[CR] I made him do way too much work on this game.[CR] I know this[CR]isnt the greatest game to grace the SNES, however, its still[CR] far from the[CR]worst game to get translated. byuu and I put a lot of effort[CR] into[CR]improving the game and adding more story information. The game[CR] originally[CR]lacked any story at all. I wrote all the prologues to help move[CR] unfamiliar[CR]players through the plot of Tekkaman Blade, and overall, I think[CR] it was[CR]very successful.[CR] Technically, byuu worked out code for 256 color graphic[CR]display where[CR] previously our best had been 16. He also added multiple font[CR]systems and got[CR] around the compressed font used in the credits. Glow[CR]shadows were added to[CR] everything to make it easier to read than in the[CR]Japanese game (which used a[CR] borderless, white font).[CR] Dont bitch about[CR]the title screen being in Japanese. We intentionally left[CR] it that way. The[CR]Tekkaman Blade logo is rather famous, and no English[CR] rendering would ever[CR]have quite the same feel. Moreover, this patch is[CR] targeted to Tekkaman[CR]Blade fans, all of who would be familiar with the logo[CR] and have more warm.[CR]fuzzy feelings seeing it than a crappily drawn English[CR] one.[CR] Im really[CR]glad to finally see the game finished after all these years, and[CR] right in[CR]time for the 10th anniversary of when the show stopped[CR]airing.[CR]------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]STORY[CR] United Century 192[CR] Humans are on the brink of extinction...[CR]The Orbital Ring System, a gigantic space station built by humans for[CR]deep-space exploration, has been taken over by the mysterious life forms,[CR]"Radam."[CR] Mankinds connection to space has been cut off, trapping them on[CR]Earth at[CR] the mercy of Radam attacks from the Orbital Ring System.[CR] The[CR]Earth is scorched, cities have been destroyed, and humanity is falling[CR]into ruin.[CR] An amnesic young man, brought in by the Space Knights and[CR]dubbed "D-BOY," is[CR] Earths last hope.[CR] With his crystal, hes able to[CR]turn into Tekkaman Blade, the only human[CR] capable of fighting the Radam[CR]aliens.[CR] He is humanitys last hope.[CR]------------------------------------------------------------------------------[CR]CONTROLS[CR] Flight Stages:[CR] D-PAD - Move up, down, left or right.[CR] Y -[CR]Throws Blades... blade across the screen, it boomerangs back[CR] using an[CR]invisible cable.[CR] B - Slashes with Blades weapon. Tap twice for an overhead[CR]slash.[CR] X - Uses the Voltekker attack to destroy everything on screen.[CR]The[CR] Voltekker takes one yellow dot. You can acquire another one by[CR]collecting a red crystal.[CR] START - Pauses the game.[CR] Boss Stages (and[CR]Versus Mode):[CR] D-PAD - Moves left or right, jumps or crouches.[CR] Y -[CR]Thrust (becomes Kick if weapon is knocked away).[CR] B - Slash (becomes Punch[CR]if weapon is knocked away).[CR] Y + B - Dash attack (knock-down).[CR] X + A -[CR]Fires a laser.

The lower your[CR]health, the more it[CR] restores.[CR] Red Crystal - Adds a yellow mark to your[CR]power bar. For each yellow[CR] circle you can use the Voltekker attack[CR]once.[CR] Blue Crystal - Makes Blade transform into his Flash Interval[CR]battle[CR] mode for 5 seconds.

    <plot>Star Fox 2 is an action shoot 'em up game for the Super Nintendo. The game's[CR]release on the Super Nintendo was cancelled in 1996, however in 2017 the game[CR]got an official release on the Super NES Classic Edition (SNES[CR]Mini).[CR]Read Me:[CR]STARFOX 2[CR]ENGLISH TRANSLATION V1.00[CR]Copyright[CR]2004 Aeon[CR]Genesis[CR]http://agtp.romhack.net[CR]aeongen@gmail.com[CR]ToC[CR]0.Game[CR]Issues[CR]1.About Starfox 2[CR]2.Patch History[CR]3.Patch Credits and[CR]Contributors[CR]4.About the Two Patches[CR]5.Known Issues[CR]6.Application[CR]Instructions[CR]7.Troubleshooting[CR]-------------[CR]0.Game[CR]Issues[CR]-------------[CR]*IMPORTANT*[CR]1) As of this writing (3:30 PM EST[CR]October 17) I dont think ZSNES[CR]supports Starfox 2. Im not sure SNES9X does[CR]either. I know it works[CR]in SNES9X 1.41-1, though, so you may have to use[CR]that for now.[CR]Although Im aware of work on a new WIP at this moment, and[CR]it[CR]will hopefully be out in the next few days, if not the next[CR]few[CR]hours. Keep an eye out.[CR]2) There are five or six different roms[CR]floating around. This will[CR]work on the "best" rom, which isnt in goodsnes,[CR]and the two roms[CR]that goodsnes lists as "Beta TD" and "J o1". Neither[CR]should have a[CR]header -- if the you patch the game and it crashes (and it[CR]didnt[CR]crash unpatched), use SNESTool or something similar to remove[CR]the[CR]header.[CR]-----------[CR]1.Starfox 2[CR]-----------[CR]Ah, the[CR]prototype to end all prototypes. No, Star Fox 2 was never[CR]officially[CR]released. I will not go into how the game found its way[CR]onto the internet,[CR]as that is not my place. I will say that its a[CR]helluvalotta fun! At the[CR]beginning, youre presented with a map of[CR]the Lylat system, with a few[CR]different things happening on it[CR]depending on which difficulty level you[CR]select. As soon as you[CR]move your chosen pilots to a different place on the[CR]map, things[CR]start happening and will continue to happen until you[CR]either[CR]A) change pilots by pressing select, or B) complete a[CR]level.[CR]Things will even continue to happen while youre battling[CR]through[CR]a battleship, planet, missile salvo, boss, or fighter[CR]squadron.[CR]Dont let things get too close to Corneria, though -- if the[CR]planet[CR]takes too much damage, its game over![CR]Another really cool thing[CR]that the game does is add incentives for[CR]playing the higher difficulty[CR]levels. The normal mode seems kind of[CR]cool at first, but it gets old pretty[CR]quickly. Kick the difficulty[CR]up to "Hard" and you have more planets to[CR]rescue, more battleships[CR]to destroy, more enemies and bosses flying around[CR]the map. And by[CR]the way, the battleship and planet levels layouts have[CR]changed![CR]Its really something else. The same things happen when you[CR]kick[CR]it up to "Expert" -- even more new and changed things.[CR]If that[CR]werent enough, there are huge General Pepper coins strewn[CR]throughout each[CR]difficulty level. Each one only appears once -- after[CR]you pick it up, it[CR]will not appear in future playthroughs. Im[CR]unsure of the function of these,[CR]other than to fully heal you when[CR]you find one, but Ive yet to find them[CR]all.[CR]---------------[CR]2.Patch History[CR]---------------[CR]I dont even[CR]remember how long this thing took. It was full of stalls[CR]and standstills as[CR]various bits of the game were picked apart, piece[CR]by piece, but thanks to[CR]the hacking prowess of myself and d4s, the[CR]compression knowledge of Fusoya,[CR]and satsus translation skills, the[CR]final product looks very, very[CR]nice.[CR]October 17, 2004 - Initial version 1.00[CR]Release[CR]---------------[CR]3.Patch Credits[CR]---------------[CR]THE[CR]STARFOX 2 TEAM[CR]Main Team:[CR]Gideon Zhi - Project leader, Romhacker[CR]d4s[CR]- Romhacker, German version[CR]Fusoya - Compression guru[CR]satsu - Script[CR]translation[CR]Special thanks to...[CR]...the unnamed person who helped with[CR]the font[CR]...Kitsune Sniper for help with a couple of[CR]graphics[CR]-----------------------[CR]4.About the Two[CR]Patches[CR]-----------------------[CR]Bundled in this zip are two different[CR]patches: "sf2-e-debug.ips" and[CR]"sf2-e-final.ips".[CR]--The "debug" patch[CR]simply applies the English translation to the[CR] game and performs no further[CR]modifications.[CR]--The "final" patch attempts to remove, to the best of my[CR]ability,[CR] bugs, non-functional options, and debug features from the[CR]game[CR] to simulate what it would look like at a public consumer release[CR]stage.[CR]What the "Final" patch does:[CR]--Removes "Test", "Training", and[CR]"Config" from the title menu[CR]--Removes the frame counter from the upper-[CR]left corner of the screen[CR]--Enables damage to Corneria[CR]--Removes the[CR]sprite data counter from lower-right of the map screen[CR]--Removes cheat[CR]functions built into the debug version[CR]--Fixes a bug if you try to[CR]transform into Walker mode in space missions[CR]Also, a few other changes[CR]inclusive to both patches:[CR]--The title screen was altered with a new,[CR]flashier title logo.[CR]--All instances "Andorf" were changed to "Andross" in[CR]keeping with the US[CR] releases of the series[CR]--All instances of "Algy"[CR]were changed to "Andrew" in keeping with the US[CR] releases of the[CR]series[CR]--------------[CR]5.Known Issues[CR]--------------[CR]--There are no[CR]known issues, barring the stuff mentioned in Section 0.[CR] Do read it.[CR]If[CR]you find any, please post about them on The[CR]Pantheon[CR](http://donut.parodius.com/agtp)[CR]--------------------------[CR]6.Application[CR]Instructions[CR]--------------------------[CR](Copied from Section 0)[CR]There[CR]are five or six different roms floating around. This will[CR]work on the[CR]"best" rom, which isnt in goodsnes, and the two roms[CR]that goodsnes lists as[CR]"Beta TD" and "J o1". Neither should have a[CR]header -- if the you patch the[CR]game and it crashes (and it didnt[CR]crash unpatched), use SNESTool or[CR]something similar to remove the[CR]header.[CR]Im not going to give quick rom[CR]info or correct sizes for this[CR]release because of size discrepancies[CR]between multiple versions of[CR]the game. Bah.[CR]Otherwise, you can A) toss[CR]the patch wherever your emulator stores[CR]save games and in the directory[CR]where your rom is, ensuring that[CR]both ROM and patch share the same name (in[CR]other words, "starfox.smc"[CR]and "starfox.ips" for[CR]example.)[CR]-----------------[CR]7.Troubleshooting[CR]-----------------[CR]--If[CR]the game does not run at all, read the above section on[CR] application[CR]instructions and Section 0.[CR] Make sure your ROM is not read-only.[CR] Also[CR]make sure that if you previously hard-patched the ROM and[CR] the game crashes[CR]as described, you will need to re-apply the[CR] patch a clean, Japanese[CR]original ROM.</plot>

    <plot>Star Fox 2 is an action shoot 'em up game for the Super Nintendo. The game's[CR]release on the Super Nintendo was cancelled in 1996, however in 2017 the game[CR]got an official release on the Super NES Classic Edition (SNES[CR]Mini).[CR]Read Me:[CR]STARFOX 2[CR]ENGLISH TRANSLATION V1.00[CR]Copyright[CR]2004 Aeon[CR]Genesis[CR]http://agtp.romhack.net[CR]aeongen@gmail.com[CR]ToC[CR]0.Game[CR]Issues[CR]1.About Starfox 2[CR]2.Patch History[CR]3.Patch Credits and[CR]Contributors[CR]4.About the Two Patches[CR]5.Known Issues[CR]6.Application[CR]Instructions[CR]7.Troubleshooting[CR]-------------[CR]0.Game[CR]Issues[CR]-------------[CR]*IMPORTANT*[CR]1) As of this writing (3:30 PM EST[CR]October 17) I dont think ZSNES[CR]supports Starfox 2. Im not sure SNES9X does[CR]either. I know it works[CR]in SNES9X 1.41-1, though, so you may have to use[CR]that for now.[CR]Although Im aware of work on a new WIP at this moment, and[CR]it[CR]will hopefully be out in the next few days, if not the next[CR]few[CR]hours. Keep an eye out.[CR]2) There are five or six different roms[CR]floating around. This will[CR]work on the "best" rom, which isnt in goodsnes,[CR]and the two roms[CR]that goodsnes lists as "Beta TD" and "J o1". Neither[CR]should have a[CR]header -- if the you patch the game and it crashes (and it[CR]didnt[CR]crash unpatched), use SNESTool or something similar to remove[CR]the[CR]header.[CR]-----------[CR]1.Starfox 2[CR]-----------[CR]Ah, the[CR]prototype to end all prototypes. No, Star Fox 2 was never[CR]officially[CR]released. I will not go into how the game found its way[CR]onto the internet,[CR]as that is not my place. I will say that its a[CR]helluvalotta fun! At the[CR]beginning, youre presented with a map of[CR]the Lylat system, with a few[CR]different things happening on it[CR]depending on which difficulty level you[CR]select. As soon as you[CR]move your chosen pilots to a different place on the[CR]map, things[CR]start happening and will continue to happen until you[CR]either[CR]A) change pilots by pressing select, or B) complete a[CR]level.[CR]Things will even continue to happen while youre battling[CR]through[CR]a battleship, planet, missile salvo, boss, or fighter[CR]squadron.[CR]Dont let things get too close to Corneria, though -- if the[CR]planet[CR]takes too much damage, its game over![CR]Another really cool thing[CR]that the game does is add incentives for[CR]playing the higher difficulty[CR]levels. The normal mode seems kind of[CR]cool at first, but it gets old pretty[CR]quickly. Kick the difficulty[CR]up to "Hard" and you have more planets to[CR]rescue, more battleships[CR]to destroy, more enemies and bosses flying around[CR]the map. And by[CR]the way, the battleship and planet levels layouts have[CR]changed![CR]Its really something else. The same things happen when you[CR]kick[CR]it up to "Expert" -- even more new and changed things.[CR]If that[CR]werent enough, there are huge General Pepper coins strewn[CR]throughout each[CR]difficulty level. Each one only appears once -- after[CR]you pick it up, it[CR]will not appear in future playthroughs. Im[CR]unsure of the function of these,[CR]other than to fully heal you when[CR]you find one, but Ive yet to find them[CR]all.[CR]---------------[CR]2.Patch History[CR]---------------[CR]I dont even[CR]remember how long this thing took. It was full of stalls[CR]and standstills as[CR]various bits of the game were picked apart, piece[CR]by piece, but thanks to[CR]the hacking prowess of myself and d4s, the[CR]compression knowledge of Fusoya,[CR]and satsus translation skills, the[CR]final product looks very, very[CR]nice.[CR]October 17, 2004 - Initial version 1.00[CR]Release[CR]---------------[CR]3.Patch Credits[CR]---------------[CR]THE[CR]STARFOX 2 TEAM[CR]Main Team:[CR]Gideon Zhi - Project leader, Romhacker[CR]d4s[CR]- Romhacker, German version[CR]Fusoya - Compression guru[CR]satsu - Script[CR]translation[CR]Special thanks to...[CR]...the unnamed person who helped with[CR]the font[CR]...Kitsune Sniper for help with a couple of[CR]graphics[CR]-----------------------[CR]4.About the Two[CR]Patches[CR]-----------------------[CR]Bundled in this zip are two different[CR]patches: "sf2-e-debug.ips" and[CR]"sf2-e-final.ips".[CR]--The "debug" patch[CR]simply applies the English translation to the[CR] game and performs no further[CR]modifications.[CR]--The "final" patch attempts to remove, to the best of my[CR]ability,[CR] bugs, non-functional options, and debug features from the[CR]game[CR] to simulate what it would look like at a public consumer release[CR]stage.[CR]What the "Final" patch does:[CR]--Removes "Test", "Training", and[CR]"Config" from the title menu[CR]--Removes the frame counter from the upper-[CR]left corner of the screen[CR]--Enables damage to Corneria[CR]--Removes the[CR]sprite data counter from lower-right of the map screen[CR]--Removes cheat[CR]functions built into the debug version[CR]--Fixes a bug if you try to[CR]transform into Walker mode in space missions[CR]Also, a few other changes[CR]inclusive to both patches:[CR]--The title screen was altered with a new,[CR]flashier title logo.[CR]--All instances "Andorf" were changed to "Andross" in[CR]keeping with the US[CR] releases of the series[CR]--All instances of "Algy"[CR]were changed to "Andrew" in keeping with the US[CR] releases of the[CR]series[CR]--------------[CR]5.Known Issues[CR]--------------[CR]--There are no[CR]known issues, barring the stuff mentioned in Section 0.[CR] Do read it.[CR]If[CR]you find any, please post about them on The[CR]Pantheon[CR](http://donut.parodius.com/agtp)[CR]--------------------------[CR]6.Application[CR]Instructions[CR]--------------------------[CR](Copied from Section 0)[CR]There[CR]are five or six different roms floating around. This will[CR]work on the[CR]"best" rom, which isnt in goodsnes, and the two roms[CR]that goodsnes lists as[CR]"Beta TD" and "J o1". Neither should have a[CR]header -- if the you patch the[CR]game and it crashes (and it didnt[CR]crash unpatched), use SNESTool or[CR]something similar to remove the[CR]header.[CR]Im not going to give quick rom[CR]info or correct sizes for this[CR]release because of size discrepancies[CR]between multiple versions of[CR]the game. Bah.[CR]Otherwise, you can A) toss[CR]the patch wherever your emulator stores[CR]save games and in the directory[CR]where your rom is, ensuring that[CR]both ROM and patch share the same name (in[CR]other words, "starfox.smc"[CR]and "starfox.ips" for[CR]example.)[CR]-----------------[CR]7.Troubleshooting[CR]-----------------[CR]--If[CR]the game does not run at all, read the above section on[CR] application[CR]instructions and Section 0.[CR] Make sure your ROM is not read-only.[CR] Also[CR]make sure that if you previously hard-patched the ROM and[CR] the game crashes[CR]as described, you will need to re-apply the[CR] patch a clean, Japanese[CR]original ROM.</plot>

    <plot>Star Ocean is a role playing game for the Super Nintendo.

One of the most-delayed and most-[CR]desired[CR]translations for SNES is finally finished! Just about every bit of[CR]Japanese[CR]we could find in the game has been translated to English and gone[CR]over with a[CR]fine-toothed comb. The only things not translated are the[CR]Japanese voices.[CR]A project for dubbing these voices is in the planning[CR]stage, so stay[CR]tuned![CR]=======================================================================================[CR]PLAYING[CR]STAR[CR]OCEAN[CR]=======================================================================================[CR]Youll[CR]need the following for the full Star Ocean experience:[CR]-The Star Ocean ROM.[CR]DO NOT ASK US FOR THE ROM. Any such e-mails will be deleted.[CR]-An emulator.[CR]As of this writing, SNES9x (www.snes9x.com) has fully implemented[CR]S-DD1[CR]compression, which is what Star Ocean uses, and therefore does not need[CR]any[CR]graphics packs to run.[CR]-Using ZSNES (www.zsnes.com) currently requires[CR]graphics packs to properly[CR]play the game (if youre missing them, youll only[CR]see colored boxes instead of[CR]the actual in-game graphics). The graphics[CR]packs are downloadable from the[CR]DeJap Star Ocean page[CR](www.dejap.com/so.php). Instructions for using them are[CR]included in the[CR]download and on the message forum.[CR]-The IPS file included in this zip file:[CR]both SNES9x and ZSNES can "auto-patch"[CR]the ROM. All you need to do is[CR]rename the IPS file to match your ROM and put[CR]them in the same folder. For[CR]example, if your ROM is called "starocean.smc",[CR]rename the patch to[CR]"starocean.ips" and start up your emulator. The ROM will[CR]then be[CR]automatically patched after loading Star Ocean, so the game will appear[CR]in[CR]English.[CR]=======================================================================================[CR]KNOWN[CR]BUGS[CR]=======================================================================================[CR]-If[CR]you have savestates from an earlier version of the patch, or the[CR]Japanese[CR]version, those savestates WILL NOT WORK with this new patch. The[CR]best thing[CR]to do is save normally using the in-game save function. This[CR]information is[CR]constant among versions and will allow you to play the game[CR]normally regardless[CR]of which version you use.[CR]-We tried getting rid of[CR]the Japanese subtitles in the intro (the dialogues[CR]in English anyway), but[CR]some are still there. Were not planning on translating them[CR]since its a[CR]pain and the people speak in English anyway. 8p If you cant make out[CR]what[CR]theyre saying, check the Star Ocean Shrine walkthrough (link below).[CR]-Only[CR]two colors can be displayed in the dialogue at any time. A very few[CR]places[CR]try displaying more than that and ends up looking a bit[CR]strange.[CR]-The techniques for Fear, Perisie, and Marvel dont have the yellow[CR]tech name[CR]in their description that the other characters techniques[CR]have.[CR]-The ?Guard item has the same description as ?Item.[CR]-There are[CR]numerous bugs that are inherent in the game and have nothing to do with the[CR]patch[CR]itself (such as an item duplication bug, and various freezing or[CR]crashing bugs). Check the[CR]Star Ocean Shrine (link at the bottom of the[CR]file) for info on these bugs.[CR]Because Star Ocean is such a huge game and[CR]has so many variations as far as[CR]party make-up goes, its quite possible[CR]that there are bugs or bad translations[CR]we missed during beta testing. If[CR]youve found one, please post it on the[CR]Star Ocean Bug Report[CR]Forum:[CR]http://board.zsnes.com/phpBB2/viewforum.php?f=16[CR]The forum has[CR]been created after the first full release, so anyone can[CR]register and post[CR]bugs there. Please read the Rules thread before posting, as there[CR]are[CR]detailed instructions on what to do[CR]there.[CR]=======================================================================================[CR]THINGS[CR]TO DO IN THE[CR]FUTURE[CR]=======================================================================================[CR]-Make[CR]Yes/No dialogue menu to display in English[CR]-Add an 8x8 variable width[CR]font.[CR]-Voice dubbing.[CR]-Add four-line descriptions in the menu (many[CR]descriptions had to be shortened[CR] to fit the three-line[CR]maximum).[CR]-Replace the elemental symbol images[CR]-Do some extra hacking to[CR]include some of the dummied-out items in shops, etc. 8-)[CR]-Add list of[CR]donators to in-game credits[CR]-Fix rom checksum[CR]-Bug[CR]fixes.[CR]=======================================================================================[CR]CREDITS[CR]=======================================================================================[CR]Game[CR]Programming:[CR]Dark Force[CR]Anus P.[CR]English[CR]Translation:[CR]Tomato[CR]Akujin[CR]Script[CR]Editing:[CR]Tomato[CR]Cidolfas[CR]Dark Force[CR]LifeBlood[CR]Graphics[CR]Editing:[CR]Dark Force[CR]Bisqwit[CR]Hades Shingami[CR]Editing/Testing[CR]Coordination:[CR]Cidolfas[CR]Utility Programming:[CR]Dark Force[CR]Bisqwit[CR]Graphics Decompression Packs:[CR]The Dumper[CR]zsKnight[CR]Dark[CR]Force[CR]Katharsis (hosting)[CR]Beta[CR]Testing:[CR]Bisqwit[CR]Opoth[CR]Erdrick[CR]Gafgarion[CR]Carnivol[CR]Maczbel[CR]Cybergoth[CR]Andrew[CR]Kelley[CR]Special Thanks:[CR]F.H[CR]LordTech[CR]Special Special Thanks:[CR]To[CR]everyone who donated money or hardware to the Star Ocean cause.

I cant believe its finally (almost) done. I went through[CR]the script in like 2 weeks or so, so I was expecting the project to end very[CR]quickly. Instead its taken 2 and a half years. What with real life issues,[CR]school, hardware problems, and everything else, Im glad to see that the[CR]translation project is finally coming to a close.[CR]As I said, I translated[CR]the script in about 2 weeks time, working about 8 - 10 hours a day during my[CR]summer break back in 2001. I then went to work on Bahamut Lagoon, and when I[CR]finished that, I came back and edited the 600 KB SO script. It was still too[CR]literal and translationesey so I edited it again. Literally, within 5 minutes[CR]of completing this 2nd edit, my hard drive completely failed. The hard drive[CR]recovery was semi-successful, but a huge chunk of the script had to be[CR]completely redone. Once this was done, my work with the project was pretty[CR]much over. Later on, I played demis stunning Radical Dreamers translation and[CR]immediately felt that the SO script needed more oomph to it. But I was too[CR]busy with work to do anything for SO anymore, so luckily Cidolfas stepped in[CR]to spiff up the script a bit. And now here we are. Yay![CR]I owe many thanks[CR]to everybody on MOs game translation message board. These guys helped me out[CR]in many a jam. There were some helpful people on the GameFAQs SO board at one[CR]point too, I believe. Also I owe thanks to a bunch of Japanese sites whose[CR]addresses I no longer have. They offered a lot of useful information when I[CR]needed context for stuff. But most of all, thanks go out to everyone who[CR]helped us get the data recovery stuff done. I actually found the accursed hard[CR]drive the other day when I was digging around in my closet. I have no idea why[CR]I still have it when its nothing but a useless piece of junk, but oh[CR]well.[CR]MANY, MANY thanks go to Dark Force, I have no idea how he does the[CR]stuff he does, and the amount of time and effort he puts into his work is[CR]amazing. I can honestly say that most of his work is equal or superior to[CR]professional game re-programming work. Cidolfas also gets my thanks for[CR]picking up the ball when I found myself swamped in work. Akujin gets props for[CR]going through those list text files and translating and documenting everything[CR]so well. And thanks to everyone whos waited so patiently.[CR]Enjoy the[CR]translation![CR]=======Cidolfas:[CR]Well, this was interesting. 8-) After[CR]playing (and loving) both ToP and Star Ocean 2, I [CR]was of course enthralled[CR]with Star Ocean. However, at the time the only menu patch [CR](by Chief Ug)[CR]was, I thought, woefully inefficient. I went so far as to teach myself[CR]basic ROM hacking and created my own menu patch based on his. With DeJaps[CR]beta patch,[CR]this rendered the game playable, though by no means beautiful.[CR]After volunteering my[CR]services to DeJap (and being rebuffed), I was[CR]contacted by Tomato and Dark Force almost[CR]a year later asking to be[CR]involved in the project. Naturally I said yes. 8-)[CR]Turns out Id be spending[CR]the majority of two months in intense conversation (i.e.[CR]argument) with[CR]Dark Force about this patch. 8-) Nearly every technique and skill name[CR]and[CR]a whole bunch of items, enemies, terms, etc. were the subject of discussion[CR]by[CR]myself and DF. I can say I got my way about 40% of the time, which is[CR]pretty good. 8-)[CR]I know that some of you will be angry about how certain[CR]things were translated, but[CR]localizing something, not only in language but[CR]also culture, is an extremely challenging[CR]procedure. Something will always[CR]have to give. If we stay too close to the original[CR](as Star Ocean 2 did) we[CR]risk sounding long-winded and robotic, not to mention[CR]confusing to many of[CR]our strictly North American audience. If we stray too far,[CR]we end up with[CR]something that isnt what the creators wanted. As an example, DF and I [CR]had[CR]a whole argument about the Sacred Beast techs. I wanted to use their Japanese[CR]names, [CR]and DF wanted to use the original Chinese names. We settled on[CR]English ones. 8p We also[CR]had to decide how close we wanted to be to the SO2[CR]names. Many translations given in that[CR]game were just terrible. Generally,[CR]if the name was more or less correct we used it, but[CR]if it just sounded bad[CR]or was inaccurate or would never actually be used in the English[CR]language,[CR]we changed it (most notably is the change from Specialties to Abilities,[CR]since[CR]a specialty is really an area of expertise, not something you can use[CR]or do). Some item[CR]names (like Stone Check) were also changed because they[CR]didnt make a whole lot of sense.[CR]While technically we could work our way[CR]around the language to make them make sense,[CR]we decided that it would just[CR]be better to use a name that was actually meaningful. 8p[CR]In the end, I[CR]think we struck a very good balance with this patch, and Im proud of it.[CR]By[CR]the way, I also took the liberty of adding in a conversation in the bar in[CR]Ionis which [CR]explicitly discusses something that was sort of skipped over[CR]in the original script.[CR](People whove previously played the game will know[CR]what Im talking about.)[CR]However, Im not 100% sure the conversation appears[CR]in all party configurations (I only[CR]tested it without any extra[CR]characters). Well double-check this in future[CR]versions.[CR]=======================================================================================[CR]LINKS[CR]=======================================================================================[CR]For[CR]news on translations and the graphics packs downloads, visit DeJap[CR]at:[CR]http://www.dejap.com/[CR]Dejap Main[CR]Forum:[CR]http://board.zsnes.com/phpBB2/viewforum.php?f=6[CR]Star Ocean Bug[CR]Report Forum:[CR]http://board.zsnes.com/phpBB2/viewforum.php?f=16[CR]For game[CR]help, lists, walkthroughs etc., as well as a COMPLETE list of name[CR]changes[CR]from the old patch versions to the new one, visit the Star Ocean Shrine:[CR]http://www.rpgclassics.com/shrines/snes/so1/[CR]=======================================================================================[CR]Hope[CR]you enjoy Star Ocean![CR]DeJap Team - http://www.dejap.com[CR]December[CR]2003[CR]Star Ocean (c) 1996 Enix/Meimu/tri-Ace</plot>

    <plot>Super Bomberman 4 is an action puzzle game for the Super Nintendo.[CR]Read[CR]Me:[CR]What is this?[CR]This is a translation patch for Super Bomberman 4 for[CR]the Snes.[CR]This is version 1.0 of the patch.[CR]How do I use it?[CR]Use any[CR]IPS Patcher and apply this patch to the japanese Super Bomberman 4 rom without[CR]a copier header.[CR]If everything works fine the checksum should be ok[CR]afterwards.[CR]Story behind the patch[CR]I allways loved Bomberman games -[CR]from the first time I played Bomberman on a C64 until nowadays. I was[CR]totally happy when I found part 4 and 5 on the SNES. Since there is not[CR]too much text in Bomberman-games [CR]I never understood why there was no[CR]translation patch for it.[CR]Well ... now I know. It was really challenging[CR](at least for me). The text routine was strange, [CR]the colour system was[CR]terror and the sprite-texts were ... well ... a lot of work ... [CR]but now[CR]its finally done and every single jap text is translated to english (I[CR]hope).[CR]Thanks[CR]I would like to give a big thanks to the friendly guys[CR]from ...[CR]http://www.embjapan.de/[CR]http://www.japanisch-[CR]netzwerk.de/[CR]... who helped me to translate the japanese texts,[CR]and to[CR]Sinap for his great tool SNESEDIT.[CR]If you find any bugs, untranslated[CR]textstrings, spelling mistakes, if you want to translate the game [CR]to any[CR]other language and want to save some time, or if you want to tell me how much[CR]fun you have with [CR]the game feel free to contact me[CR]:[CR]Svambo(at)freenet.de[CR]Greetings to all the guys on the coolest SNES-[CR]forums of the web: www.supernes.de and www.snesfreaks.com[CR]Svambo 07.12.2009</plot>

    <plot>Super Fire Pro Wrestling: Queen's Special is a wrestling game for the Super[CR]Nintendo.[CR]Read Me:[CR]History[CR]The game SFPW Queens Special has[CR]interested me for a while due to its apparent lack of relation to the engines[CR]that run X Premium and the other SFPW games. I never really messed with it[CR]much due to the time constraints and a lack of information concerning both the[CR]game and womens wrestling. However, after playing 6MS, my interest was peaked[CR]when I realized that QS was the equivalent of a beta test for the 6MS game[CR]engine. This is obvious from the character graphics and the look of the EDIT[CR](primarily Logic) and Battle Royal menus. Probably due to the graphics, the[CR]game is a bit slow and the animations need more frames (they appear very[CR]jerky), but the game is still very entertaining. Also, the game contains[CR]virtually every move that was cut out of XP. My guess is that Human took[CR]advantage of the development time for the game to try to work the bugs out of[CR]the moves that they had been unable to get working in XP. Also, QS is the only[CR]of the later Fire Pro games (that Ive seen, at least) that has the Death[CR]Valley Bomb/Driver.[CR]Unfortunately, the design is a good bit sloppier that[CR]with XP, so I was unable to do a table replacement translation. Rather than[CR]one massive label table, QS has small label tables strown throughout the ROM,[CR]making it too time consuming to attempt to document each so that a utility can[CR]be made. Also, QS has the annoying restriction of only allowing four letters[CR]for half of each wrestlers name. This makes it nearly impossible to put in the[CR]full names of the women wrestlers. I was able to put in five letters using a[CR]storage trick with only minor bugginess occuring in the Elimination mode, but[CR]any more letters causes strange text problems, so I had to shorten many of the[CR]wrestlers names (see the Identification page to see the wrestlers and[CR]names).[CR]Identification[CR]Thanks primarily to Pierre and Mike from the[CR]Manami Toyota Rules Yahoo! club, the wrestlers in the game have been virtually[CR]100% identified. (There are a few unidentified EDIT images left and, I think,[CR]two slightly questionable wrestlers.) Ive now converted the id pages to[CR]wrestler listing pages for faster loading (and since it is no longer necessary[CR]to display the images of the identified wrestlers, which causes SLOW loading).[CR]In the game, I replaced the bios in the Red Belt mode with stats which can be[CR]viewed on this page also. To see the page, click here.[CR]Q&amp;A;[CR]Q: How mush[CR]is left untranslated?[CR]A: Other than the names of the developers (which I[CR]have no interest in translating) and some clean-up of the move names, the[CR]patch is finished.[CR]Q: How do you do the grappling Hidden moves?[CR]A: You[CR]hold down and press Y+B (thanks to Drathius for this info). The "Super" move[CR](same as Special) is still done by pressing Y+B.[CR]Q: How many hidden[CR]characters are there?[CR]A: Two (Bull Takano and Akira Hakuto).[CR]Q: How do[CR]you unlock the hidden characters?[CR]A: I did it by winning the Challenges[CR]EDIT mode.[CR]Q: What does "Shine" mean in the EDIT Logic section?[CR]A: I[CR]dont know yet. Apparently, this is the same as the fourth front grapple[CR]section in X Premium, but no one that Ive talked to knows what it means. The[CR]translations was "ones shining time". I assume this is the grappling for the[CR]character when they feel unbeatable. There is some evidence to suggest that[CR]this category is also used when the wrestler is attempting to make a[CR]comeback.[CR]Any questions about any of this information should be mailed to[CR]plh@bec04.phy.gasou.edu</plot>

    <plot>Super Fire Pro Wrestling X Premium is a professional wrestling game for the[CR]Super Nintendo.[CR]Read Me:[CR] Super Fire Pro Wrestling X Premium english[CR]patch[CR] Release 7[CR] By sydra[CR] I had thought that I wasnt going to[CR]release another patch, but I ended[CR]up doing so anyway. New to this one is[CR]that the endings are finally done.[CR]Also, the team names were filled in, and[CR]the usual assortment of small things[CR]that I overlooked in the past. I[CR]suppose this patch can be called the[CR]penultimate one, even though its[CR]unlikely there will ever be a final. Unless[CR]there is someone that can help[CR]me find the hex addresses for the blocky font[CR]to the left of the move lists[CR]under wrestler edit. If that can ever be done,[CR]Ill release another patch.[CR]Otherwise, this one will be the last. With the[CR]exception of that, I think[CR]its time for me to stop translating stuff for now.[CR]At this point, it takes[CR]me entirely too long to translate to english and hex[CR]edit too. Im slowly[CR]learning the Japanese language, and maybe Ill start up[CR]again eventually, if[CR]I havent lost all interest by then. But for now, I must[CR]find anime, lots of[CR]anime. I never realized fansubs were so well done...[CR]Uhm, I have no idea[CR]why Im still typing, I think I shall shut up now. Its[CR]a readme for a[CR]translation patch, not a current events story. :)[CR] Just apply the IPS patch[CR]to the rom with a program such as Ucon or SNES[CR]tool, and please dont[CR]distribute the rom already patched. As before, space[CR]constraints led to[CR]abbriviations, and creative alternate words. For example,[CR]many of the[CR]Japanese wrestlers names would not fit, so only last names were[CR]used[CR]instead. Other things to look out for:[CR] - Quite frankly, the endings suck.[CR]I TRIED to retain as much of the original[CR] meaning as I could, but I pretty[CR]much failed miserably. They are okay, I[CR] suppose, considering how little[CR]space I had to squeeze something into. I[CR] just made a few....creative[CR]changes. Luckily they arent a major part of[CR] the game, but it just doubly[CR]convinced me to not bother anymore with the[CR] Sailor Moon RPG.[CR] [CR] -[CR]The color editing part is not so good, but I suppose it looks better than[CR]the japanese characters. But when you are only given 2 letters for words[CR]like hair and skin, theres just not much you can do.[CR] - I had a 16 letter[CR]limit with the move names, so it lead to some[CR] abriviations. Nothing too[CR]troubling though, jump is used instead of[CR] jumping, as is the case for most[CR]of the ing words. Breaker is more often[CR] seen as Breakr, and stuff like[CR]that. Some of the moves had very little to[CR] work with, so they are badly[CR]abreviated. Luckily this didnt happen too[CR] often. About the only examples[CR]are HL TD in place of Headlock Takedown,[CR] and BCL instead of Bridge Chin[CR]Lock. Not bad, considering how many moves[CR] there are.[CR] [CR] - Some[CR]problems occured in the Wrestler Edit section, but most arent a[CR] problem in[CR]figuring out. Exceptions would be "NK" which stands for "Neck"[CR] and[CR]"nonpro" which I put in for amateur.[CR] - As I stated before, 18 names[CR]wouldnt fit at all. So I just made up[CR] names for them. I apoligize in[CR]advance for the use of some really tacky[CR] names. :)[CR] - With the CPU[CR]Logic, numbered items mean that higher the number, the later[CR] in the match[CR]they will be performed. [CR]Ive noticed in the rom that there are even more[CR]hidden moves available,[CR]but I have no idea how to make them available[CR](winning all 6 belts doesnt do[CR]it). Anyone have any idea how this is[CR]done?[CR] If you have any questions or comments feel free to contact me[CR]at[CR]sydra@fidnet.com[CR] [CR]This is a little FAQ section to cover a few[CR]things I have been asked more than[CR]once. Although, it hardly helps, I still[CR]get these same questions over and[CR]over... [CR] Q: Some of the graphics are[CR]messed up, such as Ken Shamrocks head.[CR] A: This problem is fixed, but you[CR]will experience it if you patch a rom[CR] that has already been patched. I[CR]asked people not to distribute the[CR] rom already patched, but they didnt[CR]listen, now you know why I asked[CR] them not to do so :) There is a fix patch[CR]available on my page.[CR] http://www.fidnet.com/~sydra if you did not get this[CR]from there.[CR] [CR] Q: How do you preform moves?[CR] A: With most wrestling[CR]games in the US, you tap buttons as fast as you[CR] can, not so with this[CR]game. At the moment the two wrestlers lock up[CR] you press a button for a[CR]move, and thats it. Its a matter of[CR] perfect timing, but once you get used[CR]to it, its a really good[CR] system.[CR] Q: Im using SNES9x and I cant get it[CR]to save.[CR] A: SNES9x doesnt support 256Kbit sram, which is what SFPWXP[CR]uses.[CR] If you must use SNES9x you have to use real time saves in order[CR]to[CR] save. Otherwise, use Esnes instead, as it properly supports 256Kbit[CR]sram, and saves correctly. Note that snes9x will NOT allow you to[CR] unlock[CR]the hidden wrestlers, its impossible.[CR] Q: How do I use the sram provided on[CR]your page with Esnes?[CR] A: Put the sram file in the same directory as the[CR]SFPWXP rom, and make[CR] sure they both have the same file name.[CR] Q: How do[CR]I make the hidden wrestlers/moves available?[CR] A: By winning all 3 belts in[CR]either singles or tag mode. This is[CR] somewhere around 100 matches in[CR]singles, and half that in tag.[CR] Thanks go out to:[CR] - BigWierd for his[CR]NES/SNES sprite editor XCHAR[CR] - BTFight for his english translations of the[CR]game[CR] - Tuffy George for translating a large amount of the[CR] moves for[CR]me. Saved me A LOT of work, as its quite[CR] slow looking up every other word[CR]in the dictionary.[CR] Hes done some other stuff as well, and has[CR]certainly[CR] been the biggest help with this project.[CR] - Som2Freak for his[CR]help with a few words I couldnt[CR] figure out. Also helped by translating the[CR]first[CR] ending for me.[CR] - JerichoXL for his explaination of unusual[CR]wrestling[CR] moves which was quite useful[CR] - Human for making a truly[CR]great wrestling game[CR] - _Riddler_ for...uhm...moral support :)</plot>

Project[CR]Information[CR]------------------------[CR]Sky Renders Comments:[CR] The Super[CR]Gussun Oyoyo 2 translation was started, more than anything, by good[CR]old[CR]fashioned curiosity. Sevaral years prior, I was looking for a new SNES[CR]game[CR]to play, and came across SGO2. The zany, almost cartoonish tone of the[CR]game[CR]caught my attention, but at the time, I wasnt a part of RPGOne. I took[CR]note of[CR]the game, but didnt expect to ever have the ability to recode it[CR]myself. A long[CR]time passed, and I joined RPGOne. One day, Chris asked me if[CR]there were any[CR]potentially small translation projects I might be interested[CR]in working on, and[CR]SGO2 came to mind. And so, work began. From the start,[CR]the project was fairly[CR]secret (only one or two other people knew about it),[CR]so making it a surprise[CR]release later proved quite easy.[CR] The script got[CR]translated quickly (theres only about 20 pages of it; puzzle[CR]games rarely[CR]have a lot of story), while the recoding went underway in bursts[CR]between[CR]other, bigger projects. Come late September, Chris got the idea[CR]of[CR]releasing the game as a Halloween treat, to which I of course agreed. We[CR]both[CR]doubled our efforts on the game (him working on the recoding, me[CR]working on the[CR]myriad of Japanese text in images that needed to be[CR]translated). I dont doubt[CR]that mine was the easier task, for though it can[CR]be tedious to re-design images[CR]to match the original art and be in English,[CR]Chris task was far more time-[CR]consuming and arduous. His patience and[CR]perseverance never ceases to amaze me.[CR]Anyway, we didnt meet our planned[CR]release. But that was okay, as there turned[CR]out to be a few stray things we[CR]forgot about anyway. So we kept up work on the[CR]project for the next two[CR]months (on and off, as it were; Chris was having some[CR]health problems), did[CR]some quick testing (not a lot was needed; SGO2 is a small[CR]game), and[CR]decided to send the game out to the public as a Christmas/holiday[CR]treat[CR]instead.[CR] Working on this game was a joy, especially after the long and[CR]arduous Final[CR]Fantasy VI translation. I was given a chance to do something[CR]in it that FF6 did[CR]not afford me, that being the redesigning the myriad of[CR]images to be in English.[CR]It was an experience worth having, as well as a[CR]great challenge, as there would[CR]always be yet another little thing popping[CR]up that needed translation. In the[CR]end, if I had to choose again, I would[CR]gladly take on SGO2 without a second[CR]thought involved.[CR]Translation[CR]Notes:[CR] As said before, this game was much easier to translate than the[CR]behemoth that[CR]was FF6. However, there were a few things I intentionally[CR]left untranslated,[CR]which will be explained here. First is the banner on the[CR]stage select screen.[CR]Its hard to make out properly due to the pole the flag[CR]is on, but its the Kanji[CR]for ice (koori). Second is the curtain in Puzzle[CR]mode. It has the Kanji for[CR]drama (geki) on it, and is basically a theatre[CR]curtain. Lastly is during[CR]Georges ending, where his ships flags and name[CR]are left untranslated. The[CR]flags both say Big Fish (oo sakana), and the[CR]boat is called the Perfect Man (maru[CR]otoko). None of these really needed to[CR]be translated, as they either have[CR]absolutely no significance whatsoever[CR](ice banner and Georges ship), or are[CR]there more for stylistic reasons[CR]anyway (drama curtain). Other than those,[CR]everything is translated more or[CR]less as literally as possible, given the general[CR]on-screen space[CR]limitations.[CR]Sky Render[CR]RPGOne Translations[CR]ChrisRPGs[CR]Comments:[CR]Super Gussun Oyoyo 2 is a really great puzzle game worth some[CR]playtime, though it[CR]may be frustrating at times for the people like me who[CR]are not very coordinated[CR]between eye and hand movement. After we finished[CR]the 1.0 version of Final Fantasy[CR]6, I wanted to work with him on some other[CR]smaller games as well. Since we worked[CR]well together and I knew he would[CR]always do his best, it was a logical decision[CR]for me to want to work on[CR]other great games we havent had the pleasure of[CR]playing in our own language[CR]yet. Not to mention that translators are very hard to[CR]come by, or at least[CR]responsible hard-working ones that keep in touch. So at[CR]Skys suggestion I[CR]played the game a little, and ended up really liking it[CR]because it was a[CR]very different game than I had ever played before. It is a[CR]puzzle game with[CR]a cute little story and some very challenging levels as well.[CR]We started[CR]the process soon after FF6 was done. Sky made the tables and I dumped[CR]the[CR]text and sent it off to him. He had it done very quickly, and I was[CR]impressed[CR]at how fast I got it back in English. But I had other projects to[CR]work on too[CR]like FF6 1.2, Slayers, Koryu no Mimi, DQ12 French, DQ12[CR]Portuguese, DQ3, etc. So[CR]I just never got around to working really hard on[CR]it. I was thinking it would be[CR]done in a very short amount of time anyways.[CR]Boy was I wrong! There were things I[CR]have done on this game I havent for[CR]any other, technically speaking, like reading[CR]the second joypad. I still[CR]managed to learn lots of new things about the SNES and[CR]how it and its[CR]programming works. This is great because it will carry over to our[CR]other up[CR]and coming projects. During the early part of October 2004 (I think)[CR]we[CR]decided we would try and finish it up for our Halloween celebration at[CR]RPGOne on[CR]the 31st. Well doing variable width fonts for all 3 text systems[CR]alone was going[CR]to be a job in that amount of time, and I just couldnt[CR]quite get it all together[CR]by then. Sky Render did all the graphic work for[CR]this game including fonts and[CR]title screen and most of it during that[CR]month. We even learned better ways of[CR]dealing with graphics in SNES[CR]projects as a result. I had managed to get a[CR]sketchy vwf routine for 1 of[CR]the 3 text systems in place with many problems left[CR]in it, and finish the[CR]menus (which are done in pseudo-vwf) and pretty much all[CR]the rest of the[CR]games graphic text. But there were still too many issues to have[CR]a 1.0[CR]version done for that day. During November I just couldnt find[CR]enough[CR]ooomph to get the font programming done due to health and other[CR]reasons, but when[CR]December came around that all changed. It seemed after a[CR]couple weeks of[CR]scrapping all my variable width font work and starting over[CR]I was just not making[CR]any progress, but I kept at it. On December 21st[CR]2004, it all started to finally[CR]look good and come together at once. In the[CR]past 2 days, the game has gone from[CR]pretty bad shape still to comepletely[CR]done. What you have here is the final[CR]result of our efforts so far.[CR]If[CR]it wasnt for Sky Render shouldering the burden of a lot of things on[CR]this[CR]project we would probably still be working on it. So a lot of credit[CR]goes to him[CR]for this game translation. It is a really fun game, so give it[CR]a try! I hope you[CR]enjoy it as much as we are now.[CR]ChrisRPG[CR]RPGOne[CR]Translations[CR]------------------[CR]IV. About the[CR]Game[CR]------------------[CR] Super Gussun Oyoyo 2 is very different from[CR]most games, and has a brief history,[CR]which befits such a simple title. The[CR]games predecessor was released originally[CR]as an arcade game in Japan, and[CR]with its strange mix of Lemmings and Tetris[CR]gameplay, it hit off fairly[CR]well. When the time came to make a sequel, they[CR]decided to change a number[CR]of things from the first game. The second game is set[CR]on an island instead[CR]of in a cave, and it also contains numerous layout and[CR]control[CR]improvements. They also added a new gameplay mode (Puzzle Gussun),[CR]and[CR]modified the Versus mode to be more interesting and fun. Unlike the[CR]original[CR]Super Gussun Oyoyo, SGO2 has never been released on any other[CR]system (SGO1 was[CR]later re-released on the Sega CD, with improved[CR]graphics).[CR] IREM still makes Gussun Oyoyo games, their latest being a[CR]PlayStation one called[CR]Gussun Paradise (or Yoyos Puzzle Park in Europe and[CR]Australia; it was never[CR]released in the US). Theyre also known for making[CR]the R-TYPE series, and are[CR]planning to release an action RPG soon called[CR]Bumpy Trot.[CR]-----------------------[CR]V. How to Start[CR]Playing[CR]-----------------------[CR] You will need to apply this patch onto[CR]a ROM image of Super Gussun Oyoyo 2.[CR]Please do not ask us where to obtain[CR]this image, it can be done with a careful[CR]search of the Internet. However,[CR]it is required that this patch be applied to an[CR]ORIGINAL, unmodified[CR]ROM.[CR] To apply the image, you will need an IPS patching program. The[CR]easiest one to[CR]use would be IPSWin. You can get this and other programs[CR]from www.emuxhaven.net.[CR]Open this IPS program and apply the patch[CR](SGO2E.IPS) to the original Super[CR]Gussun Oyoyo 2 ROM. After you patched the[CR]ROM, just start up your emulator, load[CR]up the ROM, and start[CR]playing![CR]--------------------[CR]VI. Playing the Game[CR]--------------------[CR]Super Gussun Oyoyo 2 controls:[CR]D-Pad: Move[CR]cursor (menus), move current block (game)[CR]A: Confirm (menus), rotate block[CR]clockwise/detonate bomb (game)[CR]B: Cancel (menus), rotate block counter-[CR]clockwise/detonate bomb (game)[CR]X: Not used[CR]Y: Not used[CR]Select: Not[CR]used[CR]Start: Pause (game)[CR]L: Not used[CR]R: Not used[CR] Either[CR]controller can be used. Controller 1 controls Gussun, controller 2[CR]controls[CR]Oyoyo.[CR] Gameplay Modes: There are 3 modes: Game, Puzzle, and Versus. Game[CR]mode is[CR]outlined in detail in the sections below, and is where the games[CR]story can be[CR]found. Puzzle mode has you trying to get your villager to the[CR]goal as quickly as[CR]possible, usually via some very fiendish puzzles. Versus[CR]mode is a 2-player-only[CR]mode that lets you test your block-stacking and[CR]villager-moving skill against a[CR]fellow player. Sadly, there is no CPU[CR]setting for Versus mode.[CR] Gameplay Basics: Your goal, for Game and Puzzle[CR]mode, is to get your Nanoda[CR]Villager (Gussun, Oyoyo, or one youve made for[CR]Puzzle mode) to one of the exits[CR]for the current level. In Versus, your[CR]goal is simply to survive. Both of these[CR]goals require you to utilize the[CR]blocks you have control of to help the Nanoda[CR]Villagers get to where you[CR]want them. The simplest way to do this is by building[CR]staircases out of the[CR]blocks for them to climb up, but more subtle means exist;[CR]the villagers are[CR]always on the move, and can climb onto objects even before they[CR]are placed.[CR]You can also push them with objects, which can be a useful way to[CR]get them[CR]to goals. And you can also scare them for a few seconds by dropping a[CR]block[CR]right next to them. They move twice as fast and climb instantly[CR]when[CR]scared. However, theyre also harder to keep up with when theyre this[CR]way.[CR] Hazards: Quite a number of obstacles lie in your way. Most notably[CR]are[CR]monsters, spikes, and water. Monsters can be dealt with by either[CR]squishing them[CR](be careful when doing this from above; your block will drop[CR]out of control once[CR]the enemy is squished!) or trapping them. The latter is[CR]preferred, as the[CR]monsters will respawn after a certain amount of time.[CR]Spikes are a more terrain-[CR]based hazard, and easily avoided; they can only[CR]kill the Nanoda Villagers from[CR]the side theyre facing, so if you block off[CR]that side, they cant do anything.[CR]Water is the biggest hazard of them all.[CR]After a certain amount of time in a[CR]level, the water will start rising, and[CR]if the villager gets too far underwater,[CR]theyll drown! The easiest solution[CR]to this is to reach the exit before the[CR]water can get high enough to cause[CR]this.[CR] Items: There are a number of items you can obtain in SGO2. First is[CR]the mini-[CR]villager. These smaller villagers will trail your hero, and if[CR]they reach the[CR]goal along with the hero, theyll be added to your total. Any[CR]time you collect[CR]10 of them, you get an extra life. Next up is the Chalice,[CR]which will cause your[CR]villager to kill any enemies he touches for the next[CR]10 seconds, starting from[CR]when hes hit. Theres also the Air Bubble, which[CR]will let your villager survive[CR]underwater for 10 seconds. The Water Crystal[CR]will lower the water level by half[CR]of the levels total height, and is[CR]critical in certain levels. The Stopwatch[CR]will halt all enemies and prevent[CR]the water from rising for 10 seconds. And[CR]lastly, food items give point[CR]bonuses. You can carry up to two Chalices and/or[CR]Air Bubbles with you[CR]between levels, but all other items cannot be transferred[CR]over (save mini-[CR]villagers, as explained above).[CR]Versus Items: Versus mode uses a different[CR]set of items entirely. These items[CR]are as follows: the X block (which[CR]causes the next 3 blocks dropped by your[CR]opponent to be immovable), the[CR]fire extinguisher (which stops the flames on your[CR]side for about 10[CR]seconds), the medkit (which restores some health), and the[CR]bomb (which[CR]drops a bomb in a random location on your opponents[CR]side).[CR]---------------[CR]VII. Known Bugs[CR]---------------[CR] These are[CR]the known issues caused by the Super Gussun Oyoyo 2 patch.[CR]* - The ending[CR]sequence does not flicker excessively, but it does in the Japanese[CR]version.[CR](Skys note: I dont really think thats a bug; more like an[CR]improvement. Then[CR]again, Im not a big fan of excessively flickering things...)[CR] These issues[CR]are inherent in the game.[CR]* - In Versus mode, if the current level drops 1[CR]or more greater than the level[CR]that your character is standing on, and[CR]there is a block above them in the[CR]appropriate position, they will become[CR]trapped inside of that block when the[CR]level is done[CR]dropping.[CR]-------------[CR]VIII.

    <plot>Puyo Puyo is a very popular block-a-riffic puzzler made for a variety of[CR]platforms. What's block-a-riffic? Well, it's one of those games where blocks[CR]rain down from the heavens and you have to match a bunch of the same color and[CR]make them disappear. In fact, the original Puyo Puyo was ported as Kirby's[CR]Avalanche and Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine, respectively for Nintendo and[CR]Sega consoles. This version has a lot of nifty extras, like a story mode and[CR]whatnot. Isn't Arle the cutest?! I mean, damn!

It also reflected[CR]my skill[CR]as a romhacker at the time; while several menus were[CR]expanded,[CR]more than a few things had to be truncated, the font[CR]was[CR]simply too big for what it needed to display, and my sense[CR]of proper[CR]aesthetics in things like chapter title displays[CR]needed refinement. The new[CR]version fixes all that, and looks[CR]much, much closer to the Super Robot Wars[CR]EX translation[CR]released a few months ago. In fact, since 3 and EX[CR]share[CR]an engine, I was able to port much of EX`s code to SRW3[CR]without a[CR]whole lot of difficulty.[CR]June 24, 2019 - Version 2.00m2 Release[CR]--Fixes[CR]to the music persistence patch[CR]June 24, 2019 - Version 2.00[CR]Release[CR]December 25, 2002 - Initial version 1.00[CR]Release[CR]---------------[CR]3.Patch Credits[CR]---------------[CR]THE SUPER[CR]ROBOT WARS 3 TEAM[CR]Main Team:[CR]Gideon Zhi - Project leader,[CR]romhacker[CR]TheMajinZenki - Translator[CR]Akujin - Translator[CR]Fei -[CR]Editor[CR]Mugi - Title Screen[CR]Special Thanks, in no particular[CR]order:[CR]Klarth, LordTech, Dark Force, Jair, Anus P,[CR]the MO Board Crowd,[CR]Bongo`, Neill Corlett,[CR]Taskforce, Nightcrawler,[CR]BMF54123[CR]--------------[CR]4.Known Issues[CR]--------------[CR]There are no[CR]known issues.[CR]--------------------------[CR]5.Application[CR]Instructions[CR]--------------------------[CR]Quick ROM Info:[CR]1.50 MB[CR](12mbit LoROM) WITHOUT header.

It also reflected[CR]my skill[CR]as a romhacker at the time; while several menus were[CR]expanded,[CR]more than a few things had to be truncated, the font[CR]was[CR]simply too big for what it needed to display, and my sense[CR]of proper[CR]aesthetics in things like chapter title displays[CR]needed refinement. The new[CR]version fixes all that, and looks[CR]much, much closer to the Super Robot Wars[CR]EX translation[CR]released a few months ago. In fact, since 3 and EX[CR]share[CR]an engine, I was able to port much of EX`s code to SRW3[CR]without a[CR]whole lot of difficulty.[CR]June 24, 2019 - Version 2.00m2 Release[CR]--Fixes[CR]to the music persistence patch[CR]June 24, 2019 - Version 2.00[CR]Release[CR]December 25, 2002 - Initial version 1.00[CR]Release[CR]---------------[CR]3.Patch Credits[CR]---------------[CR]THE SUPER[CR]ROBOT WARS 3 TEAM[CR]Main Team:[CR]Gideon Zhi - Project leader,[CR]romhacker[CR]TheMajinZenki - Translator[CR]Akujin - Translator[CR]Fei -[CR]Editor[CR]Mugi - Title Screen[CR]Special Thanks, in no particular[CR]order:[CR]Klarth, LordTech, Dark Force, Jair, Anus P,[CR]the MO Board Crowd,[CR]Bongo`, Neill Corlett,[CR]Taskforce, Nightcrawler,[CR]BMF54123[CR]--------------[CR]4.Known Issues[CR]--------------[CR]There are no[CR]known issues.[CR]--------------------------[CR]5.Application[CR]Instructions[CR]--------------------------[CR]Quick ROM Info:[CR]1.50 MB[CR](12mbit LoROM) WITHOUT header.

    <plot>Ahh, Tactics Ogre. If you like strategy RPG's at all and you have not played[CR]this game you owe it to yourself to try it. Tactics Ogre features a vast[CR]storyline with different paths depending on crucial moral decisions you are[CR]forced to make throughout the game. I believe there are eight different[CR]endings depending on which path you choose to take. The storyline is very[CR]interesting and the fact that the game changes depending on which decisions[CR]you make provides replay value. The basic storyline starts off with the main[CR]character and his two friends fighting for a liberation army against an evil[CR]empire. It picks up fast from there. The battles are the typical grid format[CR]turn based strategy RPG style. Ten total allies can be controlled during[CR]combat. The games features a class system. If you have played any of the Ogre[CR]Battle games you will know which types of classes are included. You can train[CR]mages, knights, ninjas, archers, dragon trainers, and so many more. On top of[CR]all the human classes, you can recruit any beast in the game to add to your[CR]squad. Some of the beasts are dragons, griffons, undead monsters, fairies, and[CR]many more. There is a lot of customization in this game. The game will[CR]probably take you 30-50 hours to complete depending on your skill and how much[CR]you enjoy grinding, side quests, and etc. I highly recommend this game if you[CR]enjoy strategy RPG's at all. I would imagine anybody that does enjoy strategy[CR]RPG's has already played this game as it is known as being one of the very[CR]best.[CR]Read Me:[CR]TACTICS OGRE - LET US CLING TOGETHER[CR]ENGLISH[CR]TRANSLATION V1.00b[CR]Copyright 2010 by Aeon[CR]Genesis[CR]http://agtp.romhack.net[CR]ToC[CR]1.About Tactics Ogre[CR]2.Patch[CR]History[CR]3.Patch Credits and Contributors[CR]4.Known issues[CR]5.Application[CR]Instructions[CR]--------------------[CR]1.About Tactics[CR]Ogre[CR]--------------------[CR]Tactics Ogre doesnt really need much[CR]introduction.

We recommend you start 3 U[CR] U 3 over from the beginning,[CR]rather than continuing where the game dies 3 U[CR] U 3 using the beta patch.[CR]Youll enjoy it a lot more if you do. 3 U[CR] U 3 3 U[CR] U 3 3 U[CR] U 3 Files[CR]3 U[CR] U 3 ~~~~~ 3 U[CR] U 3 Topfinal.txt - This file 3 U[CR] U 3[CR]Top_gd7u.ips - Patch for interleaved rom (upper case 8x8 font) 3 U[CR] U 3[CR]Top_dx2u.ips - Patch for non-interleaved rom (upper case 8x8 font) 3 U[CR] U 3[CR]Top_gd7l.ips - Patch for interleaved rom (lower case 8x8 font) 3 U[CR] U 3[CR]Top_dx2l.ips - Patch for non-interleaved rom (lower case 8x8 font) 3 U[CR] U 3[CR]3 U[CR] U 3 3 U[CR] U 3 How to Patch 3 U[CR] U 3 ~~~~~~~~~~~~ 3 U[CR] U 3 The[CR]patch requires an original Japanese rom with a 512 byte header, 3 U[CR] U 3[CR]making it 6,291,968 bytes in size. If the rom is only 6,291,456 3 U[CR] U 3[CR]bytes, it does not have a header. Included are patches for both the 3 U[CR] U[CR]3 interleaved and non-interleaved roms. Use the format conversion 3 U[CR] U 3[CR]programs to determine if your rom is interleaved or not. 3 U[CR] U 3 3 U[CR] U[CR]3 The patch has to be applied to the rom using a patching program (you 3 U[CR]U 3 can find one here http://rpgd.emulationworld.com/utils/snestl12.zip).3[CR]U[CR] U 3 If necessary, add a header to the rom first (with that same[CR]program).3 U[CR] U 3 3 U[CR] U 3 Next, use the program to apply 1 of the[CR]patches. Most of the time 3 U[CR] U 3 youll need to use the tope_gd7?.ips[CR]patch, but in some cases the 3 U[CR] U 3 rom isnt interleaved so youll need to[CR]use the tope_dx2?.ips patch 3 U[CR] U 3 instead. Do not apply all patches! 3[CR]U[CR] U 3 3 U[CR] U 3 If the first patch doesnt work, try the second patch but[CR]use the 3 U[CR] U 3 original rom (not the one you just patched). 3 U[CR] U 3 3[CR]U[CR] U 3 3 U[CR] U 3 Known Bugs 3 U[CR] U 3 ~~~~~~~~~~ 3 U[CR] U 3 Savestates[CR]created with emulators and copiers using a previous 3 U[CR] U 3 of the[CR]translation will not always work. This isnt really a bug, 3 U[CR] U 3 its just[CR]a side effect of the translation process. 3 U[CR] U 3 SRAM files (save games)[CR]will always work between different versions, 3 U[CR] U 3 however, we suggest[CR]you re-enter your characters names. 3 U[CR] U 3 3 U[CR] U 3 Some areas display[CR]corrupt graphics or text. This is because you 3 U[CR] U 3 have a corrupt rom,[CR]it has nothing to do with the translation patch! 3 U[CR] U 3 3 U[CR] U 3 If[CR]you find any other bugs, please let us know. 3 U[CR] U 3 3 U[CR] U 3 3 U[CR] U[CR]3 History 3 U[CR] U 3 ~~~~~~~ 3 U[CR] U 3 Interest for this project sparked[CR]after CyBeRGoth made some initial 3 U[CR] U 3 findings. Soon afterwards, the[CR]script was dumped by Dark Force in 3 U[CR] U 3 1997. The main text was[CR]translated during Chess Piece Face and 3 U[CR] U 3 Makokichis spring break in[CR]1999. The remaining text was translated 3 U[CR] U 3 in the following few[CR]weeks, then revisions began. The final script 3 U[CR] U 3 revisions, along[CR]with the new text compression scheme, were written 3 U[CR] U 3 in late 2000. 3[CR]U[CR] U 3 3 U[CR] U 3 3 U[CR] U 3 Words from the Authors 3 U[CR] U 3[CR]~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 3 U[CR] U 3 Chess Piece Face: 3 U[CR] U 3 I remember[CR]seeing a Tales of Phantasia cart a long time ago. 3 U[CR] U 3 I figured[CR]nothing could ever possibly compete with the fun I 3 U[CR] U 3 had playing[CR]Final Fantasy IV and VI. Man, I was wrong. I 3 U[CR] U 3 love this game. I was[CR]so excited when it began to work on 3 U[CR] U 3 ZSNES, and like many others,[CR]drooled over the thought of it 3 U[CR] U 3 being translated. Through a bizzare[CR]set of events (meeting 3 U[CR] U 3 makokichi at school and becoming friends,[CR]and getting set up 3 U[CR] U 3 to chat with Dark Force over the possibility of[CR]Tales 3 U[CR] U 3 translation) is a time in my life Ill never forget. 3 U[CR]U 3 makokichi and I worked our butts off over that spring break 3 U[CR] U 3 to[CR]translate the entire main text of the game together. I 3 U[CR] U 3 hope that[CR]everyone enjoys the game, and enjoys the 3 U[CR] U 3 translation - with a[CR]little luck, it wont be my last. 3 U[CR] U 3 As hard as Ive worked on this[CR]game, its totally inappropriate 3 U[CR] U 3 for me to take too much credit.[CR]All I did was love the game, 3 U[CR] U 3 respect the project, and pitch in[CR]when and where I could. 3 U[CR] U 3 makokichi definitely deserves the most[CR]credit in the 3 U[CR] U 3 translation, and Dark Force deserves more credit[CR]than anyone 3 U[CR] U 3 for the whole project. Its his baby, and he worked his[CR]ass 3 U[CR] U 3 off for it even when he was so frustrated with the project, 3[CR]U[CR] U 3 and I have nothing but the utmost respect for the guy. Hes 3 U[CR] U[CR]3 damn nigh impossible to please sometimes, but thats only 3 U[CR] U 3 because[CR]he expects the nothing but the best from himself and 3 U[CR] U 3 his team. 3[CR]U[CR] U 3 Lastly, a huge thank you is deserved for everyone else who 3 U[CR] U[CR]3 helped out, supported, e-mailed or whatever to the team. 3 U[CR] U 3 It is[CR]appreciated, even if sometimes you dont get an e-mail 3 U[CR] U 3 back. The[CR]game being translated is thanks enough for me, but 3 U[CR] U 3 the "good job"s[CR]and the "you guys rule"s are icing on the cake. 3 U[CR] U 3 3 U[CR] U 3 Dark[CR]Force: 3 U[CR] U 3 A long time ago, I saw a reference to Tales of Phantasia in[CR]some 3 U[CR] U 3 gaming magazine. The game was bigger than most Neo Geo carts[CR]of the 3 U[CR] U 3 time and it had real voices. It seemed amazing for an SNES[CR]game and 3 U[CR] U 3 as I expected it would never come out over here. 3 U[CR]U 3 I followed SNES emulation from the very start, once it got to the 3 U[CR]U 3 point where many commercial games were emulated, I went hunting for 3[CR]U[CR] U 3 ToP. Needless to say it didnt work at the time. From my days in the[CR]3 U[CR] U 3 console scene, I had come across a ToP patch by PopC0rn, which 3[CR]U[CR] U 3 removed the intro (which used extended mapping which wasnt[CR]emulated)3 U[CR] U 3 from the game allowing it to run on a 32mb copier. This[CR]meant the 3 U[CR] U 3 patched rom should also work on an emulator. Though only[CR]the sound 3 U[CR] U 3 menu worked with the patched rom, it was still amazing[CR]to see it 3 U[CR] U 3 being emulated. 3 U[CR] U 3 I then developed an interest[CR]for seeing it getting fully emulated. I 3 U[CR] U 3 knew it would work on a[CR]64mb GameDoctor, so I sought out people who 3 U[CR] U 3 had those copiers and[CR]got them to run various tests in an attempt to 3 U[CR] U 3 figure out what the[CR]GameDoctor was doing that emulators werent. 3 U[CR] U 3 UnaFarmer turned out[CR]to be the most helpful. With help from F.H, we 3 U[CR] U 3 figured out the[CR]memory mapping scheme and passed it on to zsKnight. 3 U[CR] U 3 By then,[CR]zsKnight had already figured out half the mapping on his 3 U[CR] U 3 own. We[CR]gave him the missing piece and then ToP instantly became 3 U[CR] U 3 emulated.[CR]The info was then shared with other emulators. The main 3 U[CR] U 3 problem[CR]was that the only ToP roms around came from a GameDoctor, 3 U[CR] U 3 and the[CR]way a GD interleaves a 48mb rom is completely fucked up. Had 3 U[CR] U 3 we[CR]started with a rom from a Super Wildcard (non-interleaved), ToP 3 U[CR] U 3[CR]probably would have been emulated a lot sooner. Around the same time,3 U[CR] U[CR]3 right before ToP was emulated, FanWen showed up and offered his 3 U[CR] U 3[CR]knowledge on ToPs mapping and a rom dumped from a Super Wildcard. 3 U[CR] U 3[CR]An interleaved rom is a pain in the ass to hack, so I had only been 3 U[CR] U[CR]3 working with the rom FanWen sent me. Yet all the roms on the net 3 U[CR] U 3[CR]were GD dumps, so I decided to release the uninterleaved rom. 3 U[CR] U 3 That[CR]is why we have the problem of interleaved and non-interleaved 3 U[CR] U 3 ToP[CR]roms and patches. 3 U[CR] U 3 Now that ToP was emulated, I thought why not[CR]translate it as well. 3 U[CR] U 3 I didnt start seriously looking at it until[CR]after CyBeRGoth started 3 U[CR] U 3 his hack on it. My original intention then[CR]was just to help him out. 3 U[CR] U 3 I was lucky to team up with Chess and[CR]Mako. They did the fastest 3 U[CR] U 3 translations Id ever seen. An rpg[CR]script in just 1 week! Chess was 3 U[CR] U 3 a really great person to work[CR]with. We shared the same consideration 3 U[CR] U 3 towards translating and[CR]agreed on many things. We disagreed on some, 3 U[CR] U 3 but who doesnt? The[CR]quality of the storyline can be credited to 3 U[CR] U 3 Chess. He revised the[CR]script 3 times over to make sure it delivered 3 U[CR] U 3 the best overall[CR]story. I doubt Namco could have done as good a job. 3 U[CR] U 3 I felt a[CR]perfect hack was needed to suit a great script. The hacking 3 U[CR] U 3 wasnt[CR]easy, it was a learning experience for me in some ways. 3 U[CR] U 3 Anyone who[CR]thinks this game isnt hard to hack, hasnt dug deep 3 U[CR] U 3 enough. Sure,[CR]individual bits may seem simple, but coordinating all 3 U[CR] U 3 the hacks to[CR]work together, combined with variable width font, a new 3 U[CR] U 3[CR]compression scheme, reorganized memory management and a multilingual 3 U[CR] U[CR]3 system, is no simple task. 3 U[CR] U 3 The thing keeping the project alive[CR]was enjoyment of the work. Once 3 U[CR] U 3 the work wasnt fun anymore, we[CR]released the old beta patch so that 3 U[CR] U 3 people would send us[CR]encouragement in order to help us get back on 3 U[CR] U 3 track. 3 U[CR] U 3[CR]The multilingual translations, for example, are a result of the fan 3 U[CR] U[CR]3 support. Had there not been such strong support from people all over 3 U[CR]U 3 the world, we wouldnt be involved in any language other than 3 U[CR] U 3[CR]English. So thanks to everyone who supported us over the years. 3 U[CR] U 3 3[CR]U[CR] U 3 3 U[CR] U 3 Credits 3 U[CR] U 3 ~~~~~~~ 3 U[CR] U 3 Programming:[CR]Dark Force 3 U[CR] U 3 English Translation: Makokichi and Chess Piece Face 3[CR]U[CR] U 3 Graphics Editing: Chess Piece Face and Dark Force 3 U[CR] U 3 3[CR]U[CR] U 3 3 U[CR] U 3 Special Thanks 3 U[CR] U 3 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 3 U[CR] U 3[CR]CyBeRGoth - for all his findings and help 3 U[CR] U 3 F.H - for his snes9x mod[CR]used to debug ToP 3 U[CR] U 3 zsKnight - for lots of great help 3 U[CR] U 3[CR]LordTech - for the opening quote text image and his snes9x mods 3 U[CR] U 3[CR]Neill Corlett - for very useful information on many different things 3 U[CR] U[CR]3 Forte - for his excellent beta testing 3 U[CR] U 3 Dantares - also for his[CR]excellent beta testing 3 U[CR] U 3 Impulse69 - for his beta testing 3 U[CR] U[CR]3 Gogeta75 - for his thorough bug reports and testing 3 U[CR] U 3 Disnesquick[CR]- for swapping info with us from his ToP project 3 U[CR] U 3 FanWen - for his[CR]ToP rom and support 3 U[CR] U 3 And everyone else who has supported us 3 U[CR]U 3 3 U[CR] U 3 Greets go out to all other romhackers and translators out[CR]there. 3 U[CR] U 3 3 U[CR] U 3 3 U[CR] U 3 Expect to see more ToP translation[CR]patches for other languages 3 U[CR] U 3 available soon! 3 U[CR] U 3 _/\\__ 3[CR]U[CR] U 3 / \/_ 3 U[CR] U 3 ,-----------------------------------------O---(O O[CR]\/_----. 3 U[CR] U 3 | o (___/ \/_ | 3 U[CR] U 3 | Visit DeJap at: (^^\\_/ \/_[CR]| 3 U[CR] U 3 | &lt;__________&gt; | 3 U[CR] U 3 | http://dejap.zsnes.com | 3 U[CR]U 3 `---------------------------------------------------------- 3 U[CR] U 3 3[CR]U[CR] U[CR]AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAU U[CR]ssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss</plot>

The garbage item bug 3 U[CR] U 3 caused by[CR]sorting has been fixed. However, if you have a garbage 3 U[CR] U 3 item in[CR]your inventory already, this new patch wont get rid of it, 3 U[CR] U 3 youll[CR]just have to sell it. Also, it has been confirmed that the 3 U[CR] U 3 display[CR]of corrupt graphics at certain points in the game, is due 3 U[CR] U 3 to a[CR]corrupt rom and not the translation patch. As with the last 3 U[CR] U 3 patch,[CR]dont expect all save states to work with the new version, 3 U[CR] U 3 instead,[CR]save your game to a save game slot and reload it using the 3 U[CR] U 3 new[CR]patch. Enjoy. 3 U[CR] U 3 3 U[CR] U 3 3 U[CR] U 3 Release Information 3 U[CR]U 3 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 3 U[CR] U 3 Is this really the final? Yes! Every bit[CR]of Japanese we have come 3 U[CR] U 3 across in the game has been dealt with,[CR]with the sole exception of 3 U[CR] U 3 the Japanese voices. There are no plans[CR]to do any sort of dubbing. 3 U[CR] U 3 As far as the translation goes, this is[CR]the final patch. As far as 3 U[CR] U 3 special features are concerned, were[CR]not quite done with it yet. 3 U[CR] U 3 This patch can be considered a final,[CR]and anything new after this 3 U[CR] U 3 would be considered a bonus release.[CR]This patch is also a beta. We 3 U[CR] U 3 expect many bugs to be reported[CR]after this release, which we will 3 U[CR] U 3 fix before releasing a bonus[CR]patch.

This[CR]meant the 3 U[CR] U 3 patched rom should also work on an emulator. Though only[CR]the sound 3 U[CR] U 3 menu worked with the patched rom, it was still amazing[CR]to see it 3 U[CR] U 3 being emulated. 3 U[CR] U 3 I then developed an interest[CR]for seeing it getting fully emulated. I 3 U[CR] U 3 knew it would work on a[CR]64mb GameDoctor, so I sought out people who 3 U[CR] U 3 had those copiers and[CR]got them to run various tests in an attempt to 3 U[CR] U 3 figure out what the[CR]GameDoctor was doing that emulators werent. 3 U[CR] U 3 UnaFarmer turned out[CR]to be the most helpful. With help from F.H, we 3 U[CR] U 3 figured out the[CR]memory mapping scheme and passed it on to zsKnight. 3 U[CR] U 3 By then,[CR]zsKnight had already figured out half the mapping on his 3 U[CR] U 3 own. We[CR]gave him the missing piece and then ToP instantly became 3 U[CR] U 3 emulated.[CR]The info was then shared with other emulators. The main 3 U[CR] U 3 problem[CR]was that the only ToP roms around came from a GameDoctor, 3 U[CR] U 3 and the[CR]way a GD interleaves a 48mb rom is completely fucked up. Had 3 U[CR] U 3 we[CR]started with a rom from a Super Wildcard (non-interleaved), ToP 3 U[CR] U 3[CR]probably would have been emulated a lot sooner. Around the same time,3 U[CR] U[CR]3 right before ToP was emulated, FanWen showed up and offered his 3 U[CR] U 3[CR]knowledge on ToPs mapping and a rom dumped from a Super Wildcard. 3 U[CR] U 3[CR]An interleaved rom is a pain in the ass to hack, so I had only been 3 U[CR] U[CR]3 working with the rom FanWen sent me. Yet all the roms on the net 3 U[CR] U 3[CR]were GD dumps, so I decided to release the uninterleaved rom. 3 U[CR] U 3 That[CR]is why we have the problem of interleaved and non-interleaved 3 U[CR] U 3 ToP[CR]roms and patches. 3 U[CR] U 3 Now that ToP was emulated, I thought why not[CR]translate it as well. 3 U[CR] U 3 I didnt start seriously looking at it until[CR]after CyBeRGoth started 3 U[CR] U 3 his hack on it. My original intention then[CR]was just to help him out. 3 U[CR] U 3 I was lucky to team up with Chess and[CR]Mako. They did the fastest 3 U[CR] U 3 translations Id ever seen. An rpg[CR]script in just 1 week! Chess was 3 U[CR] U 3 a really great person to work[CR]with. We shared the same consideration 3 U[CR] U 3 towards translating and[CR]agreed on many things. We disagreed on some, 3 U[CR] U 3 but who doesnt? The[CR]quality of the storyline can be credited to 3 U[CR] U 3 Chess. He revised the[CR]script 3 times over to make sure it delivered 3 U[CR] U 3 the best overall[CR]story. I doubt Namco could have done as good a job. 3 U[CR] U 3 I felt a[CR]perfect hack was needed to suit a great script. The hacking 3 U[CR] U 3 wasnt[CR]easy, it was a learning experience for me in some ways. 3 U[CR] U 3 Anyone who[CR]thinks this game isnt hard to hack, hasnt dug deep 3 U[CR] U 3 enough. Sure,[CR]individual bits may seem simple, but coordinating all 3 U[CR] U 3 the hacks to[CR]work together, combined with variable width font, a new 3 U[CR] U 3[CR]compression scheme, reorganized memory management and a multilingual 3 U[CR] U[CR]3 system, is no simple task. 3 U[CR] U 3 The thing keeping the project alive[CR]was enjoyment of the work. Once 3 U[CR] U 3 the work wasnt fun anymore, we[CR]released the old beta patch so that 3 U[CR] U 3 people would send us[CR]encouragement in order to help us get back on 3 U[CR] U 3 track. 3 U[CR] U 3[CR]The multilingual translations, for example, are a result of the fan 3 U[CR] U[CR]3 support. Had there not been such strong support from people all over 3 U[CR]U 3 the world, we wouldnt be involved in any language other than 3 U[CR] U 3[CR]English.

A date which passed into translation history.[CR]Seiken Densetsu 3[CR](Secret of Mana 2) has been translated 100%[CR]and a patch has been released[CR]by Neill Corlett, Lina, Nuku[CR]and Som2Freak. It was also the same date the[CR]Tenchi Muyo RPG[CR]translation was born, with all the hype and feedback[CR]our[CR]translators received they quickly moved to work in this evil[CR]game.[CR]It only took one week, yes you read right, just one [CR]week for the script to[CR]be fully translated. And guided by the[CR]amazing hacker TheGun, the game was[CR]on its way to get released[CR]in no time. However this wasnt the fate for this[CR]promising[CR]translation project. Two weeks after the translations[CR]birth[CR]the main hacker for the project TheGun disappears, leaving[CR]his[CR]great work behind, a buggy patch that would cause havoc[CR]to Linas group for[CR]the following 9 months. The patch, as it[CR]was by the time, had the main[CR]translated dialogue inserted and[CR]a big evil text bug that haunted the[CR]battle windows. And to make[CR]the story short, the text bug continued its[CR]evil ways for almost[CR]8 months, when Lina`chan showed it who was the hacker[CR]and who[CR]the hacked! ^^; However the text bug hasnt been[CR]completely[CR]destroyed. As it still resides in some, but little, parts in[CR]the[CR]game. Why do they release this 98% patch? Frankly, because it[CR]has[CR]been very tiring and stressful all this time. So to releive[CR]some pressure,[CR]we decide to release this complete-buggy but playable[CR]patch into public[CR]circulation. I hope this is as good as our other[CR]translations and we seek[CR]to make you, the player, happy. ^.^[CR]Hugs and candy from the translation[CR]team,[CR]Lina`chan.[CR]____________________________________________________________[CR]3.

It[CR]is [CR]the ultimate baseball simulation youve dreamed of."[CR]Ultra Baseball[CR]Jitsumeiban (or Real Names Version) is the third game released in [CR]the[CR]Ultra Baseball Series. The first two games were released in the US under the[CR]titles of "Baseball Simulator 1,000".[CR]The Baseball games are unique as[CR]they allow players to fully edit and automate [CR]entire leagues and seasons.[CR]Additionally its the optional "super power" [CR]Ultra League that gives[CR]players the unique ability to well....play some very [CR]wacky[CR]baseball![CR]-Ultra Baseball: released in 1989 for the NES as "Baseball[CR]Simulator 1,000".[CR]-Super Ultra Baseball: released in 1991 for the SNES as[CR]"Super Baseball Simulator 1,000".[CR]-Ultra Baseball Jitsumeiban: released in[CR]1992 for the SNES in Japan only. This is [CR]basically Super Ultra Baseball w/[CR]real names (Jitsumeiban means Real Names Version). [CR]The graphics and sound[CR]are slightly better, and there is a new pennant option but [CR]this obviously[CR]uses the same engine. [CR]-Super Ultra Baseball 2: released in 1994 for the[CR]SNES in Japan only. Culture Brain [CR]planned to release this title as "Super[CR]Baseball Simulator 1,000 2" but canceled shortly [CR]after. This game uses a[CR]new engine and sports more features - yes this project is in the[CR]works[CR]too![CR]-Ultra Baseball Jitsumeiban 2: Same engine as SUBB2, but with real[CR]players and some [CR]additional features. Most of this game has been[CR]translated into English by Tuffy da Bubba[CR]and is currently being revised[CR]and completed along w/ SUBB2. [CR]-Ultra Baseball Jitsumeiban 3: 1995, new[CR]engine, completely players even have numbers on[CR]their jerseys.[CR]-Pro[CR]Yakyuu Star: 1996, same engine as UBBJ3 but cartoon mode only and no ultra[CR]powers.[CR]3.[CR]Controls[CR]================================================================================[CR]We[CR]released a full PDF manual for UBBJ that you can download.[CR]KEY[CR]representation for each button:[CR] Y = Y button (pink)[CR] X = X button[CR](pink)[CR] B = B button (dark purple)[CR] A = A button (dark purple)[CR] L = L[CR]button (gray, top left)[CR] R = R button (gray, top right)[CR] Control Pad =[CR]directional pad (black)[CR] START = start button (black))[CR] SELECT = select[CR]button (black) [CR] ______________[CR]/Menu[CR]Controls/[CR]-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=[CR] START - advances through most[CR]menus[CR] A - confirms selection[CR] B - rejects selection[CR]Control Pad -[CR]navigates through menus[CR]________[CR]/Batting/[CR]-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=[CR] START - calls[CR]time[CR] X - picks power up (if available)[CR] A - swings bat[CR] Y - tells[CR]runner (on base) to steal[CR]Control Pad - moves batter in box, affects where[CR]bat hits ball[CR]/Pitching/[CR]-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=[CR] START - calls[CR]time[CR] X - picks power up (if available)[CR] A - tosses pitch[CR] Y -[CR]pitcher steps off rubber, pick off move[CR]Control Pad - moves pitcher on[CR]white rubber (horizontally)[CR] - also affects velocity, stamina used per[CR]pitch, and direction[CR]4.[CR]Issues[CR]================================================================================[CR]-Some[CR]text is cut short or abbreviated due to space restrictions.

Translation Notes[CR]================================================================================[CR]Jitsumeiban[CR]as the title suggests is the "Real Player Version" thus this game used[CR]real players from NPB.

    <plot>I can clearly say, without any doubt, that this is the greatest game ever. To[CR]hell with MGS, move over SotN, Umihara Kawase is the game of choice for me,[CR]thank you very much. And why, you ask? Because you're a girl with a fishing[CR]line for a weapon, that's why! All the enemies are fish, and you have to hook[CR]on to them and reel them in! Pretty cool eh? Well the coolest part is that[CR]your fishing line is also used as a grappling hook. So you can swing around[CR]and do all kinds of fun crazy things. Of course, this makes for some pretty[CR]endless replay value. It's even fun to die, for reasons that just can not be[CR]explained. I always laugh maniacally when she dies, because it's just so much[CR]FUN, and it makes this hilarious "sploosh" sound when she falls in the water![CR]Of course it kind of sucks when you've wasted all your lives goofing around.[CR]So, for the benefit of our loyal visitors, here is a [ZSNES CHT[CR]file](http://donut.parodius.com/translations/snes/patches/umihar~1.cht) I[CR]made, which allows for infinite lives. Now you can screw around all you[CR]want![CR]Read Me:[CR]Umihara Kawase translation patch v0.90[CR]http://sa-[CR]two.yuudachi.net/[CR]Contents[CR]================================================================================[CR]1.[CR]Patch History[CR]2. About Umihara Kawase[CR]3. Controls[CR]4. Issues[CR]5.[CR]What doesnt this patch do?[CR]6. Why, after all this time, are you[CR]rereleasing such a minor translation?[CR]7. Patching Note[CR]A. Credits and[CR]Thanks[CR]B. Reminder[CR]1. Patch[CR]History[CR]================================================================================[CR]v0.90[CR]- 2/6/2007[CR]- Replay system completely translated.[CR]- Game over graphic[CR]translated.[CR]- Title screen *not* translated. See below for details.[CR]-[CR]Idiocy removed.[CR]- Lets forget the previous versions ever existed.[CR]2.[CR]About Umihara[CR]Kawase[CR]================================================================================[CR]Umihara[CR]Kawase is a platform game that was only officially released in Japan[CR]and[CR]enjoyed a sequel on the PlayStation. The title is derived from a[CR]Japanese[CR]cooking idiom meaning "sea fish are fat in the belly, river fish[CR]are fat in[CR]the back".[CR]The game is pretty simple. You control a girl with[CR]a rubber fishing line[CR]which you can use to attack and catch most of the[CR]various enemies in the[CR]game. However, its main use is to navigate through[CR]the levels. You can hook[CR]onto any solid surface, and mastering swinging[CR]from surface to surface is the[CR]key to getting far in this game.[CR]The game[CR]comes with an option to watch a replay of your progress once you[CR]lose. This[CR]feature is suprisingly sophisticated; you can store replays in[CR]several[CR]files and save them to the games memory. Its this feature that[CR]has been[CR]translated.[CR]True, in this day and age, this feature has been completely[CR]superceded by[CR]the great ease of making gameplay clips and sharing with them[CR]others on[CR]the Internet, but the reason this translation was made was to[CR]bring attention[CR]to a rather unique and enjoyable game.[CR]3.[CR]Controls[CR]================================================================================[CR]D-Pad[CR]: Move/Reel in line (up)/Loosen line (down)[CR]A : Jump[CR]B : Throw fishing[CR]line[CR]X : Jump[CR]Y : Throw fishing line[CR]L : Scroll screen left[CR]R :[CR]Scroll screen left[CR]Start : Pause[CR]Select: Not used.[CR]Operating the[CR]Replay System:[CR]First, you need something to replay. For the sake of this[CR]demonstration,[CR]play the game, lose all your lives, and return the main[CR]menu.[CR]Go into the replay menu, and select the option "Save".[CR]The save[CR]menu will list 10 files, representing the 10 lives you used.[CR]Theyre named[CR]FIELDxx, where xx is the number of the FIELD you died[CR]at. Anyway, pick a[CR]file and save it. Now, you can replay it.[CR]Leave the Save menu, and you can[CR]either Replay, Rename or Delete[CR]the file. I think its pretty self[CR]explanatory from there.[CR]4.[CR]Issues[CR]================================================================================[CR]None[CR]known at time of release.[CR]5. What doesnt this patch[CR]do?[CR]================================================================================[CR]The[CR]title screen is left in the original Japanese. I think it looks better[CR]that[CR]way, but if anyone feels like producing a *good* English version,[CR]Ill[CR]gladly incorporate it into this translation.[CR]6. Why, after all this[CR]time, are you rereleasing such a minor[CR]translation?[CR]================================================================================[CR]Umihara[CR]Kawase was my very first contribution to the translation scene, and[CR]its[CR]nostalgic for me. However, I also produced this translation when I was[CR]a[CR]stupid high schooler, and it ended up being that I couldnt think back on[CR]it[CR]without cringing in embarassment. One thing that particularly bothered[CR]me[CR]was that I had altered the TNN logo graphic at the start of the game to[CR]a[CR]short message, and another was the really crappy hand-written "The End!"[CR]on[CR]the Game Over screen. I decided I couldnt put this translation on my[CR]current[CR]site without fixing this, and I thought maybe I could at least get[CR]this out[CR]there so that eventually only a few people will know that I was a[CR]dumb high[CR]school kid once.[CR]7. Patching[CR]Note[CR]================================================================================[CR]Considering[CR]that not that many people will be playing this compared to titles[CR]like[CR]Tales of Phantasia or Shin Megami Tensei, I dont think I have to be[CR]very[CR]verbose here.[CR]You should know, however, that this patch was made[CR]for a ROM /WITHOUT/ a header.[CR]The size of an Umihara Kawase ROM without a[CR]header is 1,048,576 bytes.[CR]A. Credits and[CR]thanks[CR]================================================================================[CR]Translation/hacking:[CR]satsu[CR]Special thanks to:[CR]Kent Keltner, who brought this game to my[CR]attention.[CR]Akimaru, who helped me with some difficult parts of the[CR]translation as[CR]I didnt actually speak Japanese when the translation was[CR]first made.[CR]B.[CR]Reminder[CR]================================================================================[CR]Please[CR]DO NOT ask me or anyone else involved with this translation for a[CR]copy of[CR]the ROM.[CR]The distribution of this work as a prepatched ROM is strictly[CR]forbidden.[CR]This patch must also be distributed with this readme[CR]file.[CR]Copyright 2007 satsu, except for the bits I didnt do which are[CR]copyright[CR]to the people who did them.</plot>

In this release, these[CR]issues[CR]have been fixed - the font routine should work fine on a real Super[CR]NES[CR]system, and the script has been given a marvelous facelift by[CR]Deuce,[CR]the local Ys junkie.[CR]November 28, 2013 - Version 2.10[CR]release[CR]--In-game terminology standardized against Memories of[CR]Celceta[CR]--Fixed a few instance of too-long strings corrupting the game[CR]background[CR]--Fixed several other minor text-related bugs[CR]February 3,[CR]2007 - Version 2.00 release[CR]--Fixes font print on real[CR]hardware[CR]--Complete script rewrite[CR]March 31, 2000 - Initial version 0.99[CR]release[CR]---------------[CR]3.Patch Credits[CR]---------------[CR]THE YS IV[CR]TEAM[CR]Gideon Zhi - Project leader, lead romhacker, assembly hacker[CR]Deuce[CR]- Script edit/translation[CR]Shimarisu - Initial Translator[CR]LordTech -[CR]Assembly work (old VWF, compression)[CR]g8z et al. - VWF fix[CR]SPECIAL[CR]THANKS[CR]Dark Force - Pointed out some problems with the VWF[CR]TheFreak -[CR]Helped with some names of Mineans and Lancers ^_^[CR]Toma - Provided the font[CR]that is used in the game.[CR]--------------[CR]4.Known[CR]Issues[CR]--------------[CR]--The font did not print properly on the "special"[CR]background,[CR] so I just disabled it. It was ugly as sin, anyway.[CR]Please[CR]report any other bugs, spelling errors, and[CR]such on The Pantheon[CR](http://donut.parodius.com/agtp)[CR]Screenshots are preferred, as are (ZSNES[CR]format) savestates.[CR]--------------------------[CR]6.Application[CR]Instructions[CR]--------------------------[CR]If using ZSNES, make sure that[CR]the patch has the same name as your ROM.[CR]In other words, if your ROM is[CR]called "ys4.smc" make sure the patch[CR]is "ys4.ips" okay? If youre using a[CR]Mac, a Mac IPS patcher is[CR]available. Check the AGTP Links page. If youre[CR]using a copier, you[CR]probably already know how to patch the ROM :) Be sure[CR]to apply the[CR]patch to a clean copy of the ROM, and make sure your ROM DOES[CR]NOT HAVE[CR]A HEADER!. If you right-click the ROM and select Properties,[CR]it[CR]should read "Size: 1.50 MB (1,572,864 bytes)". SNESTool will remove[CR]all[CR]of your headers for you easily, and you can find it[CR]at[CR]http://www.romhacking.net[CR]In the Utilities section, simply search for[CR]snestool.[CR]An easy way to tell if the game has a header or not is that if[CR]you[CR]apply the patch and the game does not boot, your game very likely[CR]does[CR]not have a[CR]header.[CR]-----------------[CR]6.Troubleshooting[CR]-----------------[CR]--If[CR]the game does not run at all, read the above section on[CR] application[CR]instructions (specifically on header removal.)[CR] Make sure your ROM is not[CR]read-only when you remove its header.[CR] Also make sure that if you[CR]previously hard-patched the ROM and[CR] the game crashes as described, you[CR]will need to re-apply the[CR] patch a clean, Japanese original[CR]ROM.[CR]-------------[CR]7.How to Play[CR]-------------[CR]DEFAULT[CR]CONTROLS:[CR]ARROW KEYS - Move Adol[CR]A BUTTON - Accept a choice.[CR]B BUTTON[CR]- Cancel out of a menu.[CR]Y BUTTON - Use an item.[CR]X BUTTON - Cast magic,[CR]when standing still.[CR]L/R BUTTON - Not used.[CR]To talk to a villager, just[CR]walk into them and conversation will begin.[CR]COMBAT[CR]Combat in Ys IV is[CR]not like combat in most action-RPGs. Be sure youre[CR]viewing this document in[CR]a fixed-width font before reading the next[CR]section.[CR]In order to do[CR]damage to an enemy, you have to run through it. But if[CR]you ram it head-on,[CR]youll take damage instead (unless youre really[CR]strong.) Instead, run into[CR]the enemy half a "block" to the left or[CR]right of it.[CR]EXAMPLES[CR]Let us[CR]say that "EE" is the enemy, and "AA" is Adol.[CR]GOOD:[CR] EE[CR]AA[CR] EE[CR]AA[CR]BAD:[CR] EE[CR] AA[CR]Its kinda hard to describe... but its really neat[CR]once you get used[CR]to it. Fighting bosses is pretty much the same, except[CR]that the bosses[CR]wont hurt you unless you actually stand still on top of[CR]them. So long[CR]as youre moving and you dont get hit by any of the boss[CR]attacks,[CR]youll be fine.</plot>
