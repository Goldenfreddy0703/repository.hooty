		<emu_comment>ReDump Sega Dreamcast list.[CR]The Dreamcast is a 128-bit video game console which was released by Sega in late 1998 in Japan and from September 1999 in other territories. It was the first entry in the sixth generation of video game consoles, preceding Sony's PlayStation 2, Microsoft's Xbox and the Nintendo GameCube. Dreamcast sales were positive during launch, but because of the strong pressure from rival PlayStation 2, Dreamcast sales decreased, and Sega finally discontinued the Dreamcast in March 2001 and withdrew entirely from the console hardware business, making it the company's final console.[CR]Developer:  Sega[CR]Manufacturer:  Sega[CR]CPU:  200 MHz Hitachi SH4 RISC[CR]Memory:  RAM 16 MB, GPU 8 MB[CR]Graphics:  100 MHz PowerVR2 CLX2[CR]Sound:  Yamaha AICA Sound Processor with a 32-Bit ARM7 RISC CPU[CR]Display:  640 x 480[CR]Media:  Disc[CR]Max Controllers:  4</emu_comment>

        <plot>102 Dalmatians is a 3D platformer where you become a courageous Dalmatian puppy, who must rescue your family and friends from the clutches of Cruella De Vil. Disney's 102 Dalmatians: Puppies to the Rescue features beloved characters from 101 Dalmatians and new characters based on the upcoming 102 Dalmatians live action movie.[CR]The game follows the films' storyline loosely. The player can choose the role of one of two dalmatians, Oddball or Domino, who are out in the backyard looking for treasure. It is not long before the player realizes that a toy found buried in a park was made at one of Cruella de Vil's toy factories; this alludes to the fact that Cruella's toy sales are down, which ultimately leads to the problem in the storyline. Facing financial ruin from lack of sales, Cruella sets an evil plan in motion - to reprogram her toys to capture any pets in sight. Oddball and Domino are the only puppies in their family who have not been captured when they return from the park. Their parents, Dottie and Dipstick, set out to rescue their puppies, commanding Oddball and Domino to stay home and 'be good.' The puppies do not listen, and are soon out on their biggest adventure yet - to save their brothers and sisters, and their parents who are captured along the way.</plot>

        <plot>The main purpose of the game is to make it to the finish line with the truck's cargo. Players are given a set amount of time, but can ram into special vans that will add three seconds to the timer. There are several characters to choose from, each with a unique truck and attributes.[CR]The game starts out in Key West and players travel across the United States, ending in San Francisco. After Stage 1, the game gives the player a choice of trailer. One trailer is harder to haul, but provides a bigger payoff while the other choice is easier to haul but provides a smaller payoff. Money is deducted from the total when the trailer is hit. Players can sound the truck's horn to make other cars on the road yield and slipstream behind large vehicles to gain a momentary speed boost.[CR]In addition to the time limit, players also compete with the "Lizard Tail", a rival trucker. Crossing the finish line before the Lizard Tail yields additional money. In between levels, players can park the truck in a mini game to earn more cash.</plot>

At such time, a murder occurs at the hospital and people start suffering from an unknown strange disease. The police investigation into it has been launched which yields many suspects and mysteries, and even more questions.[CR]Gameplay [CR]At its core, this is a visual novel adventure which determines the course of the story based on the choices you make.

        <plot>4 Wheel Thunder is the off-road racing sequel to the power-boat racing game Hydro Thunder.[CR]In this game, players race around two types of courses; huge outdoor tracks and smaller indoor tracks. All in all, there are 24 areas in which to race, including various day/night and rain/sunshine variations. The game includes the standard championship, practice race, and two player modes.[CR]The Thunder series of games is unique in that the key to winning the race lies not in careful steering and braking, instead focusing more in finding the boost power-ups that lie around the tracks. Each boost icon adds a few seconds of time to your boost meter. The player then can press a boost button to increase the speed of the truck dramatically. Without using boost power-ups, the player has no chance of winning a race.</plot>

        <plot>4x4 Evo is a racing game featuring real-life pickup trucks and SUV's. Actual trucks from manufacturers such as Chevrolet, Ford, Dodge, Nissan, Toyota and more are included.[CR]The actual racing game is based very heavily on Terminal Reality's Monster Truck Madness series of games, except with SUV's instead of monster trucks.[CR]One significant feature of 4x4 Evo is the online multi-player option. The Dreamcast, PC, and Macintosh versions can compete against each other in 4 player online races.[CR]In addition to the on-line mode of play, there is a single player career mode. The career mode gives you a small allotment of money with which to purchase a truck. You then can compete in races to earn more money for more trucks or performance parts for your current truck.</plot>

        <plot>90 minutes is a traditional action football game, featuring 7 leagues (England, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, plus an assortment of clubs from around the world) and national teams. While there are no team licenses, most players feature real names and there's also a player and team editor, allowing to change name and number of players, who's in each national team, as well as creating teams from scratch, including its players.[CR]Gameplay follows the norms of the genre - A to pass, B to throw a high lob, X to shoot, Y to change players, with the triggers to perform modifiers (though passes and lob shots) and sprint, although these can all be changed in the options. The player can also assign special tactics to each direction on the d-pad to adapt quickly according to the flow of the game.[CR]Game modes include the usual - World Championship (based on the world cup), as well as national leagues and cups (as well as a customizable cup), with secret teams waiting to be unlocked by those who win them, exhibition and training. Options are also the usual on these kind of games - change half lenght (3,5 or 10 minutes), opponent level and game speed. At gametime, players can also choose the weather, time of day, and between 10 cameras. There are six stadiums to choose from, inspired by venues such as the old Wembley Stadium, the Nou Camp or the ArenA in Amsterdam.</plot>

        <plot>Advanced Daisenryaku 2001 is a World War II strategy game, sequel to the game Advanced Daisenryaku: Europe no Arashi - Doitsu Dengeki Sakusen. Both games run on Sega's Dreamcast system. Advanced Daisenryaku 2001 fixed some bugs and moderately improved the graphics of Europe no Arashi and as such it is less of a sequel and more of a fix.</plot>

        <plot>The story in this game consists of two main parts. First part focusing on school days and a group of students who set out on a hiking trip in Japanese Alps. However, the protagonist of the story, Yuuichi Takawashi, dies in an accident during mountain climbing. But because of the reincarnation process of the soul, Yuuichi's memories are played. But in order to playback the memories of the soul, it is necessary to have someone in your heart who you really want to meet. And so the story flashback to the memories of high-school when you were in third year and play until the day of your accident. Second part start with Yuuichi waking up in a hospital. But not is his own body, but rather in that of whomever you made heroine in the first part of the story. Your soul is sort-of possessing that person's body. You want to tell people you know that you are still alive somehow, but because you are not really you, it appears to be rather difficult feat to achieve. But it is a matter of time when the soul decides to merge, and because two souls cannot forever occupy the same body, the one that doesn't merge will disappear, and if Yuuichi's soul merges, he will continue to live on in this body.[CR]This visual novel plays just as typically, you read through the text with static backgrounds and non-animated characters and occasionally make choices that may propel the story toward a certain direction. There are also unlockable CG scenes and background music which can be viewed from gallery.[CR]Dreamcast and PlayStation 2 ports feature some new characters and scenarios which are not present in PC version.</plot>

        <plot>Alien Front Online is a Dreamcast video game originally released for the console in 2001.[CR]In the game, players use armored vehicles to fight tense battles staged in large, interactive arenas. Players could choose which side they wished to fight for, the aliens or the human defenders of Earth, and could also choose one of three different vehicles to combat with; each having its own advantages and disadvantages. Although Alien Front was fully playable for one person, it was primarily designed as an online game in which up to 8 players (up to 4 on each side) could battle it out. Players move around the arena attempting to blast each other with their weaponry, while also looking for power-ups that will enhance their ability to wreak massive destruction. Typically, the game was played for a set number of minutes, after which the team with the most kills would be declared the winners. Being killed while playing the game had no serious consequences (you simply respawned in a different part of the area you were in), but it did reflect on your win/loss score.</plot>

        <plot>Set on October 31, 2001. Edward Carnby's best friend and partner, Charles Fiske, has been found dead off the coast of Shadow Island, a mysterious island near the coast of Massachusetts. Carnby's investigation quickly leads him to Frederick Johnson, who informs him of Fiske's search for three ancient tablets with the ability to unlock an incredible and dangerous power. Johnson pleads with Carnby to take the place of Fiske and reopen the investigation in order to recover the tablets. Carnby accepts and makes it his mission to find Fiske's killer. Johnson introduces Edward to Aline Cedrac, an intelligent, young university professor. She joins Edward to recover the missing tablets and assist Professor Obed Morton, who she believes to be her father. While flying over the coast of Shadow Island, Edward and Aline's plane comes under attack by an unknown creature. Edward and Aline both jump out of the plane and parachute to the ground, but are separated immediately. Edward lands in the dense forest just outside a manor, while Aline lands on the roof of said manor.</plot>

        <plot>The player takes a role of a young male assistant to the picture book writer who just went on a tour of Europe for an inspiration. You, on the other hand, desperately want to prove yourself in the area, but your inspiration is as dry as an empty well. So, you decide to take those three weeks of holidays to return to your hometown and give your best to come up with something solid or completely give up on wanting to become a picture book writer. Your hometown is a couple of hours from Tokyo by bullet train, though it is a rather rural area so it requires a switch to a more local train. Upon your arrival, you soon team up with Erina, an old friend of yours, and the two of you keep on exploring town, going places an meeting people. One night, walking alone in the woods, you get caught by the rain. Running to find a shelter, you stumble upon a small shrine. There, in front of your eyes, you see a flying silhouette which soon gets zapped by the thunder and falls down not far from where you are. Not sure what you saw really happened, you come outside and see a small fairy, down on the ground under the rain and with a wounded wing. You pick her up and tend to her wound. She quickly tests her fixed wings and flies away with a smile. As the morning comes, you look over town and has a sudden vision of an unknown place. Whatever happened to you granted you certain magical abilities you are not aware of.[CR]The game takes place in your hometown which represents reality, and a fantasy Layer world. In either world you can freely move around the map and talk to various characters you run along the way. Your hometown is split into six districts and different events and characters can be seen at different time of the day (morning, noon, evening, or night). When in Layer world, whenever important advance is being made, a battle scene which takes action on a separate combat arena will occur. The battle itself is real-time and consists of you trying to throw objects or use attacks against the boss. During adventure mode, when entering certain area from the map, the gameplay will resemble that of a regular visual novel with static backgrounds and character stills over it, varying in poses to emphasize their disposition. As dialogues are often short, dialogue choices are not used, but occasional actions you can perform are offered depending on the time and location.</plot>

        <plot>Armada is a video game that was released for the Sega Dreamcast in 1999. Earth has been destroyed by the unfathomable Armada, giant space aliens of unknown origin with unknown purpose. Fleeing in whatever was available, humanity took to the stars in a desperate attempt to survive. Eons later, humans have split into 6 distinct groups who maintain a shaky alliance against the Armada. An Asteroids-like RPG, Armada was a sci-fi shooter that allowed 1-4 players to fly about the universe, fighting the enemy, performing missions and improving their ship. The player would gather credits to buy power-ups for their ship, allowing them to voyage deeper into enemy territory, blow up ever more powerful Armada, and perform missions of increasing importance and danger as the alliance fights not only for answers as to why the Armada attack, but for their very lives.</plot>

For instance, "enhanced" asteroids merely has a static backdrop, whereas "enhanced" warlords is a complete graphical overhaul with new colors.

        <plot>A group of space pirates known as the Cosmo Gang is concocting an evil scheme, which involves smuggling rare fruits and using them for their own foul purposes. Two young mecha pilots, Riki and his sister Mami, board a giant mecha called Bangai-O, in order to confront the pirates in battle and foil their villainous plans.[CR]Bangai-O is a multi-directional shooter and a spiritual successor to Hover Attack. The player manoeuvres the titular mecha and shoots in eight directions. Two firing modes represent switching between the two pilots. Riki fires homing missiles, while Mami's shots bounce off walls. Enemies drop fruits upon defeat, which are equivalent to power-ups in other games. It is also possible to execute a special attack that consists of a burst of shots fired in all directions. Scoring successful combos (or increasing explosion count in the Dreamcast version) leads to higher-level power-ups.</plot>

        <plot>A group of space pirates known as the Cosmo Gang is concocting an evil scheme, which involves smuggling rare fruits and using them for their own foul purposes. Two young mecha pilots, Riki and his sister Mami, board a giant mecha called Bangai-O, in order to confront the pirates in battle and foil their villainous plans.[CR]Bangai-O is a multi-directional shooter and a spiritual successor to Hover Attack. The player manoeuvres the titular mecha and shoots in eight directions. Two firing modes represent switching between the two pilots. Riki fires homing missiles, while Mami's shots bounce off walls. Enemies drop fruits upon defeat, which are equivalent to power-ups in other games. It is also possible to execute a special attack that consists of a burst of shots fired in all directions. Scoring successful combos (or increasing explosion count in the Dreamcast version) leads to higher-level power-ups.</plot>

        <plot>A demo of CODE: Veronica was included with Biohazard 2 Value Plus on the [CR]Dreamcast to sell consumers on the minimally upgraded re-release of the [CR]original PlayStation game (actually ported from PC). The demo contained [CR]most of the first fifteen minutes of the game, along with all the cut-[CR]scenes that made it to the final game in that portion. [CR]The only change is that Claire is able to take the Gold Lugers from the [CR]display room in the Palace, compared to the final game, in which Steve [CR]takes them instead. Claire can take the Lugers to the door in the save [CR]room on the second floor, and unlock it by placing the Lugers onto [CR]there. In the final game, Claire could only do this after going through [CR]the Airport and Military Training Facility. The demo ends with Claire [CR]headed towards the Private Residence, and hearing Alexia laughing. [CR]The demo also contains a few music tracks from all the Biohazard games [CR]up to that point in 1999 (so it excludes Gun Survivor).</plot>

        <plot>Black/Mtrix Advanced is an enhanced version of Black/Matrix. The game is set in a world which is controlled by demons, who have defeated the angels after a prolonged war. You control Abel, an angel who serves a female demon master (which you choose among several available characters in the beginning of the game). You and your master develop deep feelings for each other, but then your master disappears, and you decide to find her at all costs.[CR]The Dreamcast release comes on 2 GDs (instead of the single CD of the original), and features many anime-style cutscenes that were not included in the Saturn version. Also, the story cutscenes which happen after the battle don't use the isometric battle engine any more, but are viewed from first-person perspective, with character portraits occupying a large portion of the screen. Other differences include the addition of two scenarios (12 instead of the original 10), a new difficulty level (Easy), different art for character portraits, several changes in battle locations, and new plot details.</plot>

        <plot>Bomberman Online brings gamers the same addictive battles as in other Bomberman games in the form of online multiplayer puzzles. Players progress through different levels attempting to destroy their opponents by strategically planting bombs and running for cover. Each playing field is constructed out of both destructible and indestructible walls, and it's up to you to position bombs in the right place at the right time. The action gets frantic as alliances and rivalries are made and then broken. Intense battles unfold online when you connect to the Internet and play other Bomberman Online users in Internet battle mode. The new screen-scroll option displays a larger map, making it possible for numerous players to skillfully battle it out at the same time. Five new stages and four new ways to play add to the fun, creating an endless chain reaction of unique and dramatic battles!</plot>

        <plot>A futuristic sci-fi shooter in which you play a test pilot strapped to the brand new RAIN combat simulator which allows you to remotely control fighters as they immerse themselves in the midst of enemy territory.[CR]The game is a side-scrolling shooter in which you control your ship and try to survive the onslaught of enemy attacks while you attempt to clear the levels. Weapon upgrades are based on collectible power-ups, but the game mostly relies on a power bar that fills as you destroy enemies and which allows you to unleash your super weapon at the expense of decreased normal firepower. The game also features a unique "border" system which involves three separate routes through each stage. You select the default route at the start of a level and when your ship is destroyed you get knocked down to the next "border", which features alternate backgrounds and enemy patterns. Only if you get knocked off the last border you lose the game.[CR]Uses completely polygonal graphics and features single player arcade, remix and practice modes through 6 enemy-infested stages, the last of which has four unique variations.</plot>

        <plot>Capcom vs. SNK 2: Mark of the Millennium 2001, known in Japan as Capcom vs. SNK 2: Millionaire Fighting 2001 (カプコン バーサス エス・エヌ・ケイ 2 ミリオネア ファイティング 2001 Kapukon bāsasu Esu-enu-kei Tsū: Mirionea Faitingu Tsū Sausando Wan?), is the sequel to the fighting game Capcom vs. SNK. It was originally released on NAOMI hardware in arcades. As in the original, players select a team of fighters from various Capcom and SNK games then fight other teams, winning each battle by defeating all the opponents from the other team.[CR]Aspects of the first game were tweaked, including the Ratio system. In contrast to the fixed system of the original, players can now freely select characters and assign each of them a number from one to four (or "Ratio") determining their relative strength, adding up to a maximum team ratio of four. Teams can now consist of a maximum of three characters, as opposed to four in the first game. Additional characters were added, including more characters from Capcom and SNK titles outside of the Street Fighter and King of Fighters series. The Groove system from Millennium Fight 2000 has been augmented to include four new systems of play based on various Capcom and SNK fighting games. In addition, the number of buttons has been increased from the Neo Geo standard of four to the six button system first seen in Capcom's Street Fighter.[CR]The game was initially ported to the Sega Dreamcast, followed by a version for the PlayStation 2. The GameCube and Xbox received an updated version titled Capcom vs. SNK 2 EO, with the "EO" referring to "Easy Operation", a game option intended for novices to the game. The PS2 version was later released on PlayStation Network in July 2013.[2]</plot>

        <plot>Seimadaisen" is a prequel to the first Castle Fantasia. The events of the game takes place 500 years before those of "Castle Fantasia", and tells the story of a two hundred year long religious war between the Inshiera Empire and the Ruushiera Republic. The Empire worships the God of Light and considers the republicans followers of an evil god. The army of the empire has seven holy squads, and you command a knight named Hyuui, the leader of one of them.[CR]"Seimadaisen" is a strategy RPG with erotic content. You fight on large battle screens, navigating your party in turn-based mode, attacking when enemies are in range. Enemies drop hearts when defeated, and collecting those hearts can heal you and raise your parameters. Between battles, there are parts in which you'll have conversations with girls and will be able to choose different answers, leading to different endings.</plot>

        <plot>his is a remake or "modernization" of the classic arcade shooter Centipede, originally released in arcades by Atari in 1980. This remake keeps some of the original game's shooter-style gameplay while mixing in more console-style exploration. Gameplay progresses through five "worlds": Weedom, Frostonia, Infernium, Enigma, and Evile. Players blast away at the classic centipedes, spiders, fleas, and scorpions while fighting new enemies like the mosquito, cockroach, and killer mushroom. A "classic" mode is also included, which allows players to play the classic game in a new "3D" isometric perspective.</plot>

        <plot>Chaos Field is a top-down space shooter similar in concept to the Gradius series, or Ikaruga. You control one of three ships, each with their own pilot and unique weapon systems. [CR]The game takes place over 5 phases, in each phase you face a number of boss battles. Unlike other games if this genre, almost the entire game is composed of boss battles, each boss requiring a different strategy to defeat. [CR]The game also uses a unique in-game difficulty adjuster. Called "fields", you can play in either Order or Chaos. Compared to Order, the Chaos Field offers you increased fire power and abilities, but also does the same for your enemies. Order Field is more relaxed on both sides. If you can play in the Chaos Field, you stand to gain substantially more points.</plot>

        <plot>Charge 'N Blast is a shooting game where you play as one of three marines who have to rid the earth of alien scum. The gameplay is similar to Cabal, you move left and right dodging enemies while charging up you weapons to blast them away.[CR]There are three different marines you can choose from, each with their own set of weapons. As usual there is the balanced character (Johnny Rock), a weaker but faster one (Pamela Hewitt) and a slower but stronger one (Nicholas Woods).[CR]You can choose to play in one player mode, time attack or two player mode. The missions are broken up into small areas where you have to kill all enemies before moving on to the next area. Each mission ends with a boss character such as a giant insect or a Godzilla-like monster.[CR]Use the X, Y or B buttons to choose a weapon, press A to charge and shoot and aim with analog stick. There are different types of weapons that can be used on the different types of enemies. For example the single missiles for far away targets and torpedoes for underwater enemies.[CR]You can fire your weapon continuously, but this doesn't do as much damage compared to a fully charged shot. Charging each shot means you have to aim a little more carefully, but you'll especially need this in the later levels. You can dodge enemies with the L and R buttons.</plot>

        <plot>Christmas Seaman is a festive upgrade to Seaman. It was released exclusively in Japan and was only available between 16 and 24 December 1999. Like the original Seaman it gives you the chance to raise your own pet, starting with nothing but a tiny egg? How about raise him to be a smart-mouthed, viper-tongued companion who listens to you and gives you a dose of smart-ass advice? Look no further than the lab of Dr. Jean Paul Gassé, who left you a few eggs from the mysterious creature known as the Seaman. Now you've got the chance to raise your very own Seaman. Talk to him, tickle him, feed him...just don't rub him the wrong way, or you'll end up with an angry pet and a big headache.</plot>

        <plot>ChuChu Rocket is an action puzzler, designed predominantly as a multi-player game. You have indirect control over mice, and must guide them to the safety of a rocket, and away from a cat. You do this by placing arrows on the ground, which they will follow. The multi-player game is a frantic all-against-all duel, in which each player's mice will only follow instructions of their own colour. You can play this mode on your own against CPU opponents, or take on a series of predefined puzzles</plot>

        <plot>Cleopatra Fortune is a 1997 falling-block puzzle game featuring an anime Egyptian theme. Groups of stones and gems of different shapes fall from the top of a well. Gems can be cleared by enclosing them within a group of stones, and stones can be cleared by making complete rows from them. Blocks will fall when those under them are cleared, which can create chains for more points.[CR]The game includes three different play modes. First is a standard endless mode where play continues until the player is overwhelmed by the blocks. Second is a versus mode for two players. Last is a puzzle mode where the player is given a set field, a set sequence of drops, and a specific goal such as clearing all the gems or achieving a chain of a certain length. The puzzle mode has the player rescuing Cleopatra's friends who have been trapped in a pyramid by the evil Sphinx.[CR]Following the initial arcade release in 1997, a PlayStation version and a Sega Saturn version were released in Japan, followed later by the Dreamcast version in 2001. A PlayStation version was released in the USA and Europe in 2003. An arcade only sequel called Cleopatra Fortune Plus was released later in 2001, on the Sega NAOMI system. Both the Dreamcast port and this new sequel were created in association with Altron instead of Natsume.</plot>

        <plot>Confidential Mission is a light-gun compatible shooting game most easily likened to Sega's Virtua Cop series. You play as either Howard Gibson or Jean Clifford, both super-agents a la James Bond, and you are taken through scenarios shooting enemies and attempting to avoid civilian casualties.[CR]The game is a home version of the coin operated arcade machine, and is playable by one or two players. The game includes the popular features of the Virtua Cop series "Justice Shot" (in which you shoot an enemy's gun or gun arm instead of killing them) and the "Combo Shot" in which you can hit an enemy with up to three shots before they expire. The home version does include some mini-games and training modes that were not in the arcade version of the game.</plot>

        <plot>Confidential Mission is a light-gun compatible shooting game most easily likened to Sega's Virtua Cop series. You play as either Howard Gibson or Jean Clifford, both super-agents a la James Bond, and you are taken through scenarios shooting enemies and attempting to avoid civilian casualties.[CR]The game is a home version of the coin operated arcade machine, and is playable by one or two players. The game includes the popular features of the Virtua Cop series "Justice Shot" (in which you shoot an enemy's gun or gun arm instead of killing them) and the "Combo Shot" in which you can hit an enemy with up to three shots before they expire. The home version does include some mini-games and training modes that were not in the arcade version of the game.</plot>

        <plot>Cosmic Smash, originally released in the arcades, is a futuristic sports game, a mix of squash and Breakout.[CR]The player controls a semi-transparent human male in third-person view. The goal is to clear each level from a set of different blocks at the far end of the room within a given time limit. Additional time is given at the start of the next level depending on how well the player did. To clear the room, the player has to hit a ball with a racket at the correct angle. The ball bounces back from the blocks and walls. The blocks have different properties, for example, some have to be hit multiple times before they disappear, while others move around thus making them harder to hit.[CR]Besides the regular shot, the player can also perform a trick shot, which in combination with other moves gives extra points when successfully executed. At the end of each level, a map with branching paths is displayed, enabling the player to take different routes towards the end of the game.</plot>

        <plot>Much like the original, the core gameplay in Crazy Taxi 2 centers around picking people up at destinations which are highlighted with colored rings, and dropping them off at stated destinations.[CR]Crazy Taxi 2 added multiple pickups, which enabled the player to carry multiple passengers, (previously it was restricted to one passenger per journey). The game also saw the introduction of the "Crazy Hop" feature, which allows the player to jump over certain surfaces to save time, as they taxi passengers around the locations. By performing moves such as the "Crazy Hop" and the "Crazy Dash", the driver accumulates tips from their passengers, which increases the total score.[CR]This sequel includes a modified soundtrack with rock bands The Offspring and Methods of Mayhem. The game also has some online modes in the form of a scoreboard, and replay-sharing.</plot>

It is also the first game in the series with network support which allows for upload and download of various game data.[CR]The board is presented isometrically in a bird's eye view perspective with characters and creatures moving on it with the roll of a dice, while using spells and cards during attacks. Each card with a creature holds various info, such as creature's strength and health, weaknesses, items, and card strength, which determine the outcome of a combat. The story mode consists of many level boards you need to conquer as you travel the world map. The board contains different terrain types, structures, and player and AI units which fight for supremacy. Units can also be upgraded which increases the overall strength of that creature.[CR]The game also supports 1-4 player battles over network.

        <plot>D+Vine[Luv] (pronounced Divine Love) is a typical J-RPG, using a top-down perspective with a slightly isometric representation, which also utilizes visual novel segments for adventure elements. The player takes control of Hyde, an adventurous lad who has a knack for exploring dungeons in search of relics from the old world. One day, he arrives at the town called Arvil where he hears a rumor about a nearby unexplored cave. He heads there determined to find new relics, not minding the fact that noone's been there in ages and the place is probably infested with monsters. To his surprise, he doesn't discover and relic or a treasure, but instead, a mysterious girl named Yura. She has apparently lost her memory and can't remember anything but her name.[CR]Unlike the original PC (Windows) version released almost two years earlier, the Dreamcast port does not feature any adult content. A couple of years later, DVD PG Edition release came out which also includes adult content.</plot>

        <plot>It is Christmas of the year 2000. In the skies over Canada, Laura's plane has been hijacked by terrorists. The plane is filled with screams, shouts and fear as the hijackers terrorize the passengers and crew. In one of the seats a black-robed magician gazes into a crystal, chanting the phrase "Shadow, the final destroyer". Laura's compact begins to glow. A vision of a meteorite hurtling towards the Earth is reflected in the mirror. Suddenly the plane is struck by the same meteorite that appeared in the vision, and falls towards the frozen tundra below.[CR]In the middle of a raging blizzard, Laura opens her eyes to find herself inside a mountain cabin. She was saved by Kimberly, one of the passengers of the wrecked plane. Ten days have passed since the crash but Laura can remember nothing, not even her name. The door of the cabin opens and one of the terrorists enters. While Kimberly and Laura stare in horror, he transforms into a hideous monster. He is not the only one. Other crash survivors and locals have mutated into terrifying monstrosities and attacked people. Is there anyway to survive this living nightmare? At present it is shrouded in mystery.[CR]D-2 is a follow-up to D, though the two games are not directly connected to each other story-wise and also have significant differences in gameplay. D-2 combines a horror theme with shooter and role-playing elements. Exploring the vast snowy landscape and investigating the surroundings triggers extensive cutscenes that advance the narrative. The 3D engine allows free navigation around the world, though in-door locations have first-person navigation with limited movement. It is also possible to pilot a snowmobile, hunt for food, and capture photos.[CR]Horrifying monsters will attack randomly (or serve as boss fights at specific points of the plot), at which point the player is taken to a separate combat screen. Laura must dispatch of the enemies by rapidly shooting at them, in a way not dissimilar to the shooting sequences of Snatcher. Enemies can attack from different sides, so the player often has to turn around and quickly react to their attacks. Laura's default gun is weak, but uses unlimited ammunition; stronger guns with limited ammo can be found by exploring the surroundings. Laura receives experience points for defeating enemies and eventually levels up, becoming stronger and having her hit points increased.</plot>

[CR]In Japan, a demonstration version of D2 was packaged with another Warp-produced game, the Dreamcast remake of the Sega Saturn title Real Sound: Kaze no Regret. This early preview of the game, known as D2 Shock Demo, features modified opening credits and a "heads up display" compared to the completed game. Additionally, it contains a save file that copies to the Dreamcast VMU and unlocks a "secret movie" in the retail Japanese version of D2. This movie is a preview of the shelved M2 version of D2. It was removed from the North American version but can briefly be seen as an in-flight movie during the hijacking sequence.</plot>

        <plot>Momohime is a young girl who was found inside a giant peach as a child. She is traveling with her friends, hoping to learn more about where she came from. They have heard of another mysterious young girl named Nayotake who lives in the capital, and are heading there to see if there is any connection, but when they reach the capital they find it under attack by strange creatures! Just what is going on, and is there any connection between Momohime, Nayotake, and the mysterious creatures?[CR]Dancing Blade is an anime FMV game. The player simply watches each scene as it proceeds; the only interaction is occasionally selecting dialogue choices when prompted. Depending on the player's choices, they will reach one of four different endings. Once an ending is reached, the scenario leading to that ending can later be replayed without interruption. Any scene already viewed can also be freely revisited.</plot>

        <plot>A great leader was killed at the end of the 20th century. His name was Fame Douglas, and he was renowned as the sponsor of the legendary Dead or Alive World Combat Championship. Since his death, and in the absence of his charisma and leadership, the world has become chaotic. Yet something appears to be transpiring. Amid this chaos, it is announced that the "Dead or Alive Championship 2" will be held. However, Douglas's passing has taken with it the purpose and significance of the tournament. Even worse, the promoter of "Dead or Alive Championship 2", who is fond of conflicts and jealous of the string, is responsible for Douglas's death. The new promoter is more than a corrupt mastermind, but a man of pure evil. His involvement in the tournament has brought a sense of terror to the world, resulting in the infamous Tengu disaster that occurred at the end of the 20th century. The climax of the disaster is about to begin with a roaring battle.</plot>

        <plot>A great leader was killed at the end of the 20th century. His name was Fame Douglas, and he was renowned as the sponsor of the legendary Dead or Alive World Combat Championship. Since his death, and in the absence of his charisma and leadership, the world has become chaotic. Yet something appears to be transpiring. Amid this chaos, it is announced that the "Dead or Alive Championship 2" will be held. However, Douglas's passing has taken with it the purpose and significance of the tournament. Even worse, the promoter of "Dead or Alive Championship 2", who is fond of conflicts and jealous of the string, is responsible for Douglas's death. The new promoter is more than a corrupt mastermind, but a man of pure evil. His involvement in the tournament has brought a sense of terror to the world, resulting in the infamous Tengu disaster that occurred at the end of the 20th century. The climax of the disaster is about to begin with a roaring battle.</plot>

New game mode "last man standing" where you face all cars in race not for position, but to wreck each other going down a track to see who's last, and "demolition derby" where you fight cars in a arena to see who's last by hitting each other with state-of-the-art graphics where you can see tires, doors, hoods, bumpers, etc. go everywhere.</plot>

        <plot>The player takes the role of a young boy who one day gets sucked into a fantasy world along with his friends after Dejiko's battle went all wrong. Upon arriving to a new world, you find yourself with a forest with Dejiko who seems to have sudden amnesia, and her typical frenzy-self is replaced with somewhat reluctant and shy persona.[CR]Originally released for PC (Windows) in 2001, the Dreamcast port got out later that same year. A couple of years later, the PlayStation 2 version got out under the title Di Gi Charat Fantasy Excellent with additional content.[CR]This visual novel features voice-acting as well as opening and in-game animated cut-scenes, but does not feature any unlockable content typical to most of visual novels. Also, the dialogue text cannot be hidden in order to see unobscured background image. The game does not feature a map of the new world you got sucked into, but lets you select from the list of locations you wish to visit from an overview of the new place you're in. Along with Dejiko, you'll visit new places, talk to new people, and hopefully her amnesia will come to pass and you'll find your way back home together.</plot>

        <plot>102 Dalmatians is a 3D platformer where you become a courageous Dalmatian puppy, who must rescue your family and friends from the clutches of Cruella De Vil. Disney's 102 Dalmatians: Puppies to the Rescue features beloved characters from 101 Dalmatians and new characters based on the upcoming 102 Dalmatians live action movie.[CR]The game follows the films' storyline loosely. The player can choose the role of one of two dalmatians, Oddball or Domino, who are out in the backyard looking for treasure. It is not long before the player realizes that a toy found buried in a park was made at one of Cruella de Vil's toy factories; this alludes to the fact that Cruella's toy sales are down, which ultimately leads to the problem in the storyline. Facing financial ruin from lack of sales, Cruella sets an evil plan in motion - to reprogram her toys to capture any pets in sight. Oddball and Domino are the only puppies in their family who have not been captured when they return from the park. Their parents, Dottie and Dipstick, set out to rescue their puppies, commanding Oddball and Domino to stay home and 'be good.' The puppies do not listen, and are soon out on their biggest adventure yet - to save their brothers and sisters, and their parents who are captured along the way.</plot>

        <plot>You play as Donald in this 3d platform action game. Donald's girlfriend, Daisy is a reporter for a television station in Duckberg. While doing a story on the secret temple of Merlock, a terrible magician, Daisy is kidnapped. Now, it is up to Donald to get her back. Along the way he will have help from his nephews, Huey, Dewey, and Louie, and the inventor Gyro Gearloose. He will also have competition from Gladstone Gander, who is also trying to save Daisy.[CR]Game play alternates between side-scrolling running and jumping and 3d running and jumping. The side scrolling levels play a lot like the Super Mario Bros. games. The 3d levels play a lot like the Crash Bandicoot series of games. All in all, there are 20 levels, spread out through areas.</plot>

        <plot>Idol Star Seeker Remix is the first independent release from developer G.rev Ltd., the game differs quite a bit from the company's later games. It's a fast-paced puzzle game inspired by Minesweeper and is played on a hexagonal grid. The title was undertaken on a short development cycle and budget, but tried to compensate for these flaws through using the appeal of well-endowed anime girls in provocative poses.</plot>

        <plot>Dream On Volume 2 is a Sega Dreamcast demo disc distributed in Europe as part of the Dream On series. It was sold with issue #1 of the UK's Official Dreamcast Magazine, issue #x of Dreamcast: Le Magazine Officiel and issue #1 of Dreamcast: Das Offizielle Magazin. Volume 2 was the first Dream On demo disc to be sold exclusively with magazines.[CR]Dream On Volume 2 contains two playable demos, four movies and a "rolling demo" of Buggy Heat, in which the game isn't playable, but the footage is rendered in real-time. The Millennium Soldier: Expendable demo lets the player play through the first stage, and the Sonic Adventure demo lets players (as Sonic) run through Emerald Coast. The Sonic Adventure demo is particularly common, having been put to work in Generator Vol. 1 and Generator Vol. 2 in North America, kiosks scattered across the world to promote the Dreamcast system, as well as future Dream On demo discs.</plot>

        <plot>Pirates have kidnapped the President's daughter and are holding her on a hijacked cruise ship. Now it's up to an elite police force to get them back, using whatever means necessary. The action takes place on both the cruise ship and the pirate's island hideaway.[CR]You play as one of three cops, in this beat-em up fighting game from Sega. Dynamite Cop features similar gameplay to Die Hard Arcade. As your character enters an area, you have to beat up everyone there. Once they are gone, you continue to the next area. To help you there are many weapons, such as guns, knives, pepper spray, chairs, and bread. Bread? Yes, you can use pretty much anything as a weapon.</plot>

        <plot>At the dawn of the 30th Century, dolphins and humans had been together in a cross-species society for 500 years. Together, they had set out to explore space, offering peace and friendship to all who would welcome it. But space had its dangers; a violent species known as the Foe decided to conquer Earth. However, the dolphins and humans drove them to the brink of defeat, and so the Foe sought vengeance on Earth. The few caretaker dolphins who had been left behind on Earth were not entirely defenseless; they were protected by their creation called the Guardian—a gigantic, sentient being made of a crystalline substance which projected a forcefield over the entire planet. Undeterred, the Foe made suicide attacks on the field, searching for a weak point.</plot>

        <plot>At the dawn of the 30th Century, dolphins and humans had been together in a cross-species society for 500 years. Together, they had set out to explore space, offering peace and friendship to all who would welcome it. But space had its dangers; a violent species known as the Foe decided to conquer Earth. However, the dolphins and humans drove them to the brink of defeat, and so the Foe sought vengeance on Earth. The few caretaker dolphins who had been left behind on Earth were not entirely defenseless; they were protected by their creation called the Guardian—a gigantic, sentient being made of a crystalline substance which projected a forcefield over the entire planet. Undeterred, the Foe made suicide attacks on the field, searching for a weak point.</plot>

        <plot>Elemental Gimmick Gear is an action role-playing game for the Dreamcast console. Elemental Gimmick Gear uses hand-drawn art in an overhead view during exploration, then switches to 3D graphics during boss battles.[CR]In the world of Tokion, a dome-shaped ancient ruin was discovered inside a thick jungle. During excavation, an egg-shaped mecha was found inside the ruins containing a sleeping man. No matter how hard scientists tried, he would not wake up. He was taken to a laboratory along with the machine to be further studied.[CR]Upon analyzing the machine, they learned that it was over 5000 years old. They also could not find any form of power source. In time, the machine became known as "Elemental Gimmick Gear", or EGG for short. After extensive scientific analysis over a number of years, copies of the EGG were produced and used as vehicles.[CR]100 years later, the ruin suddenly became active, extending a multitude of tentacles into the ground. They spread all across the land, destroying anything in their way. With the tentacles came a thick layer of fog that surrounded the ruins, and people gave them the name Fogna.[CR]At the same time, the Sleeper who was discovered a century prior finally awoke. He had not aged a day since his discovery and had no memory of his past or his own name. Selen, who was with him as he woke, set him free without notifying the other scientists in the lab. She sent him to Fogna to begin searching for clues of what happened 5100 years ago, and to stop the tentacles' breeding.</plot>

        <plot>Originally released for PC (Windows) as an adult adventure game, the ports to Dreamcast and PlayStation 2 removed the adult content, included a new heroine and extended the story. You play as Ryouichi Katsuragi, a young doctor and a family physician summoned to tend to an old man living in a huge mansion on the island in Italy. Upon arriving to the island in a helicopter, the game switches to 3rd-person perspective where you can freely explore the mansion and its surroundings and interact with various characters, including the mansion maids which act as heroines in this story. During 1st-person perspective mode, the game plays like a typical visual novel where you converse with other characters which are non-animated but feature voice-acting. The player choices during dialogues affect the story and key choices branch it toward a different ending. The bonus features which are accessible from the main menu are music player and unlockable heroine gallery.</plot>

        <plot>[I]Eve Zero[/I] is a prequel to Eve Burst Error. Once again, the player controls the two main heroes of the series: the witty and womanizing private investigator Kojiroh Amagi, and the beautiful red-haired secret agent Marina. The events of the game take place shortly before those of [I]Eve Burst Error[/I]. Kojiroh is working at Katsuragi Detective Office together with his girlfriend Yayoi. Dr. Nishina, the head of a genetic research facility, hires Kojiroh to investigate the disappearance of his son Shin. At the same time, Marina receives an assignment from her boss Kohno, which involves watching over a representative of an American company. As in all EVE games, the two stories appear unrelated in the beginning and are gradually linked together later in the game.[CR]The player needs to switch between the two protagonists frequently in order to advance in the game. The interface consists of a menu that makes it possible to interact with the game world. Beside the traditional "Look", "Talk", and "Go" commands, there are many others, specific to the situation. Being a Japanese-style adventure game, [I]Eve Zero[/I] does not feature any puzzles.</plot>

        <plot>Ever 17: the out of infinity: Premium Edition is an updated rerelease of Ever 17: the out of infinity released by KID for the Sega Dreamcast in 2003[CR]The game is set in a huge futuristic water amusement park. Built on the ocean, this park is technology's latest word, and is at the first sight the most fascinating and secure construction of all. However, something goes wrong, and seven people - two boys and five girls - become trapped in the park. The danger increases as they face a mysterious virus that brings them on the verge of death.[CR]The player controls two different characters: Takeshi Kuranari, a simple, normal Japanese teenager, and a mysterious boy with amnesia, who cannot even remember his name. The relationship between the characters becomes more and more tense as the story develops. Will the young people be able to solve the mystery and escape death?[CR]Ever17 is the second game in KID's Infinity series. The game is not connected to Never7: The End of Infinity either by storyline or protagonists, but both games share the same "dreamy", semi-futuristic setting, and their stories have a similar style. The gameplay of Ever17 is that of a visual novel: the player reads dialogues and watches scenes, viewing them as one of the two protagonists, occasionally having to make decision as to what to do next and how to answer in a conversation. Those decisions influence the course of the story and lead to different endings.</plot>

Picking up eight years after the last installment of the Evil Dead films, Ash is drawn back to the infamous cabin in the woods only to again face evil forces that have crossed over to our world. Our hero finds himself slicing and dicing carnivorous Kandarian demons, vicious deadites, and other unspeakable atrocities spawned by the notorious Book of the Dead. And in true Evil Dead fashion, Ash must once again attempt to save the world from an appalling and horrific end. Evil Dead: Hail to the King is a survival horror game with over-the-top bloodlust and signature Ash humor--all within the confines of the Evil Dead universe.</plot>

        <plot>Ash, the square-jawed, insult-spewing, shotgun-toting, chainsaw-armed hero from the cult classic Evil Dead trilogy is back. Picking up eight years after the last installment of the Evil Dead films, Ash is drawn back to the infamous cabin in the woods only to again face evil forces that have crossed over to our world. Our hero finds himself slicing and dicing carnivorous Kandarian demons, vicious deadites, and other unspeakable atrocities spawned by the notorious Book of the Dead. And in true Evil Dead fashion, Ash must once again attempt to save the world from an appalling and horrific end. Evil Dead: Hail to the King is a survival horror game with over-the-top bloodlust and signature Ash humor--all within the confines of the Evil Dead universe.</plot>

        <plot>It is the same place. But it is different time. The events of the past will influence the present and change the future. A mysterious item that was hidden thousand years ago will play an important role in the events of today and tomorrow...[CR]1200 BC. Total obedience is what the God demands from the people. Humans have no free will, but they believe that their obedience will bring them reward. The protagonist in this time period is the "flame priest" Ales who serves the God. 200X AD - many good and evil powers are present in the world of our time, but the treasure hunter Kasumi Shindou is only interested in one thing - to find a treasure and become rich, and nothing and nobody will stop him. In the future, 13800 AD, the skies have became black, the oceans are red, and the earth is on the verge of a disaster - Sui, the last descendant of a royal dynasty, and her friends decide to undertake something to change the reality.[CR]Exodus Guilty is a visual novel featuring the so-called "Multitime Zapping System", which allows you to play as Ales, Kasumi, and Sui in their respective time periods, switching between them when necessary. You have to gather various items and to coordinate your actions in the past so that the future will be changed. The gameplay relies largely on dialogues (at certain points you are able to choose one of several available answers). You can also navigate your characters from first-person perspective (pressing arrows that point to different directions). You also have a party - people who join the main protagonists and help them in their quests.[CR]The Dreamcast release, Exodus Guilty Neos, adds full voice acting but is otherwise identical in content.</plot>

        <plot>F355 Challenge is a racing simulation arcade video game based on the actual race car and Ferrari event. It was developed by the AM2 division of Sega for the Sega Naomi Multiboard arcade system board under the direction of Yu Suzuki, and was later ported to the Dreamcast and PlayStation 2 video game consoles under the names F355 Challenge: Passione Rossa and Ferrari F355 Challenge respectively for both American and European releases. The only model of car featured in the game is the Ferrari F355 Challenge model. The game was considered the most accurate simulation of the F355 possible up until that time.[CR]Some versions of the arcade cabinet are noteworthy for having three screens, allowing the player to look through the side windows as they would in a real car. The three-screen cabinet version also features an H-shaped gear stick and three foot pedals, and presents a tough challenge to any player who decides to use them. The cabinet itself is composed of four NAOMI units: one for each of the three screens and one to sync them all. The game also allows the player to use an automatic transmission or paddle-shift the gears. It also uses a real-time "Magic Weather" system similar to Shenmue. The Dreamcast version has link cable play for direct competition, however as of Jan. 2006, the online servers for F355 Challenge are now offline, and the website has gone offline.[CR]The game features an original soundtrack featuring Genki Hitomi and Minoru Niihara that mimics the style of 1980s hard rock/heavy metal which is integrated into a radio station format during gameplay. The radio DJ (and the announcer) goes by the name of Alan J (the Voice, born 14 July 1959).[CR]Yu Suzuki is a keen Ferrari enthusiast who allegedly used data from his own Ferrari 355 at certain tracks to implant in the game during its development.</plot>

It was developed using the KallistiOS Project development tools. The game is compatible with dance pads for the Dreamcast and PlayStation (through a converter), and can also be played using the regular game pad or the Dreamcast keyboard peripheral.</plot>

        <plot>Giant Killers is a text-based football management game, and as such the focus of the game is on the statistics and not on the action.[CR]Based on the 1999 UK season, the game allows the player to take control of any team in the UK's Premier league, Divisions One, Two or Three, or the Conference league. The game has three levels of difficulty. In the easy level the player's club has a wealthy benefactor who makes £25m available, in the medium setting £25m is still available, but two other clubs in the league also receive the same cash injection. In the hard mode there is no extra cash available.[CR]Having started the game and selected a team, the player is presented with the game's main menu. The options here allow the player to access a quick overview of the club's status, fixtures, results and league tables. The main menu also allows the manager to access the transfer market, where players can be bought and sold, and the manager's diary, where messages, such as the success or failure of a transfer bid, are received. It is through the manager's diary that game-time is advanced through to the day of the next match.[CR]On match day the player selects their team from the available squad, and decides the formation to be used and tactics - long ball, direct or passing - for the upcoming match. The game offers many standard formations as well as offering the player the chance to create their own.[CR]Having decided how the game is to be played, the player starts the match. As this is a management game, there is no game play video to watch; instead the player receives match highlights as though on a teleprompter. At any time during the game the player can pause the match and change the team's tactics and / or make a substitution.[CR]At the end of the match the player can view a range of stats on individual performance e.t.c.[CR]The game is entirely mouse controlled, though a keyboard is required when entering names for save games.</plot>

        <plot>As a willing participant in the game, a player chooses a hero from eight different characters including Jiggar the Treasure Hunter, who hunts for gems or Princess Tiara, she of the privileged class whose luck factor in the game awards her with bonus parcels of land.[CR]Upon the throw of the dice, a player moves the allotted spaces on an expansive board broken up into squares. Landing on a property square opens up the option of purchasing it. Essentially, the player is joining the landlord class and may eventually build stores on his/her plots of land which doubles the rent other players have to pay if they land on it. Hoarding adjacent properties eventually helps to build up a mini-fiefdom which exacts payment from hapless opponents to build up the player's treasury.[CR]Battles and events are also triggered when players land on certain squares, or when cards are thrown to ignite a fight. Capcom's monetary denomination is called Zenny, and it is present in games from Forgotten Worlds to Mega Man Legends. It also pays the rent in Gaia Master. At the end of the day, the player with the most Zenny wins.</plot>

        <plot>The diabolical Skorne has scattered the planet's powerful rune stones throughout the world so that nobody can use their powers to challenge his evil rule. Pick your character either the Warrior, Wizard, Valkyrie, or Archer and work with your party as you go on the ultimate manhunt. Fight your way through castles, deserts, temples, and forests and upgrade your weapons and powers as you collect money and experience. The action is fast and furious, but if you don't fight smart you'll find yourself right back where you started. But it'll take more than a powerful punch to get far, as there are a host of puzzles that will challenge your mind and might mean the difference between success and failure. Can you find the rune stones and use them to your advantage? It may be the only way to defeat Skorne, so gather your party and head into the great unknown on the most important journey of your life.</plot>

        <plot>In the World of Giga Wing, many wars have been fought for the divine stone Medallion. Entire civilizations were destroyed in the struggle for gaining control of the legendary item. Now, in the year 2050, four pilots have set off, each carrying a mysterious stone. The stones are said to be the only way to destroy Medallion once and for all. The player can choose to complete the journey for any of the four pilots.[CR]Giga Wing is a vertical scrolling shoot 'em up. Up to two players must steer their planes around enemy bullets and destroy everything in their path with only a limited amount of lives. When tapping the A button, the main gun is fired. Holding the button activates the Reflect Force. The B button fires a bomb from a limited stock to become temporarily invincible. Power-ups can be collected to increase the bomb and life stock or enhance the main gun's fire power.[CR]Scoring works by using the Reflect Force to repel enemy shots. Once the shots hit an enemy, medals appear in their place. When these are collected, the score multiplier increases.</plot>

        <plot>Godzilla Generations: Maximum Impact is a sequel to the Dreamcast launch title Godzilla Generations. Both are based on the famous Japanese movies series around the eponymous Godzilla, a giant dinosaur-like monster.[CR]The game is a rail shooter like the famed Panzer Dragoon, where you move on a fixed path but can shoot in all directions to take down waves of approaching enemies. The game also features a dodge and a lock-on mechanic. The gameplay is divided in two kinds of levels. The first style features Godzilla rampaging through a Japanese city and taking down all kinds of military devices which try to stop him. The second kind of level is a fight between Godzilla and other giant monsters from the various films.</plot>

        <plot>The king has gotten lost looking for his daughter, so a golem sets out on a journey to find him and help him out. [I]The Lost Golem[/I] is a puzzle game where the player must guide the king to a door in each stage by pushing walls around. Each stage is made up of walls, gates, and holes. The king will walk straight forward at all times, and turn whenever he runs into a wall. Walls will move in different ways depending on the gates they are connected to, either rotating around a gate or moving forward one space.[CR]In addition to guiding the king to the goal, the player must also ensure that a certain number of walls are connected to a specific wall, which glows red, by the gates. If the king falls in a hole or gets squished between two walls, or if the wrong number of walls are connected at the end of the stage, the stage is lost and must be tried again.[CR]Cutscenes are interspersed throughout the game, which tell the story in sequences of still images and text. The game also includes a stage editor where you can create your own puzzles.</plot>

        <plot>Lie, cheat, and steal your way through three districts of a huge city in the follow-up to Grand Theft Auto. Earn the respect of 7 different gangs as you demolish the town in your attempt to make lots of cash.[CR]The game takes place at an undisclosed time in the near future. Unlike the first game which featured three different cities, Grand Theft Auto 2 only features a single town, but it's divided in three districts which are unlocked one at a time: downtown, residential and industrial. Like in the original the player goes around answering phones to initiate various missions. The game uses an overhead camera in a 3D landscape and allows the player to freely explore the city and steal any vehicle the player sets his or her eyes on. To unlock new districts the player must reach a certain score which is done by committing crimes and finishing missions.[CR]Because the game now features multiple criminal gangs, the player must choose allegiances. Performing missions for one gang, will decrease the player's reputation for another. When the player commits crimes he also becomes wanted by the local police, but as more crimes are committed without shaking the police, they will give way for first SWAT Teams, then Special Agents and finally the army.[CR]New features include the ability to save at the church, when donating enough money, and various side missions, such as becoming a taxi driver to ear money. There are also many new cars with weapons attached such as a firetruck with a flamethrower and a car with machine guns.</plot>

        <plot>Grauen no Torikago Kapitel 1: Keiyaku (グラウエンの鳥籠 Kapitel 1 「契約」) is not a game, but the first chapter of an horror movie.[CR]This movie is rather unusual:[CR]1) It was sold exclusively through the Dreamcast Direct online service.[CR]2) It's divided into 365 episodes on 6 discs. Each episode lasts one minute.[CR]3) It was impossible to watch all the episodes at once - they opened gradually. From October 1, 1999 to October 2000, it was necessary to connect Dreamcast to the Internet every day and download special save files on the VMU that opened new episodes.[CR]The servers went offline shortly after. Now it is necessary to use a special VMU save or directly extract the videos of the gdi disc image to watch the film.[CR]The sequels of Grauen no Torikago were only available to consumers who had finished previous chapters, making later entries exceedingly rare.[CR]The main character of Grauen no Torikago is a 16-year-old schoolgirl named Nao Tsunoda. Recently, she decided to start living separately from her parents - and moved to Tokyo’s Grauenheim apartment complex. But one day, Nao’s life turns into a nightmare when she suddenly discovers the headless corpse of her neighbor (Erica Shimizu) on the roof of the house.[CR]And having entered a neighbor's apartment, Nao sees an even more eerie scene: music from the opera Faust plays in the room, and Erica’s severed head hangs from the ceiling and makes strange howling sounds! The killer snapped the girl's head and connected it through a hose to the gas pipe so that the head “sang” to the music from the CD player ... But why did the killer do it? Just out of a desire to mock the corpse, or is there a secret meaning in its actions?[CR]Soon the chain of brutal murder continues - and it becomes clear that a psychopath is hunting the inhabitants of Grauenheim. Moreover, it not only kills people, but also disfigures their corpses so that they carry a certain symbolism in themselves. Will our heroine be able to unravel this symbolism and reveal the identity of the killer, or is she destined to become another victim of a maniac?</plot>

        <plot>Gundam Side Story 0079: Rise from the Ashes is a mech combat simulation set in the Gundam universe. Created to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the franchise, it presents an original story set during the One Year War between the Earth Federation and Zeon, parallel to the events of the first Gundam TV series. It takes place in Australia and stars the mobile suit team White Dingo, a guerrilla combat unit supporting the main forces of a Federation counteroffensive against the Zeonic forces.[CR]The player controls Lt. Rayer, who along with his team mates Leung, Mike and Anita must fight Zeon in nine missions. The squad of three mobile suits (Anita controls the OASIS hover truck) must be outfitted by choosing suits, weapons, and shields. Two suits are available from the start: RGM-79 and RGC-80, with the RGC more heavily armed and armored at the cost of reduced mobility.[CR]Missions are seen from a first-person cockpit perspective, but also employ in-engine cutscenes to show plot developments. Mission objectives usually include the destruction of a specific enemy unit or structure, but goals can change mid-mission. Leung and Mike fight on their own but can also be given specific orders, including movement and search patterns, attacking specific enemies or defending friendly units. They can be given preferences for long- mid- or close-range combat. Anita's OASIS truck cannot attack or defend, but can be used to detect enemies on the map through a special radar scan. Enemies include all sorts of ground soldiers, tanks, aircraft and of course mobile suits as seen in the TV show, including Zakus, Goufs and Gelgoogs.</plot>

        <plot>Happy Breeding (DC) also known as Happy Breeding: Cheerful Party (PS2) is a non-adult console port of a Happy Breeding adult visual novel for PC (Windows). While the original game had voice-acting, the console ports changed voice-actresses for some of the heroines. The story revolves around Takashi, who just started living on his own recently. One day, he finds a strange looking girl in his house and ends up living together, seeing how the house was too big for one person and all. It doesn't go too long before he finds himself living together with yet another girl, and yet another. All the girls are not entirely human and display animal traits such as dog's ears, cat's tails, and the likes. Thus his life on his own soon turns out more lively than he expected after leaving his parents. The game is a typical visual novel with basic features of the genre, static characters which only vary in poses, occasional animations such as rain effect, sound effect to indicate what is happening on the scene instead of seeing actual animations, fast-forward option during dialogues, and full voice-acting, but only for main heroines.</plot>

        <plot>Welcome to the future. In the early 21st century, gang warfare and crime have lead to the creation of privatised law enforcement. The Anti-Crime Network (ACN) employs bounty hunters known as ‘Headhunters’ to track down the most wanted criminals, using combat skills and high-tech weaponry. You are Jack Wade, an ex-cop turned Headhunter. At the beginning of the game you find yourself strapped to an operating table and manage to escape. After passing out in an alley, you awake in hospital from a coma. With your license revoked and few memories, you are hired by Angela Stern, to find her fathers murderer. Maybe you’ll even find out what happened to yourself if you can stay alive long enough… Headhunter is an action adventure viewed from over the shoulder. In the top right of the screen you have a radar which will track your movements and those of the enemy. Jack has a few moves at his disposal. He can duck and roll, push, pull and climb objects as well as flatten himself up against a wall. Using this technique he can peek around corners for a better view of the action, and then attack from this position, using the wall as protection. Between levels, Jack has a motorcycle that he uses to transport himself between various locations in the city according to the clues he receives. You will need to earn skill points however before you can arrive at a destination. Certain parts of the city are unavailable until you have gained the appropriate Headhunter license. As you have no recollection of your past, you have to take a series of licenses that will grant you access to greater parts of the city, weaponry and gadgets. These are taken in a VR simulator known as the Law Enforcement Intelligence and Licence Approval (LEILA). At various times in the game you will need to go to the LEILA building and upgrade your licence by practising your combat, stealth and driving skills.</plot>

        <plot>Based on the Heavy Metal world created by Kevin Eastman and Simon Bisley, this fighting title allows you to take control of a team of three fighters, ranging from a basic all-rounder, or a lightning fast female to a huge bulky mass of power. Of course, they are all a mix of human and humanoid, and depending on their strengths, have a range of different moves and styles.[CR]The main aim of the game is to defeat each of the opposing 3-man teams ahead of you, and dominate cyberspace.[CR]The game mixes a little of Street Fighter with a dash of Virtual On, allowing you to fight in close or use long range attacks all inside a 3D landscape.</plot>

        <plot>The game revolves around a promise you made with a girl as a young boy, to meet each other when you grow older, and a secret that has been kept for all these years. While there are many heroines included, this game's premise is more that of a mystery novel than a romance. The story takes place in present time during your reunion with your childhood friends, as well as during past time during your childhood days.[CR]The art style in this game is rather unique in comparison to typical visual novel anime art style. The background art uses somewhat a mix of a life-like re-touched images and anime drawings. While characters use voice-acting in this Dreamcast exclusive visual novel, the animation is non-existent during dialogues. The bonus content features unlockable heroine albums which can be accessed via main menu.</plot>

        <plot>Hundred Swords is a fantasy real-time strategy game with 3D graphics.[CR]Boy prince loves girl princess, but an evil invader spoils the fun by, well, invading. Prince Larf thus battles his way back to his sweetheart. The 3D real-time strategy game was originally created for Sega's Japanese fiber optic service net@, then ported to the Dreamcast but never released outside of Japan. Ported once more to the PC, Hundred Swords finally reached North America and Europe.[CR]Single soldiers? Don’t bother. You control complete units of five to 20 men gathering round a commander. Micro-management is reduced, instead it’s paper, scissors, stone: cavalry is strong against mages, mages are strong against infantry, and so on. Officers can recruit new soldiers in barracks, as long as your mines supply enough of two resources. Your tasks on the small 3D playfields vary from flight to defence to all-out attack, sometimes with time limits. Depending on your success, you are awarded shells, magical items that can be equipped to the commanders and activated in battle for a short-term benefit. Commanders will also gain experience, making them tougher and able to control more soldiers.[CR]In the single-player campaign, anime stills and 3D cut-scenes tell the story of prince Larf and his gang. When the adventure’s through, a mission mode let’s you play single battles with units not available in the main storyline. Up to four players can also link together via network or internet and test their skill against each other.</plot>

A "Making Mode," where you can make a character and buy accessories for her, a gallery mode where you view the art CG, and a sound test to listen to the game's vocal tracks.</plot>

        <plot>Several years ago in the small island nation of Horai, the leader of the nation, Tenro Horai, discovered the Ubusunagami Okinokai—the Power of the Gods. This energy emanated from an object she dug up from deep underground and granted her unimaginable powers. Soon after, Tenro and her followers, who called themselves "The Divine Ones", began conquering nations one after another. "The Chosen People" carried out these conquests in "the name of peace".[CR]Meanwhile, a freedom federation called Tenkaku emerged to challenge Horai. Using fighter planes called Hitekkai, they fought with the hope of freeing the world from the grips of the Horai - but all their efforts were in vain. They were no match for the Horai and were eventually almost completely wiped out. Miraculously, however, one young man survived. His name was Shinra (森羅?).[CR]Shot down near a remote village called Ikaruga, inhabited by elderly people who had been exiled by the Horai's conquests, Shinra was dragged from the wreckage and nursed back to health. Shinra regained his health and pledged to defeat the Horai, and the villagers entrusted him with a fighter plane that they had built themselves, called the Ikaruga.[CR]The Ikaruga was no ordinary plane, designed by former engineering genius Amanai (天内?) with the help of Kazamori (風守?) and the village leaders. Hidden in a secret underground bunker and launched via the transportation device called the "Sword of Acala", it is the first fighter built that integrates both energy polarities, and is capable of successfully switching between the two.</plot>

Earth is building a huge tracking station as first part of the counterattack, but now you detect incoming aliens and they don't look friendly! Defend your base against the initial incursion by manning turret, tank, helicopter, harrier jet, and even captured alien fighter as you battle the aliens in various continents, and eventually lead the counterattack on the moon![CR]Incoming is a 3D shooter with plenty of action. In arcade mode, you can play it as a straight shooter. Some missions have you manning an immobile turret where you simply aim at the sky and engage incoming bogeys. Other missions can have you control a ground hovertank engaging enemy ground threats. Yet other missions will have you control a helicopter, a Harrier jumpjet, and even a captured alien fighter. There are also an "action" mode and "action-tactics" mode, where you are given some limited control of other friendly units.</plot>

        <plot>Blending the stealth, RTS, and RPG genres, Industrial Spy has the player leading a team of superspies (Espion Agents, part of the Blitzstrahl corporation) infiltrating various locales like museums, a military installation, and even a German-style castle full of traps. Each of the agents has his own specialties, like computer hacking, rollerblading, handguns, etc.[CR]Gameplay is like a regular real-time strategy game, with the player acting in the role of commander without taking a direct hand in anything. Give the agents orders and try to keep an eye on all of them as they carry them out. Each agent's skills can be upgraded after missions. Keep them out of sight of guards, spring traps on them, or engage them in hand-to-hand or ranged combat.</plot>

Play with three friends in competition mode or play by yourself and unlock many new modes of play.[CR]Inhabitants will remind you of many other popular games where you need to remove tiles of the same color, only this time there is a twist - You can only remove tiles one away from the tile you are on. The maximum tiles you can remove is therefore five, and that will give you what is known as a four-way combo.</plot>

One day he accidentally touches a mirror in an abandoned building near the school. At this moment, the school becomes infested with monsters. Hikaru and his sister have no choice but to fight the monsters and to find out the connection to the hero's mysterious dreams.[CR]Izumo is a standard Japanese RPG with extensive portions of "digital novel", in which the player views events displayed as anime-style still shots, occasionally making a decision. The main part of the gameplay - RPG - consists of navigating the party of heroes through the dungeon and fighting random enemies in turn-based combat viewed from isometric perspective. The camera can be rotated 180 degrees during exploration. The characters have elemental affinities and can learn various types of elemental magic.</plot>

        <plot>In the 21st century, the Tokyoto city government bans kids from expressing themselves in any way. Only three things keep their spirits alive: Overdriver magnetic-motor skates, graffiti, and a pirate-radio broadcast that's called Jet Grind Radio. Explore and, uh, decorate three fully interactive worlds in which traffic moves at real time and pedestrians wander the streets. Watch out for police who'll want to nab you for breaking the law, and rival crews that want to deface your artwork. The "Cartoon Dimension" art style gives the game the appearance of a 2-D comic, but the characters move through it in complete 3-D. Animations run at 30 frames per second. Ten characters are available at the outset, each of which has its own style and abilities.</plot>

        <plot>Licensed by snooker player Jimmy White, this game is a simulation of not only the British game of snooker, but also of the three main variations of pool.[CR]The game is viewed in detailed 3D, allowing you to rotate the table at all angles, either from overhead or using the cue position as a base. Taking a shot involves setting the exact pace and spin of it, and considering what each contact will do to the position of the cue ball, and any balls you may wish to pot afterwards. In the snooker mode playing accurate 'safety' shots (to prevent your opponent scoring) becomes important as well).[CR]In each mode there are 10 computer opponents, and matches can consist of up to 9 frames. A trick-shot editor is also included, allowing you to practice shots and set up challenges. Replays and an undo mode are also included.</plot>

The cause of all this trouble is the evil Dio, whom JoJo sets out to defeat in order to save his mother. As JoJo travels towards Egypt and a showdown with Dio, he must challenge Dio's minions whose sole purpose is to keep JoJo from succeeding. Playing as one of 16 characters, you'll kick, punch, and pummel your way closer to Dio with each victory. A unique addition to this 2D fighter is the Stand, a guardian spirit that can aid the player during a fight. Unlike mortal beings, Stands can reanimate quickly after being defeated, which is something the player can use to his advantage in battle. Help JoJo save his mom and defeat the diabolical Dio in the saga of JOJO'S BIZARRE ADVENTURE.</plot>

        <plot>July is a mystery adventure game that follows the story of two young men, Makoto Tanimura (19-year old) and Joshua (29-year old) who set on a quest to uncover the mystery behind a bombing that took place several years ago. The story of the two play separately in their own chapters and can be progressed in any order, one chapter at the time. While their stories start separately, their paths cross when they uncover the truth behind the bombing and how it all ties to a secret corporation known as NAX.[CR]July is more of a visual novel where player advances through dialogues and choices, and travels to different locations, than typical adventure with clickable objects and inventory items. The map is a big part of interface and chooses many locations that player can visit as events are triggered by visiting the right place at the right time. The game uses anime style character art with pre-rendered backgrounds and occasional pre-rendered animated cut-scenes. There is no voice-acting, however, neither for player characters nor for NPCs.</plot>

        <plot>The year is 2013. Powerful companies decide to build a new city on a piece of land that remained from the old times, somewhere on the northeast of Japan. This city is constructed with the help of the most modern industry, based on an operation system that is capable to create the most progressive form of urban life - the so-called "intelligent city". But something goes wrong. It seems like a virus that creates a fire substance inside of human beings' bodies. The disease soon became known under the name "Spontaneous Human Combustion". Particularly one district of the newly built Izanami City seems suspicious. Kento Rando, a high school student and an apprentice detective, is given a mission to investigate the mysterious case. Seigai High School is going to be the principal area of investigation. Needless to say that in order to solve the case, Kento will have to find the best strategy talking to the beautiful high school female students...[CR]Kaen Seibo is a Japanese-style adventure which relies largely on conversations and the choices you make during them. However, the game also contains elements of Western-style adventuring. There are items that must be found, picked up and used at appropriate moments. There are areas where you can move through a 3D-like environment, viewing it from first-person perspective. During the dialogues, you also have commands that are accessible through a menu. There are also segments with a time limit.</plot>

        <plot>A kangaroo named Kao was playing with his friends in his native Australia, when suddenly evil hunters appeared, put him in a cage, and took him away. They didn't know that Kao was quite proficient in the art of boxing, so freeing himself from the trap wasn't particularly hard. However, Kao finds himself far away from home, and must fight and hop his way back.[CR]Kao the Kangaroo is a 3D platform action game. The gameplay adheres to the jump-and-run style, Kao having to rapidly traverse levels full of traps and enemies. His basic attack is a simple punch; he can also side-step and swing his tail at the enemies. Power-ups scattered through the stages include coins, a certain amount of which will increase Kao's life points; hearts to replenish his health; boxing gloves, which act as homing projectile attacks; and turbo boosts, which make Kao move faster.</plot>

        <plot>In this unique vertically-scrolling shooter you take the role of a mysterious girl named Karous, who commands a tiny fighter ship and attempts to destroy an evil armada bent on world domination.[CR]The game plays as your average vertical-scrolling shooter, in which you must clear several stages by destroying all incoming enemies and surviving their onslaught. A unique addition to Karous, is that you don't collect weapons by power-ups, but instead upgrade each of your basic weapons (gun, sword and shield) depending on their use thanks to a basic experience module, with increased power and features at later levels (multiple shots, bullet reflection, etc.)[CR]The game uses cel-shaded polygonal graphics with a distinct black and white look.</plot>

        <plot>Kaze no Uta (aka Song of the Wind) is a visual novel erotic adventure game with explicit content. The story takes place in a small rural area around the seaside town called Sakuragi-cho. The protagonist returns from Tokyo to spend the summer in a town which brings him a lot of nostalgic memories. But after being absent for so long, unaware about the current events in the town, the summer vacations may not be so carefree and relaxing as you expect them to be.[CR]The Dreamcast port was release two years after initial Windows release, and is adjusted for consoles as it removes all the adult content. It adds however new CG events to the gameplay and also includes bonus drama disc. There is also a DVD-Player game release which is more similar to the original game and features all the adult content.</plot>

        <plot>Kidou Senshi Gundam: Giren no Yabou is a series of turn-based strategy games developed and published by Bandai, based on the popular Mobile Suit Gundam franchise. It takes its gameplay style from the SD Gundam series and adds political and military management to the One Year War. The title is derived from that of Nobunaga's Ambition, although the English title uses a different translation for the word yabou.[CR]Giren no Yabou: Zeon no Keifu introduces a more complex political system. The player can now create ceasefires and treaties, and the military system supports mobile suit upgrading and customization. The map system is also updated.[CR]Zeon no Keifu expands beyond the One Year War setting and into Zeta-era conflicts, introducing new factions to: AEUG, two factions of the Titans (one under Jamitov and one under Scirocco), Axis Zeon, Neo Zeon, Delaz Fleet. It also includes two versions of the Zeon forces: Kycillia's "Legitimate Zeon" and Garma's "Zeon Reborn".</plot>

        <plot>The game follows the Universal Century (UC) Gundam time line and takes place during the infamous One Year War. [CR]The player is able to pilot various mobile suits and characters from the original Mobile Suit Gundam television series. [CR]There are three gaming modes: [CR]Arcade mode, Versus mode, and Campaign mode. Arcade mode allows to select two mobile suits depending on the side of the conflict chosen (Earth Federation or Principality of Zeon ). The first mobile suit chosen is used for ground combat, while the second one is used in space environments. [CR]Versus mode allows two players to play on the same or opposing sides, with various maps and mobile suits available to choose from. [CR]The Campaign mode is centered around a player named soldier in the One Year War who combats the opposing side. Although in Campaign mode different mobile suits are unlocked as the campaign progresses. New mobile suits can be received by participating in test missions that involve that particular mobile suit. Exceptions are any captured enemy mobile suits, the Project V units (RX-78-2 Gundam, RX-75-4 Guntank, and RX-77-2 Guncannon), as well as all of Char Aznable's mobile suits (MS-06S Zaku II Commander Type, MSM-07S Z'Gok Commander Type, MS-14S Gelgoog Commander Type, and MSN-02 Zeong).</plot>

        <plot>Lack of Love (or L.O.L.) can be considered a genre-defying game, though it has strong elements of adventure (problem-solving based on exploration) and RPG (character growth and management). The game's unusual premise is the evolution of an alien being. In the beginning the player takes control of a tiny, newborn creature. The alien world is harsh, so the "hero" has to constantly improve, learn new things and avoid being eaten by other animals. To make the new life even harder, an alien robot race just discovered the planet and starts colonizing it. Surviving is obviously not easy...[CR]The game is played from a third-person perspective with pre-rendered backgrounds. Since the protagonist is an animal, the game doesn't have any ingame texts; for solving riddles the player is totally dependent on experimentation and careful observation of the environment. To reach the next state of evolution the player will also need to help other beings - as a reward they will give the controlled creature energy balls or new abilities required for further progress.[CR]Besides the usual actions like attacking, biting, and talking (or, better to say, communicating) the creature can perform somewhat strange actions such as sleeping and urinating, which are essential to the gameplay.</plot>

        <plot>Langrisser Millennium is yet another installment of the long-running Japanese strategy RPG series. You control five main characters: Taji, a young boy whom was chosen as the ruler of the country Salem; Nei Lee Sun, the ruler of Chin, who helps Taji when he gets involved in a war; Masariva, a half-beast and a former slave who became a queen, but preferred the life of a wanderer; Rumaty Marf, the queen of the country Misla, on a quest for an angel who appeared in her dream; and Saryune, the ruler of Vidern, whose only desire is power. Those five rulers meet each other, when they get involved in a war with hostile countries. However, soon they learn a greater evil has appeared in the world - they must reach a faraway island to prevent the reincarnation of an evil god...[CR]The gameplay of Langrisser Millennium is divided into "Map Mode" and "Battle Mode". In map mode, you move your characters over a map, trying to reach enemy fortresses and to prevent the enemy to reach yours. Everything happens in real time: if you do nothing, the enemy will come and conquer your country. Once in battle mode, you control several teams. You only assign actions to the team leaders, while others fight automatically in round-based strategy combat.</plot>

        <plot>The Last Blade 2: Heart of the Samurai is a 2D fighting game which features anime-style characters that fight each other with swords, clubs, and even fishing poles. These characters pull off their special moves with that 'quarter-circle-to-half-circle' and 'double-half-circle' controller motions, reminiscent of Street Fighter.</plot>

        <plot>Soul Reaver is a third-person perspective action game with puzzle-solving and some platforming elements. The game follows Raziel on his quest to purge the land of vampires and take revenge on Kain and his brothers, leaders of the six clans. The player views the environments from behind Raziel's shoulder, moving him in any direction, climbing, attacking, jumping and using specific abilities. Raziel's can grip onto the edge of ledges and his torn wings allow him to glide gently downwards. He can also shift through the "material" world into the "spectral" realm at will, but must find specific locations in order to shift back. The two realms mirror one another, with distortions which give access to new areas and platforms. Existing in the material world drains Raziel's life energy at a constant rate.</plot>

        <plot>With exciting first-person sword combat and an engaging storyline with multiple endings, Maken X is one of the most unusual action- adventure games to hit the Dreamcast. Players assume the role of Maken, a supernatural entity that can "brain-jack" the minds and bodies of other characters to utilize their particular strengths and knowledge. Not a bad skill, especially given the evil and gruesome baddies that Maken must overcome. Using a unique lock-on system that targets an opponent's weakest area, Maken takes advantage of a variety of hand-held weapons. As the story unfolds through 20 massive levels, your specific actions will decide your gaming route (as well as which ending you'll uncover).</plot>

        <plot>Maqiupai - Get into Ancient China's crazy mah-jong (in English)[CR]Maqiupai is the classic game of Mahjong with a modern twist. You need to remove all of the tiles in each challenging puzzle before time runs out. You can only remove tiles that match and are free on one side to be removed. You'll have to use lots of strategy to make your way through this variant of Mahjong that has also gone by the name of Shanghai.[CR]What sets Maqiupai apart from the other versions of Shanghai that have been released is how the game is played - there are two modes to Maqiupai: Challenge and Time Attack. In challenge, you will set to the task of removing tiles as quickly as possible. You work as the clock works against you, counting down to your fate. Luckily, you have the use of Shinobi Jokers on your side - tiles that will clear the board of any other tiles like them. After you have unlocked a table in Challenge mode, you will be able to play it in Time Attack and compete with others from around the world by submitting your highest scores online!</plot>

        <plot>Marionette Company 2 is a direct sequel to Marionette Company and you play as a same high-school student from the original. One day, while reminiscing on the events from the past, you stumble upon a pair of abandoned marionettes, Marine and Maria. You take Marine under your care while your classmate Alessa takes the other one. While Alessa dont think of marionettes as anything more than a bunch of circuits pieced together, you experience tells you thats not true and you decide to prove her wrong by once again raising your marionette to a near-human form.[CR]This visual novel comes with a typical interface for such adventure games, and also includes unlockable CG album, but aside from regular story dialogues your main focus in the game would be to construct and upgrade your marionette to act as close as humanly possible. You can teach her communication or you can focus on construction of her physique and functional processing. While you can change her appearance with different outfit or skin and hair color, that will not change her personality or the ability to reason or understand or act differently. For that you will need to acquire and install better CPU, mother board, cooler, generator and other such parts.</plot>

        <plot>Mattel Interactive continues their Dreamcast assault with Max Steel, an action/adventure title based on the hit-rendered TV program of the same name. You control Max, a superhero with the ability to turn invisible and punch through walls, as he valiantly halts the plans of the diabolical John Dread. Gameplay is similar to Fighting Force 2, as you lead Max through expansive levels pummeling your foes with bare fists. The game also features voice-overs by the cast of the television show, adding dramatic flair to the proceedings. </plot>

        <plot>In [I]Milky Season[/I], the player controls a young student who got appointed as the head of the girls' dormitory. This, in turn, will put you into many awkward and romantic situations where you can select how the story will branch and which girl you may fall in love with, based on your choices during dialogues. [I]Milky Season[/I] is a visual novel that originated on consoles (PlayStation and Dreamcast), and is not a PC port and as such had no adult elements to begin with, focusing more on the story and interaction with the characters in this slice-of-life sort of setting.[CR]The game features twelve heroines, letting you check the affection of 8 possible love interests towards you at any point during the game. The game does not feature any animation and characters depict their attitude and disposition only in voice-acting and static poses. Typical visual novel elements are present during gameplay, such as the dialogue text can be toggled to see the clear background, or that your choices may lead you towards a certain path in the story. The twelve heroines you can interact with in the game are: Miki Ayase, Saori Nonohana, Marin Chiura, Chihaya Hoshinami, Yun Usami, Reika Ranzaki, Mio Ayase, Itsuki Fujiwara, Mashiro Tachibana, Urumi Morishita, Kasumi Shindou, and Sachie Tohyama.</plot>

        <plot>In 2463 a race of vicious aliens has invaded human planets, wiping out the population of Novocastria first. Only the Millennium Soldier can lead the human fightback.

Expect non-stop action from fighting and relentlessly killing off tons of bad guys across more than 20 levels of 3rd person 3D action, taking place inside and outside. Powering up your weaponry is crucial - there are 18 different ones to collect, from pulse cannons to particle accelerators and rockets to missiles. Two player cooperative and deathmatch modes are provided.</plot>

        <plot>You wake up at the strange loud sound coming from the bathroom. You get up from the bed and go to check what it was. Duh, it was Sandia and her strange animal companion wreaking havoc. Quick flashback to a couple of days ago, as you were waiting for your father at the airport to return from a negotiation mission from a country devastated by the civil war, to your surprise, he brought someone with him. That someone was Sandia, a princess of the country he just returned from, in danger for her life. It just so happens she'll be staying with your from now on, indefinitely as it seems.[CR]You are Kouki Akiba, a high-school student with a regular boring school life with nothing to cause your sudden elevation in blood pressure. But that's about to change when princess Sandia who recently started living with you enters the same school you are attending. But where there are problems, there are obstacles to overcome, which may over short period of time lead to something more than just friendship between Kouki and Sandia.[CR]The game itself is similar to the majority of visual novels in terms of basic gameplay, but differs in the artwork style which sets it apart from most of them. Bonus features include unlockable BGM player and CG gallery for each of the heroines.</plot>

        <plot>[I]Mizuiro[/I] (みずいろ) was originally released as an adult visual-novel, which yielded this console port for PlayStation 2 and Dreamcast two years later. The game follows the story of Kenji Katase (片瀬 健二), a high-school student who lives with his adopted sister, Yuki (雪希). One day, Kenji's childhood friend, Hiyori Hayasaka (早坂 日和), re-appears in his life and his long-gone feelings of affection toward her started to awaken.[CR]As is the case with many romance-driven visual novels, your choices will determine how the story branches, and your actions will drive the story toward the heroine of your interest. While this console game version removed the adult content, it added additional character and story content with new CG events. As you play through the games, you unlock CG gallery for heroines which is accessible via main menu, along with the music player.</plot>

        <plot>Monaco Grand Prix: Racing Simulation 2, also known as just Monaco Grand Prix, is a Formula one racing game for Microsoft Windows, Nintendo 64, PlayStation, and Dreamcast. It was released in 1999. The game is based on the Formula One World Championship, but does not have the licence to use drivers names, official cars, etc. (the licence was held by Video System at the time, who made F-1 World Grand Prix and F-1 World Grand Prix II). The game does however have a licence to use Formula One's official sponsors; Schweppes and Castrol among others,[citation needed] helping add to the authenticity of the game.[CR]The sequel to F1 Racing Simulation recreates the 1998 season, featuring 17 authentic tracks, 11 teams and cars with their 22 drivers. The Monaco license is used, although the teams themselves are not licensed. A total of 22 camera views are provided. Telemetry is stored and analysed in a similar way to Grand Prix 2, and physics are modeled to be realistic. There are eight different modes to race, the new ones being a career mode in which the player starts with a poor team and must drive well enough to earn competitive rides, and scenarios recreating key races for particular drivers. Returning from the first game are Time Attack, a full championship, and a 50s retro mode. There is also a track editor for the players to create their own tracks.</plot>

        <plot>Mr. Driller's world has been covered with mysterious blocks. Armed with only a mighty drill, you'll have to dig your way down to safety before his air supply runs out![CR]Mr. Driller is a real-time puzzle game that relies solely on quick-thinking and a bit of planning. The gameplay is a combination of Tetris and Boulder Dash: You have to drill down through multi-colored blocks to reach the bottom while avoiding the consequences of reckless drilling; blocks left without a foundation will drop down after a while, potentially crushing Mr. Driller. As the hero's air supply is depleted with time, the player must regularly grab oxygen pick-ups. Some of the blocks are "X-Blocks", which take a few tries to drill through and take away a large chunk of the player's air if destroyed. If four or more X-Blocks come in contact with each other, they vanish and leave behind a small blue creature "Chisokojin", which grants 765 points when picked up.[CR]There are two scenarios in the game, the "2500ft" and "5000ft challenge" (called "500m" and "1000m" in the Japanese version), which are five and ten levels long respectively.</plot>

        <rom name="chd_dc/CHD-Dreamcast/My Merry May (Japan).chd" size="826564452"/>
        <plot>My Merry May is the first game in a planned (but unfinished) trilogy, originally released for Dreamcast in 2002, followed by a PlayStation 2 port later that year. The story revolves around Kyousuke Watarase, a high-school student, who one day received a strange package. In that package was Reu, an AI android in a form of a young girl who ends up living with him under pretense of being his sister.[CR]The game plays as a typical visual novel romance which includes reading on-screen text over background art and character sprites who come in different poses and gestures, but are not animated. Key moments feature special CG artwork to emphasize certain scene and break out from a typical "character sprite over background art" presentation. Aside from main characters, all the heroines feature full voice-acting. Player's choices allow the story to branch toward one of the several different endings, some endings focusing on your relationship with a specific heroine.</plot>

        <plot>[I]My Merry Maybe[/I] visual novel romance adventure game is a sequel to My Merry May visual novel in a similar style with other visual novels developed by KID. The game opens with the protagonist of the story, Hiroto Kishimori, a college student visiting a rural area for a teaching practice, driving together with a high-school principal at night in a rural area. While talking, they notice a white female silhouette on the road, barely managing to hit the breaks in time. Not sure whether what they saw was a real thing or a ghost, they exit the car only to find a young girl on the ground. They put her in the car and rush to the nearby town to find a doctor and help her regain her consciousness. After waking up at the school infirmary, in shock at first, she identifies herself as Rev, a humanoid artificial life form also known as Reprise. She has no memory of who her master is, an naturally, Hiroto ends up being her guardian until her owner is found.[CR]The gameplay and user interface is similar with many other visual novels providing basic functions such as auto-play and pause, hide on-screen text to see background image and characters, message log which can be voice re-played, and many other game options which are almost identical to those in KID's [I]Memories Off[/I] series. Aside from the player character, all other characters, male and female, feature full voice-acting. Characters change poses to depict different attitudes, but also include mouth animations during most of the dialogues.[CR]As a direct sequel to My Merry May, [I]My Merry Maybe[/I] continues the story which was originally planned as a trilogy. While both of the games are limited to Dreamcast and PlayStation 2 platforms, later PlayStation 2 release under the name My Merry May with Be includes both [I]May[/I] and [I]Maybe[/I] stories as well as additional scenarios.</plot>

        <plot>NBA 2K2 is the third game in SEGA's NBA 2K series of basketball simulations. This is the first game in the series to be released for multiple platforms (instead of solely for the Dreamcast). In addition to updated graphics, rosters, arenas, team uniforms, and signature moves for the 2001-2002 season, the 2K2 edition now supports zone defenses (a new NBA rule where you have to choose to play man or zone defense), intercepting of passes, and making adjustments and actions in mid-animation.[CR]There are detailed statistics for each team and player, for a year, the current season or an entire career. The game modes include Exhibition, Season (play a full season along with management), Franchise (more than one season), some arcade street modes and the option to create custom tournaments.</plot>

        <plot>Rather than 5 on 5 action like professional play, this game features 3 on 3 play. Using players from the NBA, each player chooses a guard, forward, and center from the team's NBA roster for the first half and can make substitutions for the second half.[CR]NBA Hoopz is an arcade-style game and not meant to be realistic: players can jump twenty or thirty feet in the air, dunk the ball from 20 feet (6.1 m) away, and do otherwise physically impossible things. Fouls are only called on flagrant pushes, foul shots are rare (and only after a number of fouls are accumulated), and there is no out of bounds. In addition, after a player makes three consecutive shots he becomes "on fire" which allows him to make almost any shot as well as goaltend without penalty.</plot>

        <plot>NFL Blitz is a series of American football themed video games by Midway featuring National Football League teams. It began as a 1997 arcade game that was ported to home consoles and spawned several sequels. Rather than being designed as a realistic interpretation of the sport of football, like Madden NFL or NFL 2K, the Blitz series was created as an over-the-top, exaggerated version of the sport, inspired by Midway's own NBA Jam basketball games.[CR]In 2005, following the loss of the NFL license, the Blitz series was relaunched as Blitz: The League, featuring fictional players and teams in a fictional league with slightly more realistic (though still exaggerated) on-field play and a focus on the seedy behind-the-scenes lives of the players.[CR]The series rebooted January 4, 2012 on PlayStation Network and Xbox Live. The game took the series back to the original style of NFL BLITZ, but removed the late hits due to input by the NFL.</plot>

        <plot>No refs... No rules... Just 'classic' gridiron. Late hits, pass interferences, and other penalties are encouraged (though you can't run offside). Cheerleaders in, well, cheerleading uniforms liven up the end of the first and third quarter and there's enough stats to make the mathematically inclined happy. However, the teams features are not entirely based on real life (Indy was at the top), and it is not as addictive as the old-fashioned PC games of the early 1990's, but still a good game for someone who doesn't mind not-so-classic, almost XFL style football.</plot>

        <plot>The player controls Arsia, a young girl, wandering around Napple town and levels themed around the four seasons. To restore peace, Arsia and her pet creatures will have to collect six "petals". [CR]Although the game is primarily a platform game, there are many people to talk to and a complete story accompanying the action. Exploration parts mainly develop in Napple with a third person view, while the platformer levels, the four seasons, gets a 2D side-scrolling camera. In side-scrolling levels, Arsia usually has to complete the level and fight against a boss. Several levels requires certain items or people to talk to, meaning that the player might need to revisit some levels several times to go on with the quest.[CR]The game setting is influenced by European fairy tale tradition, with classical cartoon-looking characters (somewhat reminding of Alice in Wonderland) and colored houses. For example, Pierrot the clown, talking trees, and a cow barman appear in the game.[CR]Napple Tale also offers micro-management with pets, items, and a complex process to create new creatures or items by combining several of them in various ways (similar to the store in Power Stone 2 or all games of the Atelier series). The player can also be carried out collecting all cards and be sure that he or she has seen everything in the game.</plot>

        <plot>Golden Logres is another pinball simulator by LittleWing. A sequel to both Tristan and Crystal Caliburn, the game features three tables based on the Arthurian legends: Camelot, Land's End and Fisher King. After completing all the missions on one table, the game moves to the next one. A practice mode is available to test the last two tables and prepare to the full game.[CR]In Camelot, the first table, the objective is to complete all quests, each assigned to a different knight of the round table. The screen shows two medieval banners with the table sitting at the middle. The banners list the active quests, the score, the number of balls left and the status of the game. To start one of the adventures, the player must shoot ramps, sink the ball in holes or drop targets a number of times and then hit the Taliessin holder near the Merlin ramp. Taliessin was a court jester, musician and poet, and he assigns the quests to the knights. When an event occurs, like the end of a quest, a small window appears over the table with a picture and text explaining the situation. After all the quests are complete, the game moves to the next table after hitting the drop targets for the sloth, envy and lust sins, and sinking the ball in the quest hole.[CR]In the second table called Land's End, Lancelot, Tristan and Gawain, the three knights considered the bravest of them all, must prove their courage by undertaking the most dangerous quests. A multiball starts after completing each adventure. Tristan has to kill the dragon, by shooting its ramp and turning on all the lights that spell its name, then sink the ball in the medicine and "myst" hole. Lancelot must lift the curse that fell upon Dolorous Gard, his castle, by shooting the castle ramp and turning on "CASTLE", and receive a gift from the Lady of the Lake after dropping the ball in the magic shield hole. Gawain has to defeat the Green Knight by hitting the "ERRANTRY" ramp to turn on the letter lights, and collect a proof of bravery from Lady Bercilak by getting the ball inside the sash hole. When all the quests are complete, the game switches back to Camelot automatically.[CR]In the final Fisher King table, the ultimate goal is to collect the holy grail from the castle. The three guardians of the grail (Perceval, Bors, and Galahad) must acquire the holy relic and bring it back to Camelot. They receive the aid of other three fellow knights: Balin, Gareth and Palomides. Balin must get the Longinus spear that pierced Jesus on the cross, by turning on its name hitting the "LONGINUS" spot targets, and enter the castle at the top of the table. Gareth has to defeat the three evil knights, by sinking the ball in the challenge hole and dropping the red, blue and black targets, and finally send the ball to the castle to start a multiball. Palomides must kill Arthur's sin, that became a monster after his death, by shooting the beast lane turning on the "BEAST" lights, and sinking the ball in the castle. The grail knights retrieve the sacred cup by hitting the holy targets and the Perceval hole, both activated after colliding with bumpers named after each knight, turning on the "HOLY GRAIL" letters at the center. A multiball starts after entering the castle and receiving the grail. After all modes are finished, the game returns to Camelot.</plot>

        <plot>Rhapsody of Zephyr is a Korean-made role-playing game and a side-story in The War of Genesis series. Unlike most other installments of the series, it has less tactical elements and is more close to the traditional Japanese-style RPG format.[CR]The story of the game is loosely based on Alexandre Dumas' famous novel The Count of Monte-Cristo. The game is set in a pseudo-European New Age environment (17th -19th centuries). The hero of the game, a young nobleman Cyrano Bernstein, is betrayed by his fiancee Mercedes and is captured by the evil warlock Cesare Borgia. After fleeing from the prison, Cyrano swears revenge, and sets off to find a legendary sword sealed on a nearby island and to recruit allies in order to get involved in a war between two powerful empires.[CR]The game features turn-based tactical combat, which allows the player to move the characters on the battlefield. The player can use a variety of magic spells, recruit townspeople to help the protagonists in battles, and have special statistics for weapons, which have their own HP and can be damaged and destroyed in battles.</plot>

        <plot>Ooga Booga is an online multiplayer game for the Dreamcast, focusing on the combat of "Kahunas" using thrown shrunken heads, riding animals, staffs, or using spells. The storyline is that Ooga Booga is a volcano goddess that creates islands, and has leaders of tribes, the Kahunas, that battle for her favor. It has a distinct Polynesian style and tone, and has many multiplayer islands and characters which can be unlocked. It was one of the last online games for the Dreamcast. There are four basic Kahunas that the player can use - Hottie (balanced), Fatty (strong), Twitchy (fast), and Hoodoo (spells). There are other unlockable Kahunas based on the main four. Some of them include Death (a floating skeleton), Abe (Former U.S. President Abraham Lincoln), Superguy (superhero), and Dwarf (a dwarf). There are multiple masks for each base Kahuna, unlocked by winning enough matches. There are many different arenas as well, varying from a pyramid to a jungle island to a small and empty desert. It received very positive reviews, including a 9.6 from IGN.</plot>

        <plot>You might be good enough to join Interforce, a private enterprise formed to fight terrorism, but to lead the team, you'll have to prove you're better than the other members. Outtrigger is a combat game that features both first- and third-person perspectives, and while it comes with a batch of single-player scenario missions, the game favors multiplayer mayhem. A split-screen mode for up to four players allows friends to compete in-house, and online cooperative play lets you form teams over the Internet. Settings include castle ruins, an observatory, abandoned train stations, and more. The game's cache of weapons includes flamethrowers, photon torpedoes, and rocket launchers, to name a few.</plot>

        <plot>Pier Solar and the Great Architects is an independently developed Sega Mega Drive game, released worldwide in December 2010 by WaterMelon, a group of developers from the Mega Drive homebrew and research scene. It is a turn-based RPG, and, at 8 megabytes (64 megabits) in size means it is currently the second largest Sega Mega Drive game available. It is the first internationally commercially released Mega Drive game since 2002's Mega Games 10 (not counting Super Fighter Team's releases, which have all been translations of games released in the 1990s). The game ships for $35 USD and has a clamshell case with a choice of three cover arts which resemble those used by Sega in Japan, North America and Europe towards the end of the Mega Drive's lifespan. Also included is a 24-page full colour instruction manual and a "MEGA Soundtrack Booster CD", containing the game's soundtrack, which, if the player has a Sega Mega-CD attached, can be used as an alternate source of the game's music during gameplay (however it is not a standalone Mega CD game). 500 "Posterity Packs" were also sold, with buyers receiving their names in the game's credits and instruction booklet.</plot>

        <plot>Plus Plum is an action puzzle game released in Japan in 1999 and published by Takuyo. Gameplay is similar to Tetris where red, blue, yellow, green, white, or purple spheres drop from the top of the screen one at a time and must be matched with similar colors in an adjacent row. The player places the spheres and that toggle in color as they fall from red to blue, yellow to green, or white to purple. If three or more spheres of similar color are dropped adjacent to one another, the line of spheres will disappear, and any spheres above will fall to next level. All spheres touching the line that disappears will switch to their alternate colors. The twist on the typical Tetris-gameplay is that the spheres fall onto a platform that can only hold so much weight before it gradually gives way under the strain of too many spheres and gets pushed to the bottom of the screen.</plot>

        <plot>This simulation game was originally released for PlayStation as three separate games, each focusing on a single heroine. The Dreamcast version includes all three heroines: Yumi Aida, Shizuka Houjouin, and Fumio Ueno. While the PSX version supports PocketStation, the Dreamcast version uses visual memory which also uses graphical representation of the character you are interacting with, and emphasizes what is currently happening on the main screen. You can meet the girls, buy them gifts, talk to them, check the progress status, and play various mini-games. The game also includes printed stickers of all three heroines with some additional artwork as well.</plot>

        <plot>pop'n music is the first title in Konami's long-running rhythm game series, and the second Bemani series after the original beatmania. Very similar to its sister game beatmania, pop'n music ditches the turntable and keyboard in favor of nine large candy-colored buttons, but otherwise plays much the same. Notes scroll toward the bottom of the screen, and the player must tap the correct buttons in time with the music to play along. Play well, and the "groove meter" increases, but play poorly and it will drop. If the groove meter is high enough at the end of the song, the player can move on to the next song.[CR]This first release includes all of the music from the original arcade release, along with several new original tracks. There is also the standard arcade mode, along with a training mode and a beginner's mode that only uses 5 or 7 of the 9 buttons.</plot>

Several new high-difficulty modes for advanced players have been added, and there is also support for a miniaturized 5-button version of the game called Dokodemo pop'n music that can be played on the PocketStation or Dreamcast VMU. It also functions as a Key Disc for latter Append Disc releases in the series, much like Konami's other Bemani franchises.</plot>

        <plot>Though there have been countless games based on Jet Ski racing since Wave Race 64 originally kick-started the genre several years ago, no game has lived up to the original. CSK Research Institute, the developer of the Aero Dancing series, hopes to change that with Power Jet Racing 2001, a water-based racing game for the Dreamcast.[CR]You'll be able to select one of six racers, each with his or her favorite Jet Ski. Ryan, Kate, Max, Yuki, Spike, and Matt all have different attributes and qualities that define their riding styles. The game features several modes. The championship mode plays similar to the arcade-game format, where you have to finish each race with a high rank to get to the next one. The technical challenge mode tests your skills and abilities by requiring you to execute several different moves such as loops, barrel rolls, bunny hops, and submarines. Other modes include the balloon race, time attack, and two-player versus modes.</plot>

        <plot>The Sultan of Persia and his son-in-law are visiting the Sultan's brother, Assan. The friendly family meeting soon turns into a nightmare: Assan kills the young Prince's bodyguards, locks him up in a prison, and captures the Sultan. The reason is a little disagreement between the brothers regarding matrimonial arrangements: it appears that the Sultan had promised his daughter to Assan's son, Rugnor, and later broke his promise by letting her marry the Prince. In the resulting turmoil, the Sultan is killed, and the Princess is kidnapped by Rugnor, a ruthless half-tiger creature. The Prince must figure out a way to find Rugnor, defeat him, and rescue his wife.[CR]Prince of Persia 3D is just what its title implies: an action platformer with puzzle-solving elements in the style of the previous Prince of Persia games, but set in a three-dimensional environment. The Prince still has to time his jumps, avoid deadly traps, interact with the environment, and fight Rugnor's minions who will try to stop him.</plot>

While the goal is to get close to various girls and get together with the girl you like, unless you find a way to break the time loop, after the day resets you will have to do the wooing all over again, which may be play if you decide to go for a different girl. The game is a typical visual novel game which uses static 2D anime style characters over background which is comprised in small portion of an artwork showing the location while majority is the window frame itself with dialogue window pasted over the character you are talking to.</plot>

        <plot>Psychic Force 2012, the sequel to Psychic Force, is a one-on-one fighting game with a twist. The matches take place inside a giant floating cube. You are able to fly, using your psychic abilities, around a 3D arena with six walls. Each of the ten available characters, Might, Regina, Wendy, Emilio, Setsuna, Patty, Gudeath, Genshin, Carlo, and Gates, are controlled with three buttons: guard, weak attack and strong attack. The effect varies with the distance. Next to the regular life meter, there is also a power meter. By using special moves, the meter is drained and your moves are limited. It is possible to recharge, and the capacity of the power meter expands when you lose a lot of health.[CR]Additionally, each fighter has its own unique moves, energy attacks and a weapon, which they use, mid-flight, to pummel their opponent. There are three main game modes: training, versus and a story mode using static anime-inspired images and in-engine cut scenes to tell the story. The story centers around two groups of psychics with differing ideals about co-existence with humans. In the middle of this are several neutral psychics with ties to members in either group.</plot>

        <plot>Puyo Puyo Fever (ぷよぷよフィーバー), renamed Puyo Pop Fever for international release, is the fifth "main" installment in the Puyo Puyo series, originally developed for Sega NAOMI arcade hardware by Sonic Team. It was the first completely original Puyo Puyo title to be produced after the original developers, Compile, filed for bankruptcy.[CR]Puyo Puyo Fever is as close as the series has come to a reboot, abandoning most of Compile's Madou Monogatari characters and settings in favour of a new, original cast engineered by Sonic Team. However saying this, the game's story still remains canon with prior games, as Arle and Carbuncle are transported to this new world after the former's magic fails.</plot>

It was first released for the Sega Dreamcast (rather than an arcade platform) in 1999. Like previous games in the series, the title of the game is a play on words - "yon", the Japanese word for four, appears if you pronounce the game's name as "Puyo Puyon" (furthermore, puyo in various Madou Monogatari games also say this). As with most games in the series, Puyo Puyo~n did not leave Japan.</plot>

        <plot>Radirgy is a vertical-screen top-down bullet-hell shooter originally developed by Milestone for Naomi arcade system and later released on console systems. The game features bright, cartoony, cel-shaded graphics. At the beginning, the player is given choice among three different mecha-ships: one with a spread-gun, a weak homing laser, or a slow but powerful bubble gun. Additionally, each ship can use a sword for anything that gets too close, or specific enemies which can't be killed otherwise, a shield, which appears at the front of the ship once the player lets go of the fire button, and a smart-bomb-like field that can be extended around the player in a small circle, damaging enemies, absorbing their shots and turning them into points.</plot>

        <plot>Another shooter in the Cotton saga. Trouble brews in the homeland of Cotton's long time friend Silk, as the evil demon Suede steals the legendary Willow candy from the queen's castle. Seeing as how no one can face Suede and his forces Silk drafts Cotton in order to restore peace to her land, but she may have forgotten that Cotton is a big fan of Willow candies herself...[CR]Gameplay-wise Rainbow Cotton actually follows in the steps of Panorama Cotton as the gameplay switches from a 2D perspective to a 3rd person one. The gameplay itself however is reminiscent of games like Panzer Dragoon, in which you don't control Cotton as she flies, but instead where she aims with her magic spells. You can shoot down enemies as well as open chests, doors and other bonus locations for power-ups and spells, which advance Cotton's abilities in an rpg-lite fashion and increase your arsenal with different magical powers.[CR]Taking advantage of the technological advances, the game uses for the first time polygonal graphics and to complement the action the game features 2D animated cutscenes between levels.</plot>

        <plot>Ready 2 Rumble Boxing: Round 2 is a boxing game for the Dreamcast, Nintendo 64, PlayStation, PlayStation 2, and Game Boy Advance. It is also the sequel to Ready 2 Rumble Boxing.[CR]Gameplay in the game is similar to that of the previous game. The more big hits the player land consecutively, letters that spell out "RUMBLE" appear below the player's side of the screen. Letters also appear when the fighter taunts his opponent. Once the word is formed, powerful combo attacks can be activated that will almost definitely knock the opponent down. This time, however, there are three levels of "RUMBLE", which build up one after the other. If the player successfully lands a combo with his RUMBLE Meter full on the third level (where the letters start smoking), the final blow can launch the opponent clear out of the ring, giving the player an instant victory.</plot>

        <plot>Ready 2 Rumble Boxing: Round 2 is a boxing game for the Dreamcast, Nintendo 64, PlayStation, PlayStation 2, and Game Boy Advance. It is also the sequel to Ready 2 Rumble Boxing.[CR]Gameplay in the game is similar to that of the previous game. The more big hits the player land consecutively, letters that spell out "RUMBLE" appear below the player's side of the screen. Letters also appear when the fighter taunts his opponent. Once the word is formed, powerful combo attacks can be activated that will almost definitely knock the opponent down. This time, however, there are three levels of "RUMBLE", which build up one after the other. If the player successfully lands a combo with his RUMBLE Meter full on the third level (where the letters start smoking), the final blow can launch the opponent clear out of the ring, giving the player an instant victory.</plot>

        <plot>The game begins with Claire Redfield raiding an Umbrella Corporation facility in Paris in search of her brother, Chris Redfield. During the infiltration she is captured and imprisoned on Rockfort Island. Soon after arriving, a man named Rodrigo Juan Raval releases her from her cell, since she is not much of a threat considering the outbreak of the T-virus on Rockfort. Trying to escape from the contaminated island, Claire teams up with inmate Steve Burnside, at the same time being confronted with the island's commander Alfred Ashford. Meanwhile, Albert Wesker is on a mission of his own to retrieve a sample of the T-Veronica virus developed by Alfred's twin sister Alexia. His unit is also responsible for the outbreak of the T-virus on Rockfort Island.</plot>

        <plot>The game begins with Claire Redfield raiding an Umbrella Corporation facility in Paris in search of her brother, Chris Redfield. During the infiltration she is captured and imprisoned on Rockfort Island. Soon after arriving, a man named Rodrigo Juan Raval releases her from her cell, since she is not much of a threat considering the outbreak of the T-virus on Rockfort. Trying to escape from the contaminated island, Claire teams up with inmate Steve Burnside, at the same time being confronted with the island's commander Alfred Ashford. Meanwhile, Albert Wesker is on a mission of his own to retrieve a sample of the T-Veronica virus developed by Alfred's twin sister Alexia. His unit is also responsible for the outbreak of the T-virus on Rockfort Island.</plot>

        <plot>The game is set two months after the events of the first Resident Evil, in the Midwestern American mountain community of Raccoon City. Nearly all of its citizens have been transformed into zombies by an outbreak of the T-virus, a new type of biological weapon secretly developed by the pharmaceutical company Umbrella. The game's two protagonists are Leon S. Kennedy, a rookie police officer on his first day in the local force, and Claire Redfield, a college student looking for her brother Chris. Having just arrived in the city, Leon and Claire make their way to the Raccoon Police Department, seeking protection from the mutated population. There, they discover that most of the policemen have been killed already, and that Chris has left town to investigate the Umbrella headquarters in Europe. With no remaining motivation to stay, the two protagonists split up to look for other survivors and flee the city. While searching for an escape route, Claire meets a little girl named Sherry, who is on the run from an unknown creature, and Leon encounters Ada Wong, who claims to be looking for her boyfriend John, an Umbrella researcher.</plot>

        <plot>Patterned after genre-defining games such as Resident Evil and Silent Hill, The Ring: Terror's Realm presents a survival-horror experience with all the standard features one would expect. Players assume the role of Meg Rainman, the girlfriend of fellow CDC employee Robert, who, along with three other colleagues, met a mysterious and untimely death while playing a new video game. Determined to uncover the truth, Meg discovers the program on Robert's computer and is promptly sucked into a virtual world. Here, she becomes infected with a virus and has only the next seven days to live.[CR]The Ring: Terror's Realm presents players with a handful of different perspectives including third-person, first-person, and a dynamic viewpoint similar purpose to that in the Resident Evil series, which provides constantly changing camera angles. The core gameplay has players traveling between the real and virtual worlds while acquiring items, solving puzzles, and killing larvae, lizards, gorillas, and other monsters. Initially armed with little more than a basic handgun, Meg will eventually amass weapons such as a shotgun, an assault rifle, a rocket launcher, and more.[CR]When in the virtual world, players can make use of a flashlight to help Meg find her way through the darkened corridors. Other useful items she include healing serum and various context-sensitive objects that will aid her progress through the adventure. Often, Meg will be required to seek out a specific character in order to advance. Cut scenes highlight important encounters throughout the quest. Players can record their progress using devices scattered around the game world and can manage their inventory by placing unwanted items in boxes, which also are found in various locations.</plot>

More money can be earned by winning the races and that in turn allows to buy new cars or upgrade the ones that are already in possession.[CR] Multi-Player – Multi-player mode supports up to 2 human players that can compete in any of the available circuits with 4 more CPU controlled racers. The mode allows for either vertical or horizontal split screen.[CR] Quick Race – In Quick Race the player can select the racer, car, circuit and weather conditions, and race against 7 more CPU controlled players.[CR] Time Trial – Like Quick Race mode, the player can also select here the racer, car, circuit and weather conditions but without the competition of the other modes, the player races against time for as many laps as the player wants.</plot>

        <plot>Chain-smoking Neji Taihei is an average Japanese guy, lives by himself in his apartment, and is kind of a loser. Naturally, just letting the guy continue being a loser isn't particularly interesting, so a spirit that happens to also live in his apartment starts to toy with his daily life.[CR]You can affect Neji in two different ways. If he's not around, you can interact with things in his apartment like moving his table, or locking his door. If he is around, you can throw little ping-pong balls at objects to focus his attention on them. If you throw too many too fast, though, he'll get depressed and ignore you.[CR]The game follows a calendar with different missions to do on different days. Each mission in the game starts with a short video showing what you need to get Neji to do, which can be something simple like making him use his computer or drink a glass of water, or something more complicated like getting him to order something from a TV ad. Depending on your success in each mission, the outcome will change, and you will determine if Neji remains a loser for the rest of his life.</plot>

        <plot>Asami Onohara is in most ways an average high-school girl; cheerful, outgoing, and just a bit clumsy. She has a secret, though: she's married to her physics teacher! Apart from her parents, nobody but the two of them know, and if they want to stay together, it needs to stay that way until she graduates.[CR][I]Roommate Asami[/I] is a spinoff of Datam Polystar's Roommate series based on the manga [I]Okusama wa Joshikōsei[/I] (My Wife is a High School Student) by Hiyoko Kobayashi. The game proceeds in standard visual novel fashion from point of view of the teacher, who must be named by the player. Each day is broken up into four segments, and at certain times it is possible to visit different locations around the city, which will cause different events to occur. During conversations, there are often points where the player must choose from multiple responses, which will affect the flow of the story and potentially lead toward different endings.[CR]The Dreamcast "Director's Edition" features higher-resolution CG images and includes a bonus disc with drama tracks and voice data, but is otherwise identical.</plot>

Unlike in previous games, this game emphasizes word "novel" in its title by having the game play resemble that of a visual novel without built-in clock and time progress as in previous titles. Heroine in this story is Yuka Satou (佐藤 由香) which one day suddenly appears on your doorstep. You returned to your hometown from Tokyo for the summer, and you end up sharing a place with Yuka during the holidays. The text screen with player choices appears over the entire image instead of a dialogue window, and choices made by the player will lead to one of multiple endings.</plot>

        <plot>It is the Taishou Era in Japan, and the Western world has begun to make its way through traditional Japan. Technology is evolving, and the use of steam has made for great breakthroughs in transportation in weaponry. But the world faces a deadly threat: a dark cult wishes to destroy Japan and the very world itself. To combat any possible threats, the Imperial government of Japan brings together 6 young ladies from around the world to form the Hanagumi (Flower Bridage) division of the Teikoku Kagekidan (Imperial Floral Assault Group). Clad in their proud spiritual armor, the Kobou, these young women are the frontline of defense against the demon worshippers, but they haven't a leader to guide them into battle.[CR]And, with a single letter, young Navy ensign Ichiro Ogami's life is about to take a very interesting turn as the chosen leader of the Hanagumi! Ichiro now has to gain the trust of the members of the Hanagumi if he expects to keep things under control.[CR]The gameplay of Sakura Taisen is a combination of Japanese-style adventure with dating mechanics and tactical turn-based combat. Most of the game is spent exploring the theater, which serves as a disguise for the military base. Depending on the player's decisions - where to go, which girl to look for, how to answer the questions (there is a time limit for responses) - the protagonist will develop different relationships with the girls, which will influence not only further dialogues and the ending, but also slightly affect their parameters in battles. During combat, the player navigates Ichiro and the girls over an isometric battlefield and attack the enemies physically, or charge for powerful special attacks. Each turn it is possible to perform two different actions per character; walking distance and attack range are limited and unique to each character. There is no experience points system and also no equipment in the game.</plot>

        <plot>Following along from the first game, [I]Hanagumi Taisen Columns 2[/I] features a few refinements to the gameplay formula. The biggest change is the introduction of a battle mode selection system, allowing the player to choose one of four different styles to alter their character's gameplay. Forest is a balanced style which behaves like the rules of the previous game, with the player able to store up to three levels of super meter; Wind limits the player to only two levels of meter, but fills the meter more quickly; Mountain starts the player off with additional meter at the penalty of filling meter more slowly; and Fire allows the player to fill their meter to 4 but limits the maximum level of defensive attack to 2. Two additional modes are unlockable after completing certain story modes: Shadow, which starts with the player's meter completely full but with a major penalty to refilling it; and Lightning, which allows the player to fill their attack meter to 4 and grants a major boost to the speed at which they fill it, but prevents the player from using any defensive options at all.[CR]The visual novel story mode follows a similar plot to the first game, but this time focuses on a production of Shonen Red vs. Benitokage with the characters competing for the role of Shonen Red. An extra unlockable story mode becomes available once the player has unlocked the four secret characters and focuses on them specifically.</plot>

        <plot>In the third installment of the Sakura Taisen series, Ichiro Ogami goes to Paris, to command the pretty girls of Paris Kagekidan (Flower Assault Squad), led by the lovely Erica.

Something is once again wrong in the Imperial Capital, as two street cars go berserk without any reason, saved only by the mech-commanding girls of the Hanagumi Brigade. The girls from Paris Kagekidan return to join forces with the original cast, to help Ichiro defeat evil one more time.[CR]Sakura Taisen 4 utilizes the same gameplay mechanics as its predecessor, including a virtually identical combat scheme. As always, you have to choose and time your responses well to attract the attention of one of the lovely girls you command.

As the music plays, the player must shake the maracas in the appropriate region with proper timing to progress. A standard controller can also be used if you do not have the maracas controller, which is sold separately.[CR]The music in the game comes from a wide variety of sources.

        <plot>This game is the update to the original, maraca shaking, Samba de Amigo. A lot more has been added than in most updates. A new hustle maneuver complements the six original ones giving life to a related mode of play requiring to shake maracas and assume poses in new manner; the song list has been nearly doubled, with many new songs such as Vamos de Carnaval, the theme from Rocky and even the Wedding March being included. All songs can optionally be played shaking and posing in the previous instalment's way, or rather in Hustle Mode: wholly different game experiences follow from one or the other of the two of the choices. For anyone who thought they had the original game mastered, there's a survival mode where you have to play through all 43 songs making a maximum of 8 mistakes in total. The Challenge mode is refreshed with new goals to achieve, as well as five secret stages intending to set the player before a more exacting challenge. The core gameplay effectively remains the same as the original though. This game was only released in Japan.</plot>

        <plot>Sega Marine Fishing is a fishing video game in which the player attempts to catch various marine sport fish. The gameplay's emphasis was on enticing fish to bite onto the lure and then successfully fighting the fish and reeling it to the boat.[CR]As the player catches fish, they earn item cards. Items earned with these cards include fish and artifacts for an aquarium, fishing equipment, additional boats, and various goofy accessories such as different colored shorts. The game also featured two modes of online play: tournament fishing and "fish mail". In tournament fishing, players competed to catch the biggest fish within a species. Fish mail consisted of writing short messages. Players could receive random messages by catching fish.[CR]Sega Marine Fishing can be played using the Dreamcast fishing rod controller. You could customize your character with hats, shirts, etc.</plot>

        <plot>Sega Marine Fishing is a fishing video game in which the player attempts to catch various marine sport fish. The gameplay's emphasis was on enticing fish to bite onto the lure and then successfully fighting the fish and reeling it to the boat.[CR]As the player catches fish, they earn item cards. Items earned with these cards include fish and artifacts for an aquarium, fishing equipment, additional boats, and various goofy accessories such as different colored shorts. The game also featured two modes of online play: tournament fishing and "fish mail". In tournament fishing, players competed to catch the biggest fish within a species. Fish mail consisted of writing short messages. Players could receive random messages by catching fish.[CR]Sega Marine Fishing can be played using the Dreamcast fishing rod controller. You could customize your character with hats, shirts, etc.</plot>

        <plot>Sega Rally 2 is the sequel to Sega's hit arcade game, Sega Rally. This game, like it's predecessor, is based on Rally racing. Rally racing is unique in that races take place on both race tracks and off-road courses. The courses in this game reflect this nicely. Some take place in the desert or forest, others take place in cities.[CR]The cars in this game are all actual rally cars, with manufacturers from Europe and Japan both well represented. You do not get to see very many of them at one time, however, since rally races are typically time-based events. In this game, you are not competing directly against the other cars, you simply have to have the best time through the course. So, during any race you will usually see a handful of other cars on the track.</plot>

        <plot>Sega Tetris is an officially licensed Tetris game originally made for arcades that can be played in both single player and multi player modes. The game uses polygonal graphics with animated backgrounds. As progress through the game is made these change and take the player to numerous different settings. [CR]When playing alone the game is very much true to the original Tetris but with some differences. The game is played with a joystick for moving the blocks around as they fall and two buttons to rotate them left and right. As the game's level is raised the speed of the falling block will also increase and since it's an arcade game it will reach a high pace relatively early. One addition to the game is a slot machine and the symbol it stops on depends on the number of lines cleared. By matching all the three wheels the player will get a large bonus. [CR]The two player versus mode adds special attacks to the gameplay and these are activated by clearing lines. Clearing two lines will lead to a joint attack where two stuck together blocks will fall while clearing three lines will lead to a long block falling. By creating a tetris (clearing four lines) stacked lines will rise from the bottom of the playfield. Some attacks come from clearing multiple lines that are apart from each other. This includes a missile attack that destroys block and a K.O. attack that knocks out the opponent preventing him from controlling the blocks for a short while. There is also a four player mode where two cabinets are connected. On the Dreamcast version the multiplayer mode can be played online.</plot>

        <plot>Sengoku Turb: Fanfan I love me Dunce-doublentendre (戦国TURB Fanfan I ♥ me Dunce-doublentendre) is a follow-up to Sengoku Turb, also released exclusively in Japan in 1999. It appears to be nothing more than a minigame collection hidden underneath the veil of an RPG.[CR]Sega of Japan's catalogue page refers to the game as Sengoku Turb: Fanfan I love me Dance-doubletendre, correcting the misspelt "dance" but missing a letter from "entendre".[2] It also abbreviates the name to Sengoku Turb F.I.D..</plot>

        <plot>Sentimental Graffiti 2 happens some time after the first game, and instead of high-school setting it fast forwards to college setting. However, the protagonist in this game is 2nd year university student, Kouhei Shiina, whereas the original protagonist from the first game had died in an accident and while he is not present in this game, all the heroines he met in the original game are back in this sequel, ready for the new protagonist to meet them for the very first time and start a relationship. Kouhei is a member of a photography club and is looking for someone who will model for his photo exhibition for the upcoming college festival. That's where twelve heroines come in.[CR]The game is played in both 1st-person and 3rd-person isometric perspective. While 1st-person perspective is used in communication with other characters and looking at places up close, the isometric view is used while traversing the city which features many locations which can be accessed. Both city and locations are affected by the time of day and will feature different graphics during morning, twilight or night, as well as affecting stores and other locations which may be open or closed at the decided time. The map features 29 locations in total, some of which can be further explored from the inside. Your actions cost time and clock progresses whenever you do something or go someplace. By the end of the day, you return to your dorm and continue the exploration the next day.</plot>

        <plot>Seventh Cross: Evolution, known in Japan as simply Seventh Cross, is a video game for the Sega Dreamcast video game console. It was released in Japan on December 23, 1998. A sequel titled Ninth Will was announced shortly after the game's North American release, but it was apparently cancelled.[CR]The theme of Seventh Cross is evolution. The player begins with a protist, and through eating and consuming, progresses through two other stages until it becomes an animal. The game begins in a lagoon, where the player's organism must avoid predators while nourishing itself. If the creature dies, it is returned to its lowest form unless it has successfully evolved into its 'origin' stage, in which case the creature regresses to that instead. After death, any parts gained by evolution are kept, but any gathered food is lost.[CR]Seventh Cross contains six stages, each with a boss. The stages take place in different biomes, ranging from the pond to a barren future.</plot>

After recovering from his injuries Ryu sets out to track down his father's murderer, as well as uncover his family's secrets and the mystery of the Phoenix and Dragon mirrors that Lan Di seeks.[CR]Project Berkley was the code name for Shenmue that was included as a bonus GD-ROM disc with the Virtua Fighter 3tb game for the Sega Dreamcast.

        <plot>The story revolves around Shunhei Yahagi (矢萩 俊平), a 19-year old high-school graduate who failed to enter the college of his choosing. Due to the circumstance, he takes on the role of an assistant teacher in a summer course school managed by Natsumi Yahagi (矢萩 なつみ), his older sister. There he helps younger students, who just happen to be all girls, learn for their exams. While taking the position of an assistant teacher, his relationship with the student, as well as other girls he meets start to evolve.[CR]This romance oriented visual novel adventure game comes with all the expected gameplay elements that are usually found in the genre such as hiding on-screen text in order to see clear background picture or branching story based on player's actions and dialogue choices. The background locations use the processed actual photos, while the characters use typical anime art. Background image is obscured by a frame pattern which makes the location art displayed in widescreen. During the gameplay, the current location, time of day, and the title of a background track currently playing are displayed.</plot>

Not far behind her, Valuan Admiral Alfonso is in hot pursuit under orders from Lord Galcian to capture her. Alfonso opens fire on and disables Fina's ship long enough to capture her before it plummets into Deep Sky, but just as she is being brought onboard his warship, a Blue Rogue vessel arrives with the intent of robbing the Valuan vessel. Vyse and Aika of the Blue Rogues jump from the Albatross onto Alfonso's flagship and fight their way to the rear cargo hold, prompting Alfonso to flee on a lifeboat while leaving Fina behind along with the war beast Antonio, who is quickly defeated by the Rogues. Vyse and Aika bring Fina back to their clan's ship, which Vyse pilots back to their secret hideout, Pirate Island (disguised as a small village).</plot>

The goal is simple: hunt the villains across the globe, thwart their evil plans, and save the world![CR]Like most 3D shooters, Soldier of Fortune consists mainly of exploring the environments and killing the enemies that try to impede the player's progress. It is one of the first shooters to isolate over 20 different body regions and show/inflict damage to those regions. For example, if the player character shoots an enemy in the foot, the enemy will limp. The game was also notable for including realistic gore animations resulting from the injuries sustained by the enemies.</plot>

These emeralds were a source of unlimited power, and consequently it did not take long before wars broke out over who would control the Chaos Emeralds. There was also a Master Emerald, which was the controller of the Chaos Emeralds and could either negate or amplify the Chaos Emerald's power. One of the chao living near the shrine of the Emeralds accidentally made contact with the holy water in the shrine and mutated to become a peaceful creature that could use the power of water called Chaos and became the guardian of the rest of the chaos there. Later on, a tribe of echidnas, led by Pachamac, angered Chaos by attempting to steal the Chaos Emeralds, ruining the sanctuary it was protecting and attempted a mass massacre on the chao living there. They were all but completely destroyed within a single night and Chaos, in his fury, used the negative power of the Chaos Emeralds to transform into Perfect Chaos and slaughtered all the echidnas. Pachamac's daughter, Tikal, had pleaded with Pachamac but he refused to listen to her. Tikal then prayed to the Master Emerald after Perfect Chaos had left to destroy the entire world to seal herself with Chaos inside the Master Emerald.</plot>

        <plot>Sonic Adventure 2: The Trial, not to be confused with Sonic Adventure 2: Trial Version, is a free demo of Sonic Adventure 2 for the Sega Dreamcast, which was bundled with releases of Phantasy Star Online. It is an earlier prototype than Sonic Adventure 2 (Preview).[CR]Sonic Adventure 2: The Trial includes one level (City Escape) from Sonic Adventure 2, with dialogue spoken completely in Japanese, accompanied by English subtitles. The translation for the opening helicopter escape cutscene is also slightly different - in this demo, one of the pilots exclaims, "What the hell?", while in the final version, this line was changed to, "What in the world?".[CR]This demo differs in several ways from the final version, the most notable difference being that Sonic still wears his original trademark shoes. It wasn't until a few months before the retail release of Sonic Adventure 2 that Sonic Team revealed a merchandising deal with Soap Shoes. Other changes in Sonic Adventure 2: The Trial include a different logo, different road-side billboards, different sound effects, looser controls and physics, and an instrumental version of the song, Escape from the City.[CR]When the player waits through the title screen, a video plays. This video shows prototype footage, including Sonic in Sky Rail, which Sonic does not access in the final version of Sonic Adventure 2.</plot>

        <plot>Sonic Adventure International is a Japanese exclusive re-release of the original Sonic Adventure. This re-release was due to Sonic Adventure being rushed to the market in Japan and having several bugs and unimplemented features. The US release had more development time thus the game was closer to what its developers had intended for it to be. Sonic Adventure International is the same as that version, but with added features.[CR]Notably, complete English and Japanese language voice tracks are included, as well as subtitles in English, German, French, and Spanish. There is also a more solid framerate, tweaked cameras, additional voice clips and a number of new download contests (some country-specific). Some graphics were tweaked or changed completely such as the removal of the neon cowgirl billboard from Casinopolis. The World Ranking mode allows people from multiple regions to upload best times to an international scoreboard for prizes.[CR]A demo of this version was made available for rent for a limited time in 1999 called Sonic Adventure: Limited Edition.</plot>

        <plot>Soukou no Kihei: Space Griffon (蒼鋼の騎兵 -SPACE GRIFFON-) is a graphically enhanced version of the earlier computer game Hamlet.[CR]The largest moon base, "Hamlet", has stopped responding to communication. It is up to you to determine what happened, and fix it. The game mixes typical FPS gameplay with RPG elements. You are inside a giant mech that can transform into a shape fit for walking, driving, and a mixture of both. You can move square-by-square, with 90-degree turns, slide left or right, and look up and down. By defeating enemies, the invisible RPG elements are introduced: you have hit points, energy points, and you can collect weapons and items. When an enemy approaches, this is shown through an icon, along with the distance.[CR]The environment is claustrophobic and maze-like, and includes many enemies. The game features an unusually large amount of plot for a game of this type, mostly consisting of conversations between your teammates, who are always in other parts of the station.</plot>

Ulala from Space Channel 5 gets sent to bring in the news, save the hostages and beat the Morolians, while simultaneously fighting off rival reporters Pudding and Jaguar. In the end, it turns out the Morolians were being brainwashed by Space Channel 5's boss, Blank, who desires ratings over the truth. After failing to defeat Ulala with a robot replica named Evila, he pilots a large version to hurt her, but she is rescued by Jaguar, just like he did when she was young. With the aid of her supporters and Fuse's antenna, Ulala uses groove energy to defeat Blank and send him to the other side of the universe.</plot>

        <plot>It's the 25th century. Several lunar cycles have passed since Ulala saved human kind and repelled the Morolian invasion against Earth through dance. Life is quiet too quiet for Ulala until Chief Director 'Space Michael' reports that a mysterious dancing group is forcing innocent bystanders to dance and then whisking them away…Here starts another swinging report show from Ulala![CR]Our intergalactic anchor girl must also must take part in 'Rhythm Battles', where she takes control of a musical instrument and plays in time with her opponent and 'Lyrics Battle', where Ulala gives her singing voice a workout in order to defeat the foes that await her.[CR]A TV channel is only as good as it's last ratings and the same is true of Space Channel 5. Ulala must keep the viewer rating high, failure to do so will lead to the show being cancelled and the plug being pulled on Space Channel 5 - Space Michael is counting on you!</plot>

The same goes for publishers: initially the games were published by Ripcord Games, and later by Take-Two Interactive. Other developers and publishers have since been brought in for spin-off titles and sequels[1][CR]The Spec Ops franchise was intended to introduce a realistic first/third-person shooter experience and immerse the player in a two-man team gameplay. The first two games were well received; and the PlayStation and Dreamcast sequels, developed by Runecraft, received lower review scores.[2] The latest game in the series, Spec Ops: The Line, was highly acclaimed for its narrative, based on the novel Heart of Darkness.</plot>

        <plot>Speed Devils is a series of video games developed by Ubisoft's Montreal studio for Microsoft Windows in 1998 and Dreamcast in 1999. Both Speed Busters: American Highways (also known as just Speed Busters) and Speed Devils are racing games in which the courses feature hazards such as dinosaurs rolling boulders, and UFOs in exotic locales including Louisiana, Louisiana Tornado, New York City, New York City Winter, Mexico, Nevada, Aspen Summer, Aspen Winter, Canada (Supposedly northern Quebec), Canada Light Winter, Canada Heavy Winter, Montreal Industrial, Hollywood, and Hollywood Disaster. The console version's career mode allowed a player to rise a racer through the ranks of a fictional racing league. Colorful rivals would challenge you to accomplish certain feats during races, making accompanying bets using prize money from competition. Money earned from gambling and performance is used to buy cars, upgrade them, and maintain them. There are 4 classes in the game.Each class had 4 people. Starting in Class D, they are Jack, Ms. Penny Parker, Alfanso, and Luigi. Class C has Vanessa, Blue Bullet, James, and Tex. Class B has Billy-Sue Bayou, Cora and Antonio Martinez, and Jake. The top class, Class A, has Cory, Pat, Yu and Driver X. Then you must beat Driver X, the boss of the game. The game also supports five players on one Dreamcast console.</plot>

        <plot>At last! The first Star Wars game for the 128-bit Dreamcast lets you participate in the famous podrace sequence (which was the critical highlight of the 1999 film Star Wars: Episode I, The Phantom Menace). These lightning-quick vehicles are capable of reaching simulated speeds of up to 600 miles per hour, while skimming a mere 4 feet above the ground. You can race alone or against a friend in split-screen mode, on over more than 21 courses among eight worlds. Take the controls as Jedi-to-be Anakin Skywalker, or any one of over 20 podracers, and feel the full-force blast--while avoiding hazards such as methane lakes, meteor showers, and the unfriendly Tusken Raiders.</plot>

        <plot>In Stunt GP, you control one of 16 different remote-controlled cars. The cars are divided in three categories: Wild-Wheels, Speed Demons and Aeroblaster, each with it's unique driving feel. The cars can be tuned up with many different tuning parts, like better batteries, tires, suspension etc. - a total of 1000 different combinations.[CR]You race on 24 original, colorful tracks with tons of bridges, ramps and loopings. You can perform absolutely breathtaking stunts on these tracks, but you need to be careful about the battery - if the car runs out of power, the race is probably over very soon. In each track you can recharge your car's battery by driving through a tunnel above the start/finish line.[CR]Of course, it's possible to play multiplayer. No network support is included, so multiplayer gaming stages on one PC in split screen mode.</plot>

        <plot>In Super Magnetic Neo, a gang lead by evil, foul-mouthed baby Pinki has taken over Pao Pao Park. The professor must stop her, so her sends Super Magnetic Neo, a little boy robot with a powerful electromagnet on his head.[CR]The game has some resemblance to the Crash Bandicoot series in that some levels have you running toward the camera, have a side-view, or have you riding an animal. It contains some running, jumping and switch-flipping much like any 3D platformer. However, it does have a unique magnetism aspect. Positive and Negative charges are represented by red and blue.

        <plot>Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo, known as Super Puzzle Fighter II X (スーパーパズルファイターⅡＸ) in Japan, is a puzzle game similar to the likes of Tetris or Puyo Puyo, developed and published by Capcom. It was brought to the Sega Saturn in 1996.[CR]Despite its name there was never a "Super Puzzle Fighter 1" - it is merely just a play on Capcom's earlier game, Super Street Fighter II Turbo. This being said, the game is actually influenced by Street Fighter Alpha and the Darkstalkers franchise, with most Street Fighter II characters missing. Though characters from both series appear in the game they are not controllable by the player, acting solely as avatars.[CR]Similar to other "falling piece" puzzle games, the aim of Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo is to eliminate your opponent by filling their playfield with blocks (or gems, in this case). In order to achieve this, you must eliminate coloured gems on your side of the play area and produce combos when doing so.[CR]As well as a Saturn port, the game was brought to the Sega Dreamcast in 2001 for Capcom's Matching Service. This version was not released outside of Japan.</plot>

        <plot>Super Street Fighter II X for Matching Service is a fighting game developed by Capcom, and one of many updates to the popular fighting game, Street Fighter II. This version was released for the Sega Dreamcast exclusively in Japan in 2000. It is an enhanced port of Super Street Fighter II X: Grand Master Challenge, known as Super Street Fighter II Turbo in the west.[CR]The game is virtually identical to other ports of Super Street Fighter II X/Super Street Fighter II Turbo, but is compatible with Capcom's "matching service", meaning players can compete online.</plot>

        <plot>Surf Rocket Racers is a jet-ski racing game for the Dreamcast. As in most aquatic racers, success here depends on your ability to smoothly handle unpredictable waves and aggressive competition at the same time.[CR]There are several game modes to choose from. First up is the Championship. In this mode, you compete in a series of circuit races and accumulate points based on your finishing position. The racer with the most points at the end of the season wins. The other modes include a trick competition, a hazard and obstacle course, and a head-to-head 2-player mode.</plot>

        <plot>Surf Rocket Racers is a jet-ski racing game for the Dreamcast. As in most aquatic racers, success here depends on your ability to smoothly handle unpredictable waves and aggressive competition at the same time.[CR]There are several game modes to choose from. First up is the Championship. In this mode, you compete in a series of circuit races and accumulate points based on your finishing position. The racer with the most points at the end of the season wins. The other modes include a trick competition, a hazard and obstacle course, and a head-to-head 2-player mode.</plot>

        <plot>Sydney 2000 offers four modes of play including arcade, Olympic, head-to-head and coaching. Up to four players (human or computer-controlled) can participate in arcade and head-to-head modes. Each player can train or control a team of 12 virtual athletes for whichever nationality he or she chooses. Arcade mode allows you to jump right into any one of the 12 events and test the waters without training your athletes. Two types of play are available: classic and repeat. In classic style, you play all 12 events only once while earning points based on performance in each. Repeat play offers basically the same format with the main difference being the chance to gain higher scores by replaying the events. Olympic mode lets you train a team of 12 athletes, build strength and morale, sharpen skills and prepare for qualification at Olympic trials. This mode offers a 4-stage approach to reaching the goal of Olympic competition: training, invitation, championship, and then the Games themselves. Gymnastics and field and track are just a couple of the activities practiced in this mode.</plot>

        <plot>Sydney 2000 offers four modes of play including arcade, Olympic, head-to-head and coaching. Up to four players (human or computer-controlled) can participate in arcade and head-to-head modes. Each player can train or control a team of 12 virtual athletes for whichever nationality he or she chooses. Arcade mode allows you to jump right into any one of the 12 events and test the waters without training your athletes. Two types of play are available: classic and repeat. In classic style, you play all 12 events only once while earning points based on performance in each. Repeat play offers basically the same format with the main difference being the chance to gain higher scores by replaying the events. Olympic mode lets you train a team of 12 athletes, build strength and morale, sharpen skills and prepare for qualification at Olympic trials. This mode offers a 4-stage approach to reaching the goal of Olympic competition: training, invitation, championship, and then the Games themselves. Gymnastics and field and track are just a couple of the activities practiced in this mode.</plot>

        <plot>Taxi 2 is a driving game, based on Luc Besson's movie. Both movie and video game share the same title.[CR]Taxi 2 features two game modes. The "story mode" follows the scenes from the movie and allows you to select from five missions. When a mission is completed, you can save your progress, but also play it in the "arcade mode". In this mode, you will face the same competitor, Jean-Louis Schlesser ! The objective is no longer specific to each mission, but is to win the race, after several laps. In this mode, you will not have to care about the temperature gauge, since it is removed from arcade mode.</plot>

Beating the opponent cars will open up a new series of Challenge tracks. The Time Attack mode pits the racer against the clock. Victory in the Time Attack mode will unleash a new fleet of cars.[CR]The Championship mode is a little bit deeper. In it, the player will participate in an entire racing season, culminating in the famous 24 Heures Du Mans. The Championship mode starts with the GT2 class of car. Upon beating the first series of races, the player will be able to move on to the other car types. Finally, Le Mans offers the Le Mans 24 hr mode. In game time, the Le Mans race lasts the entire 24-hr. period. The player can choose to shorten the outcome by resetting the game time. Be careful, though, as the car can take a l</plot>

        <plot>Tetris 4D (テトリス フォーディー) is a Sega Dreamcast game developed and published by Bullet Proof Software. It is an entry in the Tetris series, and was released only in Japan.[CR]Being an early Dreamcast game, Tetris 4D does not deviate much from its predecessors. There is a classic mode (which acts as a normal game of Tetris) and a "battle" mode (which allows up to four players to compete against each other). The game has an industrial/urban theme, unlike most other entries in the series which usually have a classical architecture or Russian theme.[CR]There are no AI players in the game and no VMU support for high-score saving. Both Sega Tetris and The Next Tetris: On-Line Edition (both also released for the Dreamcast) are seen as better games as a result.</plot>

        <plot>Tokyo Xtreme Racer, known as Shutokō Battle (首都高バトル) in Japan and Tokyo Highway Challenge in Europe, is a racing video game for the Sega Dreamcast. Released in 1999 as one of the console's launch titles, the game was one of the first mission-based racing games. The gameplay involves the player challenging other drivers on the Shuto Expressway in order to gain money to modify and enhance his or her car. The game features a wide variety of Japanese cars and tuning parts to purchase as the player progresses through rivals.[CR]When released in Japan, Shutokō Battle was one of the best selling Dreamcast titles at this time. The game is based on illegal highway racing in Tokyo's Wangan highway with custom tuned cars. A such phenomenon is growing popular in Japan since the 90's with its dedicated manga (Shutokō Battle's biggest inspiration being Wangan Midnight), anime series and video games (C1 Circuit, Wangan Trial, Naniwa Wangan Battle).</plot>

        <plot>Following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the economic situation in Russia and the former Eastern Europe falls into chaos. Terrorism in the region is commonplace as people fight a seemingly endless stream of battles for supplies and other necessities. In this power vacuum though a dangerous a situation arises: the Russian mafia has begun buying up surplus military equipment with the assistance of current members of the Russian Army. During one such arms deal Rainbow forces raid the meeting grounds and recover weapons grade plutonium, tracing the fissile material to a nearby naval base.</plot>

        <plot>A few days after the events described in Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation, Lara Croft is presumed dead. Her close friends begin to recollect her previous adventures, which occurred during different periods of her life. These include searching for the Philosopher's Stone in Rome; preventing the Spear of Destiny from falling into the hands of a ruthless gang leader; facing monsters on the Black Isle of Ireland as a child; and, finally, infiltrating a high-tech complex in pursuit of the Iris artefact. Like its predecessors, Tomb Raider: Chronicles is an action game with puzzle-solving and platforming elements. The gameplay is very similar to that of the previous games, with the addition of a few new skills. Lara can now walk on tightropes, swing on horizontal bars, and somersault forwards from a ledge while crouching. A grappling hook has been added to her inventory. The game also includes a level editor, allowing the player to create new stages for Lara to explore.</plot>

        <plot>Lara Croft faces the great dangers of an unleashed Egyptian god in her fourth tomb raiding adventure. Last Revelation's redesigned inventory system gives Tomb Raider brand-new gameplay. Combined with Lara's new moves and abilities, gameplay features greater scope than ever before. Clear objectives and smaller locations result in less time spent traveling between areas. Individual environments are more reminiscent of the original game - tightly focused and puzzle-orientated, but with higher levels of detail and a greater number of objects than seen before. An emphasis on ancient locations and tombs allows mystery, suspense and characteristic atmosphere to play key roles throughout.</plot>

        <plot>A few days after the events described in Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation, Lara Croft is presumed dead. Her close friends begin to recollect her previous adventures, which occurred during different periods of her life. These include searching for the Philosopher's Stone in Rome; preventing the Spear of Destiny from falling into the hands of a ruthless gang leader; facing monsters on the Black Isle of Ireland as a child; and, finally, infiltrating a high-tech complex in pursuit of the Iris artefact. Like its predecessors, Tomb Raider: Chronicles is an action game with puzzle-solving and platforming elements. The gameplay is very similar to that of the previous games, with the addition of a few new skills. Lara can now walk on tightropes, swing on horizontal bars, and somersault forwards from a ledge while crouching. A grappling hook has been added to her inventory. The game also includes a level editor, allowing the player to create new stages for Lara to explore.</plot>

        <plot>Lara Croft faces the great dangers of an unleashed Egyptian god in her fourth tomb raiding adventure. Last Revelation's redesigned inventory system gives Tomb Raider brand-new gameplay. Combined with Lara's new moves and abilities, gameplay features greater scope than ever before. Clear objectives and smaller locations result in less time spent traveling between areas. Individual environments are more reminiscent of the original game - tightly focused and puzzle-orientated, but with higher levels of detail and a greater number of objects than seen before. An emphasis on ancient locations and tombs allows mystery, suspense and characteristic atmosphere to play key roles throughout.</plot>

        <plot>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater is a skateboarding simulation in which you control a famous skate star around 3D environments. Each game area contains a plethora of objects like ramps, rails, and half-pipes which can be used to perform tricks. Each trick you perform earns you more points for your score.[CR]The game is divided into two types of levels. In the first, you skate around locations like a mall, a city street, or a warehouse. In each of these areas, there are 5 goals to complete. Some goals involve obtaining a high score, others smashing objects, and some collecting objects. For every goal you complete, you earn a video tape. By collecting enough video tapes, you unlock levels and skateboards for you to use. There are 6 levels like this. The second type of level is a competition. You get to make 3 timed runs through a skate park, and attempt to get the highest score possible. If you do well enough, you will beat the scores of the computer controlled skaters and win a medal. There are 3 levels like this.[CR]There are nine real life pro skaters you can choose to play as, including Tony Hawk himself. Each skater has their own signature moves that earn you big points if pulled off successfully.</plot>

It was released on July 20, 2003 for Windows using the NScripter engine. The Dreamcast and PlayStation 2 versions were released by Alchemist in 2004. An anime adaptation was broadcast in Japan in 2004, and originally ran from June 30, to September 22.The title references a haiku by Yosa Buson: "Nanohana ya tsuki wa higashi ni hi wa nishi ni."[CR]Naoki Kazumi is a boy whose parents died in an accident five years ago, and his memory went along with it. Since he had nowhere else to go, he lives with his cousin Matsuri Shibugaki and her parents. Every morning before school, he is awakened by his childhood friend, Honami Fujieda, who keeps telling him that he is not a child anymore, but still comes to wake him up. These usual, ordinary days seem to stretch on forever, until one day up on the school's rooftop, while Naoki is taking a peaceful nap, out of nowhere, a girl falls out of the sky. This girl, called Mikoto Amagasaki, comes from 100 years in the future, and she went back in time with the intention of finding her brother. When Mikoto sees Naoki, she mistakes him for her brother.</plot>

Spring must return to Shunkashu Island, and for that reason the fight is beginning: The Great Snow War.[CR]Daisessen is a strategy game very similar to the board game classic Battleship.

        <plot>A unique combination of vertically-scrolling shooters and competitive puzzle games, Twinkle Star Sprites tells the story of the apprentice witch Ran, who searches for the fabled Twinkle Star that is said to grant any wish to the one that finds it. Unfortunately she is not the only one seeking the star, and thus must fight her way and defeat all the other characters that seek the star in shooter duels.[CR]The game plays mostly as a vertically-scrolling shooter, with you controlling your avatar and attempting to shoot and avoid the incoming enemies. The difference in this game is that each player has his own play area, a la Puyo Puyo, and the enemies cause splash damage around themselves when shot. Thus chaining the destruction of several enemies creates a combo that performs an attack move on your opponent. These moves can range from targeted fireballs, to special moves unique to each character, to the summoning of special "boss" characters that the other player must destroy before continuing.[CR]Each player has a lifebar, and as with most shooters there are bombs, and collectible power-ups to be found. The game features an arcade mode in which you can freely select what character you want to control, as well as a 2-player Vs mode and a story mode chronicling Ran's journey.</plot>

        <plot>The Typing of the Dead (ザ・タイピング・オブ・ザ・デッド Za Taipingu Obu Za Deddo?) is an arcade game that was developed by WOW Entertainment and published by Sega for the NAOMI hardware. The game was released in Japanese arcades in 1999 and was ported to the Sega Dreamcast in 2001 by Smilebit. A Windows version was released in 2000 and a PlayStation 2 port followed in 2004.[CR]The Typing of the Dead is a modification of Sega's 1998 light gun arcade game The House of the Dead 2 in which the gun is replaced by a computer keyboard. The player takes the role of a secret agent in a zombie-infested Venice and must quickly type letters, words and phrases in order to kill fast-advancing enemies.[CR]Despite falling under the criteria of "edutainment", the game was lauded by mainstream game critics for its humor, difficulty and originality. The PC version of The Typing of the Dead sold 120,000 units in 2003.[CR]A Sony PlayStation 2 port was called The Typing of the Dead: Zombie Panic. This version was released exclusively in Japan in late December 2004 and was packaged with a USB keyboard. The game was mostly unchanged, although the Dreamcast backpacks were replaced with PS2 backpacks and new minigames were incorporated into the main story.[5][6] A sequel, The Typing of the Dead 2, was released exclusively in Japan in 2007. English of the Dead, another revision of House of the Dead 2, was released as a language-learning game for the Nintendo DS in Japan in 2008.[7] In 2012, an iOS remake was released entitled Flick of the Dead.[8] Typing of the Dead: Overkill, based on The House of the Dead: Overkill, was released on Microsoft Windows in October 2013.</plot>

        <plot>This is essentially the same game as the arcade light-gun rail-shooter House of the Dead 2, except they've turned it into a edu-tainment typing trainer. Instead of guns, your characters have keyboards strapped to them, and instead of shooting the zombies that constantly jump out at you you'll need to type out the words attached to the zombies in order to kill them before they crack open your head and feast upon the goo inside. The game ranks you on your typing speed and provides various tutorials and other edu-tainment sundries.[CR]Otherwise it's pretty much the same game as House of the Dead 2. Much like the Resident Evil series, the zombie hordes have gone from infesting a vaguely gothic creepy old mansion to infesting a vaguely gothic decaying city, and its your job to stop them and save the human race (as usual).</plot>

        <plot>Ultimate Fighting Championship is based on the no-holds-barred martial art tournament of the same name. What makes the game (and the real-life counterpart) distinct from wrestling, boxing, and other fights is the variety of fighting styles in use; it is perfectly possible to end up with a judo master facing a kickboxer.[CR]The actual gameplay is simple enough. You have various basic moves, combos, holds, and so on. The complications come in the form of the huge list of moves, featuring many different styles. Hit your opponent until he gets knocked out, or force him to tap out early.</plot>

        <rom name="chd_dc/CHD-Dreamcast/Under Defeat (Japan).chd" size="218975314"/>
        <plot>Under Defeat is a shoot 'em up arcade game by G.rev. It was released for the Sega Dreamcast in March 2006. The game takes place in an alternate reality based on World War II, and, in a controversial twist, players control German-speaking characters (under the banner of "the Empire"), fighting against enemies ("the Union") that speak English and possess weapons patterned after those of both real-life Allied and Axis powers (for example, naval units in Level 2 bear heavy resemblance toward the Imperial Japanese warships). The game was released very late in the life of the Dreamcast, but sold much better than expected, probably because there were no other home ports planned in the foreseeable future.[CR]Players assume control of a helicopter, which can be rotated like a more limited version of the mechanism in Zero Gunner 2. Gameplay is largely very traditional, and bears a strong resemblance to some older Toaplan games, especially Twin Cobra. It uses 3D graphics, and a slightly angled perspective to give the game more depth than most other titles in the genre.[CR]On October 27, 2011, G.rev announced a remake titled Under Defeat HD to be released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.[1] The game is released by Rising Star Games on February 23, 2012 in Japan, November 9, 2012 in the UK and set to be released on November 28, 2012 in North America for PlayStation 3 only and January 25, 2013 in Europe. The Xbox 360 version for North America was released on August 26, 2014 as a downloadable game-only under Games on Demand. An upgraded version of Under Defeat HD (PS3, Xbox 360) was made on Sega Ring Edge 2 arcade System, named Under Defeat HD+. Now that version is coming to arcades with some improvements via Sega’s ALL.NET. Among the enhancements this will have is a horizontal orientation mode, more detail in the battlefield and a “New Order” mode where apparently you can choose from different types of aircraft.</plot>

        <plot>The events of this game take place in the near future. You are cast in the role of a young woman named Kei, a police officer who specializes in counter-terrorist activities. One day she and her boyfriend (also a policeman) receive an assignment to investigate a murder that occurred in a hotel. The investigation gradually leads to a confrontation with a mysterious evil man who seems to know a lot about Kei's past, which was concealed from her...[CR]The game is a third-person shooter with strong elements of survival horror, somewhat similar to Fear Effect games. Kei uses guns in order to dispatch of the enemies. She can side-step and roll to avoid the enemies' attacks. Ammunition and health kits are rare, and there is a possibility to steal them from the enemies. Kei can communicate with the police station by using her cat, which is a disguised communication device.</plot>

        <plot>Unreal Tournament is completely different from Unreal: it is now mainly based on multiplayer, like Quake 3.[CR]At the beginning, you have to play classic deathmatch rounds. After you have successfully won some of them, a new game mode becomes available, domination. In domination there are about three or four different areas scattered around the map to be controlled by your team. For a certain amount of seconds you control one area, a point is added to your score. The more areas you control, the faster your team's score rises. When you or the other team reaches a certain score, the game is over. The third mode is called capture the flag, every team has a flag to defend and tries to capture the other team's flag to score a point.[CR]The fourth game mode is called assault. This mode requires completion of real missions, such as attacking an enemy base and destroying a specific object in it. Again, there are two teams, the defenders and the attackers. You have to complete the mission in a certain time, for example five or ten minutes. If you were successful, your team has to defend this time and the other team attacks. But the attacking team now only has as much time as you needed to attack.[CR]All these modes are either playable in single or multiplayer mode. If playing alone, you have a large menu with orders you can give your bots. Also, all weapons were redesigned, and some new ones are added.</plot>

The game uses the CPS-2 system - the same as Street Fighter Alpha series, which makes the gameplay of these two titles very similar.[CR]The game is also an installment in the Darkstalkers franchise, presenting a collection of all eighteen characters and four different play modes available in the series. Like in the previous games, the playable characters are monsters and supernatural creatures, such as vampires, werewolves, demons, zombies and mummies, instead of regular boxers or kung-fu and karate fighters.</plot>

The main difference between Vanishing Point and countless other racers is that you are never racing directly against other cars, but rather are racing against the clock. Your position at the end of the race depends solely on your time, not on your finishing position relative to other cars. What's more, there are loads of computer controlled cars that are there simply to slow you down.</plot>

        <plot>Vanishing Point is an arcade style racer featuring real cars and road course style tracks. The main difference between Vanishing Point and countless other racers is that you are never racing directly against other cars, but rather are racing against the clock. Your position at the end of the race depends solely on your time, not on your finishing position relative to other cars. What's more, there are loads of computer controlled cars that are there simply to slow you down.</plot>

        <plot>Virtua Fighter 3tb (Team Battle) is a port of the arcade game Virtua Fighter 3 to the Dreamcast. The "tb" adds a team battle mode which was not present in the coin-op. For those that do not know, the Virtua Fighter series is your classic beat-em-up, with a bunch of characters all trying to kick, punch, throw and body slam the bejesus out of each other. Each of the characters has over a hundred possible moves and the game plays very faithfully to the original. The game features interesting arena to fight in which are more like real locations in they are not flat and some parts can be broken away during the match.</plot>

        <plot>Directly translated from the popular arcade stand-up, Virtua Tennis offers a light-year jump from the Pong-style tennis of yesteryear. Sporting rich 3-D graphics, crisp animation, and realistic sound effects, you'll swear you're courtside at a grand slam. But, thanks to the game's simple controls, you won't have to spend years at a tennis camp just learning a backhand. The game features hard-top, grass, and clay surfaces, all with distinct ball-bounce and sound responses. Choose one of eight internationally ranked tennis pros and play against advanced computer opponents, or plug an extra controller in and play a friend head to head. Just as in real championships, ball boys, chair umps, and even spectators react to your game.</plot>

        <plot>Kei is a computer engineer. One day he walks into an internet bar. As he is checking his e-mails, he notices an unknown e-mail with an attachment. That takes him to a site called "Cat's Eyes". There he sees a movie of a man being killed. Not giving it a second though, he dismisses that as a game to pass time. Next day, he sees the exact same murder on the TV news.[CR]Most of the game is happening on a fictional OS desktop where you can further access pre-defined set of applications. Web lets you access 18 different web channels with over 150 home pages which contain various things and mini-games, some to move the story forward, some just to create more believable atmosphere. Mail system keeps all the received e-mails notifying you of new ones and those you read, with ability to delete them if you wish. Data application consists of files and movies. It lets you watch all the movies you have seen so far. The remaining applications are more system oriented, config lets you change game configuration (field, speed, sound, and screen), and the file application is used to save or load a savegame file.</plot>

        <plot>This is a fighting parody of the show, called Who Wants to Beat Up a Millionaire? In WWTBUAM, you answer questions and get an opportunity to beat one of five in-game millionaires half to death in order to drain his or her bank account and fill your pockets. The show is hosted by Egregious Phillin, who for all intents and purposes is Regis Philbin, only fatter, louder, and more annoying. The game also has its own clever variation on the show's lifelines, here called Lifeboats.</plot>

        <plot>Wind and Water: Puzzle Battles is - as already indicated by its name - a puzzle game, similar to games like Puzzle Quest or the Bejeweled series. Your goal is to adjust blocks of different colors using a "cursor" comprehending of four blocks so that they form a diamond pattern. If this case occurs, all blocks of the same color touching the diamond will disappear. The blocks above the empty space will now drop and the empty space at the top is filled with new blocks.[CR]The game has a strong focus on combos, among others full combos (cleaning all blocks of one color in one move), elementals (bursting at least two different colors in one move), chains (when the dropping blocks form another diamond) or time combos (finishing another combo within a time frame).[CR]An outstanding feature of the game is the story mode, where you travel over a world map similar to Super Mario World. Behind each waypoint you will usually find a puzzle, but you may also discover a minigame or other special locations (like shops). The stages are connected with a funny and self-ironic storyline, among others containing the developers of the game as the protagonists.[CR]Apart from the story mode the game also features an arcade and an puzzle mode, the first one enabling you to play alone, against a friend or the CPU, the later offering preset playfields, which have to be cleared within a limited number of moves.[CR]For the Dreamcast version of the game it was possible to pre-order a custom sprite character which can be unlocked in the game.</plot>

It was the first game in the modern series to be featured on the Dreamcast, and was the spiritual successor to World Series Baseball for the Sega Genesis.[citation needed] It was released in July 2000 to coincide with the 2000 Major League Baseball All-Star Game in Atlanta.[citation needed][CR]World Series Baseball 2K1 featured a cutting-edge graphical presentation adapted from the NAOMI game Super Major League, and its visuals were well ahead of any other baseball game at the time. Unfortunately, a lack of features, shoddy audio presentation, and major gameplay flaws meant that WSB2K1 was not well received by critics despite its fantastic graphics. The game is notorious for its sometimes-unresponsive controls, as well as the fact that manual fielding—a staple of baseball games for a half-decade prior to WSB2K1's release—isn't even an option available to players.[citation needed][CR]After the debacle that was World Series Baseball 2K1, Sega decided to bring Visual Concepts (the developer behind the Dreamcast's far more successful NBA 2K and NFL 2K series) in for the next version of the game. The result was World Series Baseball 2K2, a game that was considered a major improvement over WSB2K1.</plot>

        <plot>Worms World Party is an artillery game, which is a type of Turn-based strategy game. Like its predecessors, Worms World Party involves controlling a team of worms and using a collection of weaponry to eliminate the opposing team(s). The worms can walk and jump around and use tools such as the ninja rope and parachute to move to otherwise unreachable locations. The worms have an arsenal of dozens of weapons, ranging from longbows to bazookas and from fireball to Holy Hand Grenades. There are also an array of special weapons, such as Armageddon (meteor shower) or the end-all, be-all Concrete Donkey.</plot>

  * There are some adjustments in the scenario and ending
[CR]
  * The ported art is of same quality but does not go beyond erotic in content
[CR]
  * Console version features full voice-acting for the characters

        <plot>Yukawa Moto Senmu no Otakara Sagashi (or "Former Director Yukawa's Treasure Hunt" as the title translates to) was a promotional game released by Sega where 10,000 applicants could win a prize of ¥10,000 each. To do this the players had to use clues presented on the internet (using the Orange Dreamkey CD for internet access). All that was needed to enter was to purchase the game at certain retailers for the low price of ¥980. The promotional period was between March 20 through April 11, 1999.[CR]In the game the player is cast as Sega's former Senior Managing Director Hidekazu Yukawa, presented as a cartoon character. From a top-down perspective the player navigates between different screens and using a limited amount of digs with a shovel, Yukawa needs to find certain pieces of puzzles (all with a Dreamcast theme) to match the online hints given through the internet via the Dreamcast. If he manages to complete the correct picture, the player was eligible to enter the raffle where the prize money was at stake.[CR]There is also a VMU mini-game included which could be downloaded to aid further in the quest and make digging for treasure faster.</plot>

        <plot>In the near future, scientists working for the powerful Asian conglomerate known as Igem have discovered a new energy source. Refusing to share their technique with the rest of the world, Igem eventually developed a weather control machine named ONI, which they intend to use for the purpose of global domination. A squadron of ace helicopter pilots, called Zero Gunner, is assembled to destroy ONI - but Igem fights back with everything they've got...[CR]Zero Gunner 2 is a top-down shooter. All backdrops and vehicles in this game are modelled in 3D, though the gameplay mostly follows the conventions of 2D shooters. Since your craft is a helicopter, a "target and spin" feature has been added, whereby you can both rotate your craft to attack an enemy more efficiently, or alternatively lock on a particular point in space and rotate around it while still firing. These actions are not automatically executed, and are controlled by the player; in order to succeed, mastering this feature is imperative.[CR]The usual power-ups and boss enemy battles are included in the game, along with a selection of helicopters to choose from.</plot>

Two modes are available: a standard "championship" mode in which you simply race around a track, and a "battle" mode which adds weapons into the mix. A split-screen two-player mode is also supported.</plot>

        <plot>deSpiria is an RPG adventure that takes place in the futuristic Japan of 2070. Twenty-two years after the World War III, an organization known as Church has taken power. You play as Allure Valentine, a girl who was recruited by the Church as an undercover agent. On one of her missions, Allure boards a train that crashes shortly thereafter. Her first task will be to find a way out of the underground tunnel and to discover who or what was behind that crash.[CR]The game is a RPG with elements of pure adventure. The entire game is viewed from first-person perspective. You fight enemies in turn-based battles, but instead of usual party you have several "minds", a kind of summoned monsters who will fight together with Allure. They will heal or attack the enemy using special "mind attacks" of various elements - love, curse, etc. In adventure mode, you explore the environments by pressing the A button, which will highlight objects you can interact with. The movements are shown as short CG sequences, similar to many Western-style adventures.</plot>
