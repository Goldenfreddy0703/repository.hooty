		<emu_comment>The Watara Supervision (also known as the QuickShot Supervision in the UK) is a monochrome handheld game console, originating from Asia, and introduced in 1992 as a cut-price competitor for Nintendo's Game Boy. It came packaged with a game called Crystball, which is similar to Breakout. One unique feature of the Supervision was that it could be linked up to a television via a link cable. Games played in this way would display in four colors, much like Nintendo's Super Game Boy add-on for the SNES.[CR]Up against Nintendo's list of popular franchises (Zelda, Mario, Metroid) and those of its third parties (Castlevania, Mega Man) - all of which eventually surfaced on the Game Boy - the Supervision's games were of little interest to most.[CR]Developer:  Watara[CR]Manufacturer:  Watara[CR]CPU:  8-bit 65C02 clocked at 4MHz[CR]Sound:  2 Tonal and 1 Noise Channel plus additional audio DMA stereo output channel[CR]Display:  160×160 pixel resolution, 4 shades of grey[CR]Media:  Cartridge[CR]Max.

		<plot>[I]Brain Power[/I] is a collection of four primarily logic-and-puzzle minigames:[CR]
  * [I]Mine Detector[/I], a clone of Minesweeper. The player is presented with a board filled with mines, and must find all of the open squares without clicking on any of the mines. Open squares contain a number, which indicates how many of the adjacent squares contains a mine. There are easy (55 mines), medium (66 mines), and hard (77 mines) modes.
[CR]
  * [I]Fortune Four[/I], a version of the board game [I]Qubic[/I], also known as 3-D Tic-Tac-Toe. The player takes turn with the computer placing stones on a 4x4x4 grid, the goal being to create a chain of four stones in any direction.
[CR]
  * [I]Caterpillar[/I], a clone of Snake. The player controls a snake that must avoid obstacles and eat food placed around the level. When the snake eats a piece of food, it grows longer, but if it runs into an obstacle or its own body, it dies.
[CR]
  * [I]Hopper[/I], a version of the board game [I]Peg Solitaire[/I]. The player is given a grid with marbles arranged on it, and can remove marbles by "jumping" over them with an adjacent marble. The goal is to only have a single marble remaining. There are seven different layouts to choose from.

		<plot>Bubble World is a simple arcade action game similar to Bubble Bobble. The player controls a small creature that can jump and shoot bubbles. The objective is to use the bubbles to capture and destroy all the enemies on each stage. Defeated enemies will often release items that may award bonus points, or even destroy all enemies on the screen. When all enemies have been defeated, the player moves on to the next stage. However, if the player touches an enemy or a flame bubble, a life is lost.</plot>

There are many enemies in the cave, which must be either fought or avoided, as well as treasure chests that contain useful items such as fire to destroy enemies, a small plane to move elsewhere in the room, and hearts to refill the player's health. There are four different caves to choose from, each with multiple difficulty levels; increasing the difficulty will increase the complexity of the generated cave, as well as the number of treasures that must be collected before the exit will appear.</plot>

The player controls a tank which moves continually forward, and can freely move about the screen firing in any direction; the tank's cannon can be rotated independently of its movement. Enemy tanks appear from all sides, shooting at the player, and must be destroyed or avoided. At the end of each stage, a large boss appears that must be defeated to continue. Power-ups will occasionally appear that will allow the tank to fire in multiple directions simultaneously, but these are lost if the tank takes a hit.</plot>

		<plot>A strange alien spacecraft has been discovered orbiting the Earth, it its weaponry primed and ready to destroy the planet. Your mission: To infiltrate the craft, disable the weapons, initiate the self-destruct sequence, and escape with your life.[CR]Chimera is an isometric adventure game set on an uninhabited space ship. The player must explore the ship, which is divided into a grid of rooms. There are various items scattered around the maze-like craft, which will be either a help or a hindrance. For example, food and water will keep the player alive, while radiators will quickly deplete water reserves while standing in the same room.[CR]The only actions the player can perform are to move and to interact with objects. Many objects — such as electric fences, or the aforementioned radiators — are deadly to the touch unless the player has the correct item in their possession. The ultimate goal is to prime and activate the four-stage self destruct sequence in the correct order by using items found on the ship. A scrolling message indicator at the bottom of the screen provides useful status information.</plot>

However, as the cube moves by rotating onto different sides, the cannon will reorient whenever the cube moves. The goal of each stage is to collect all the fruit, while avoiding insects. Insects can be destroyed by the cannon... but only if it's firing in the right direction! Some stages feature power-ups that will allow the cube to fire in multiple directions simultaneously, or to shoot larger pellets that can hit multiple targets.[CR]The NES release also includes a stage edit mode.</plot>

Curiously, using the girl's ESP powers does not consume energy; rather, switching between shot types does, meaning she can only switch a certain number of times on each stage. Different enemies are weak to different weapons, and each stage ends with a large boss that must be defeated to continue.</plot>

Completing missions will earn money, which can be spent between missions to upgrade the player's craft, as well as replenish missiles and fuel. If the player runs out of fuel, which is also depleted from taking hits, the game is over.</plot>

As in most any scrolling shoot-'em-up, the goal is to reach the end of each stage and destroy the boss, defeating enemies and collecting power-ups along the way. Some enemies drop capsules, which when collected will increment the power-up bar at the bottom of the screen; press the power-up button to collect the selected item and reset the bar. There are six types of upgrades available, including a speed-up, a shield, three types of weapon upgrades, and an Option unit that mimic's the ship's movement, providing another source of fire.</plot>

Flash mode requires the player to clear a specific, flashing block, which may be buried under multiple other blocks.

		<plot>Hero Hawk is a top-down action game similar to Sega's Crack Down, in which the player must infiltrate enemy strongholds and plant bombs at certain locations. Each mission is divided into interconnected rooms, which each contain various hazards, enemy soldiers, item containers, and of course bomb markers. When all bombs on a stage have been planted, the boss area opens up, and the player must defeat the boss to complete the mission.[CR]There are a large variety of items that can be found within missions. Food will refill the player's life, grenades will grant an extra screen-clearing bomb, ammunition will let the player shoot faster, boots will increase walking speed, and the ever-useful SuperVision console will let the player access a map of the stage, which indicates which rooms still need bombs placed. However, if the player takes too many hits and dies, all power-ups are lost. There are only a limited number of continues.</plot>

The goal of each stage is to collect enough gold bars, which will end the stage immediately. Enemies can be defeated with a single bomb blast, but can also defeat the hero just as easily. The game includes five different worlds, each with their own enemy types and setting.</plot>

The player controls the boy in a maze made up of blocks, which can be kicked to make them slide. The goal is to use the blocks to crush all the mice on the stage, but if the player takes too long more mice will appear. It is also possible to kick the walls, which will stun any mice next to that wall. Touching a mouse directly will cause the player to lose a life. Once all the mice have been killed, the player moves on to the next stage.</plot>

		<plot>Pacific Battle is a turn-based naval tactics game. The player controls a fleet of ships and aircraft, including submarines, destroyers, and fighter jets, against a similarly-equipped enemy fleet on a tile-based map. Each unit type has different abilities and attacks; jets for example are quick and capable of long-range attack, but have little armor and are weak to gunfire, while submarines are invisible except to submarines, and are effective against surface ships. The goal of each map is to destroy the enemy fleet while keeping the player's fleet intact. It is only possible to play against the computer, and the game is saved with passwords.</plot>

The player controls a curiously-sentient underground pump which must collect food and objects hidden within a variety of mazes. There are various objects that move around the maze to help or hinder the player: food items can be eaten for bonus points; creatures can be eaten with the head, but will kill the player if they touch the body; and bombs are harmless to the body, but will kill the head if eaten. The only controls are to extend the head in an open direction, and to quickly retract the tube to the surface.</plot>

Stones of various shapes and sizes fall from the top of the screen, and you need to move and rotate the stones so they fill complete lines at the bottom of the screen.

If you get in trouble, there are a limited number of bombs that can be used to clear a small section of stones at the bottom hopefully giving you more room to work with. Unlike the square and rectangular shaped pieces found in [I]Tetris[/I], each of the shapes in [I]Pyramid[/I] have one or more angles to them making complete lines more difficult to form.</plot>

The player can place pipe tiles on the screen toward this end, though each piece of pipe costs money which must also be collected on each stage. There are several other differences from the game's inspiration: there are no cross pieces, the only penalty for replacing a piece is the cost of the pipe, two different pipe pieces are held at any time, and there are also rocks which can be pushed around that playfield that will block the path and destroy pipes.</plot>

		<plot>Sssnake is a basic Snake game. The player controls a snake in a small room filled with food and obstacles. The goal is to eat all the food while avoiding the obstacles, but whenever the snake eats a piece of food, it grows longer, making it more difficult to maneuver. The snake moves forward at a constant speed and can be turned in the four cardinal directions. Holding a button will make the snake move faster, making it harder to control, but increasing the potential for a time bonus.[CR]In this particular version, there are a number of apples on each stage. When an apple is eaten, it disappears, and an apple core appears elsewhere on the stage, and when the apple core is eaten, a deadly skull appears somewhere else. The player must eat all of the apples and apple cores in one run; they will all be reset if the snake touches an obstacle. The player will also earn bonus points if all the normal apples are eaten before any apple core is eaten.</plot>

		<plot>[I]Super Pang[/I] is a clone of the arcade game of the same title. The premise is simple: there are balloons bouncing around a room, and you must shoot and destroy them without getting hit. However, it's not that simple; when shot, the balloons will split into two smaller balloons, and only the smallest size will be destroyed when hit. There are several power-ups that will randomly appear to aid the player, including long-lasting shots, quick-fire shots, and scrolls that instantly reduce all balloons on the screen to the smallest size. Pop enough balloons to move onto the next stage.</plot>

		<plot>Witty Cat is a clone of the 1984 Namco coin-op Mappy. The game stars a mouse in a house full of cats, who must steal all the food in the house without getting caught. The house is divided into floors, which can be reached by using trampolines set up in vertical passages. Both the cats and the mouse can use the trampolines to move around, though the cats are only dangerous when the mouse is on solid ground. If the mouse is able to collect all the food, the stage is cleared and the player moves on to the next area.</plot>
