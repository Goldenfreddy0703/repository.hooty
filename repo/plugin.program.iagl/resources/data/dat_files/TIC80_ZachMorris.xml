    <emu_comment>TIC-80 is a fantasy computer for making, playing and sharing tiny games.[CR]There are built-in tools for development: code, sprites, maps, sound editors and the command line, which is enough to create a mini retro game. At the exit you will get a cartridge file, which can be stored and played.[CR]To make a retro styled game the whole process of creation takes place under some technical limitations: 240x136 pixels display, 16 color palette, 256 8x8 color sprites, 4 channel sound, etc.</emu_comment>

    <plot>Kingpug asked me to add a stereoscopic 3D visual to 8-bit Panda "Virtual Boy" Edition on his live stream, but the problem is that TIC-80 is only 2D. TIC-80 cannot blend sprites/maps to do the 3D anaglyph visual.[CR]To compensate for this, I pre-made a mod of 8-bit Panda with shades of red and cyan colors, giving it the feel of a stereoscopic eye-masking effect on certain graphics in the game. But at least you cannot experience true 3D effects, like what's possible on the real Virtual Boy. :(</plot>

    <plot>I decided to do this because of fun.[CR]Though the Virtual Boy is only capable of displaying black and 3 shades of red at any given moment, 8-bit Panda "Virtual Boy" Edition uses a linear scale of red colors, hence the quotation used.[CR]If you don't know what the Virtual Boy was, it was a failed 32-bit system from Nintendo, which came out in Japan and the US in 1995, to predate the Nintendo 64 in those regions. Unfortunately, the public hands from the rest of the world never got to touch the system back then, so it is considered to be a collectors' item to them. Only about 22 games were released for the Virtual Boy, before it faded away less than a year later.[CR]I also made a few minor changes to the base 8-bit Panda game.</plot>

    <plot>8 Bit Panda is a classic-style platformer for the TIC-80. You can move, run, jump and get powerups (and occasionally fly planes!). It has 17 levels distributed across 6 major areas (isles). Each area has  different enemies and difficulty. The game is saved every time you complete a full area (after level 3 of each isle).[CR]This project is open source and available at:[CR]https://github.com/btco/panda[CR]Follow me on twitter: @btco_code (http://twitter.com/btco_code)</plot>

Yet only in 2027, in a sudden flash of enlightenment, Dr. P.Golabek of CDDA Labs realized the true potential hidden in the unloved part of his meal. There was more to the boiled curd of the brassica oleracea than what it seemed on the surface. The discovery didn't go unnoticed, and instead of bringing prosperity and nutrition, the wondrous plant became outlawed along with significant number of unrelated species of brassicaceae family.

    <plot>Hello. This is my first big game for Tic-80. It is a remake of an text adventure game for ZX-spectrum that has been created by a Czech programmer Frantisek Fuka (Fuxoft) in year 1985. I just polished the original idea and made better GUI so it would be easier to play this just by mouse.[CR]Controls:[CR]- mouse for selecting commands and objects from list[CR]- arrows for quick access to north, south, west and east directions[CR]Do not give up easily. There are lots of death traps, places you can get stuck when using items incorrectly and some red herrings. Game can be ended in more than one way! You get score and number of turns at the end when you get to the finish room. Have fun! </plot>

But worry not, because you are going to fix things now and defeat the great evil you unleashed upon the world.[CR]It's turn-based, so you have as long as you want to think things through and even in the heat of battle our monsters are well trained to wait, seemingly forever, until you have taken your turn.[CR]You start at the shores of Riverside with barely no equipment, a laughable budget and a desire for fame, fortune and making the world a better place. Let's see how this works out for you.[CR]Printable world map: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-9d8MZCrX5cdGBQ0LVlgSxD2lK6vp_zd[CR]This project is open source. The source code is at:[CR]https://github.com/btco/so12l[CR]*** SAVEGAME WARNING: Depending on your browser, the save game feature might not work (known issue on Chrome)! To test that it's working, reload the page after the intro screen. If you see "Save OK" on the top left, savegames are working. In any case, if you are playing this seriously, consider downloading the cart and playing in the TIC-80 program.[CR][ CONTROLS ][CR]    arrow keys: move[CR]    [Z]: menu / confirm[CR]    [X]: cancel / close[CR]At any time while adventuring you can bring up the game menu by pressing [Z] to allow you to: rest, cast spell, manage inventory and see detailed party info.[CR][ TIPS ][CR]0. To interact with things, just walk into them (huts, fountains, doors, etc, etc).[CR]1. To rest, use food rations: press Z to open menu, select ITEMS, select the food ration, press Z and select USE.[CR]2. Always carry plenty of food. Buy them in General Stores.[CR]3. Always carry plenty of torches to light dark caves and dungeons. Also found in General Stores.[CR]4. Upgrade equipment! You won't go very far with just a dagger and no armor.[CR]5. Save at every opportunity. Fountains and inns allow you to save.[CR]6. Beware of unidentified items. They may be cursed, explode, release poison gas, and all sorts of other bad effects. Plus, if you equip a cursed item, you won't be able to remove it.[CR]7. When you get enough XP, go to a town to train to level up. You will know you have enough XP because the XP meter on the bottom right will be highlighted with an up arrow.[CR][ TECHNICAL DETAILS ][CR]The game engine is 64K of Lua code but the core of the game's logic is written in XL, an assembly-like language I created, which assembles to bytecode that gets put into the cart's Map memory banks (banks 6 and 7). You can look at the XL source code in https://github.com/btco/so12l/tree/master/xl . It looks something like this:[CR]PROC WRLD_RS_OldWizardHut[CR] TEST GM_R_MYRA; JNZ .quest_r[CR] TEST GM_C_MYRA; JNZ .quest_c[CR] SND 251 .old_wiz .quest_msg[CR] SYS SYSC_SPEAK[CR] SND 251 .old_wiz .quest_msg2[CR] SYS SYSC_SPEAK[CR] SND 0 0 .quest_narr[CR] SYS SYSC_SPEAK[CR] OR GM_A_MYRA[CR] ...[CR]END[CR]The assembler that takes that and converts to bytecode is in https://github.com/btco/so12l/blob/master/tools/xlasm .

[CR]Anyway the game is a clone of Taito's Space Invaders using nothing but print() and font() for graphics (font() is limited to Block Elements which are are common feature in 8 bit computers but are absent from the tic.

Revives/kills a single cell (using left/right mouse buttons -- can be made bigger/smaller with W and S)[CR]    R/C/L - Rectangle/Circle/Line tools.[CR]    2-6 - Pattern tool, which gives you some premade patterns you can use.[CR]    F - Fill tool[CR]    E - Toggle draw/eraser mode.[CR]About the UI: top left is the number of generations that have passed. Top right is number of cells: living/dead/total.
