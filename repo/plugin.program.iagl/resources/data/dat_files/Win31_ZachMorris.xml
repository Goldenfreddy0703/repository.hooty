		<emu_comment>Windows 3.1x (codenamed Janus) is a series of 16-bit operating environments produced by Microsoft for use on personal computers. The series began with Windows 3.1, which was first sold during April 1992 as a successor to Windows 3.0. Subsequent versions were released between 1992 and 1994 until the series was superseded by Windows 95. During its lifespan, Windows 3.1 introduced several enhancements to the still MS-DOS-based platform, including improved system stability, expanded support for multimedia, TrueType fonts, and workgroup networking.[CR]As the first versions of Windows to enjoy major commercial success and software support, Windows 3.1 quickly replaced DOS as the platform for application software on PC compatibles. Multimedia software (especially games) proliferated, although many games continued to run on DOS until Windows 95.</emu_comment>

			<plot>skifree is the standalone version of the game originally included as a part of the microsoft entertainment pack 3 (1991) for windows 3.x, and later made available separately for windows 3.x. it was then re-compiled for 32-bit windows systems when the author found back the source code and released it for free through his website. players control a skier on a downhill slope on a mountain. from the start, three types of courses can be selected, but these can also be ignored. in slalom, the skier needs to pass flags on the right side and makes his way down to the finish. tree slalom is identical, but has a lot of trees on the course. the final one is freestyle were points are scored by performing jumps and doing tricks in the air, followed by a safe landing. the skier can be steered using the keyboard or the mouse. it is also possible to jump, but the biggest ones are achieved with the help of rocks, bumps and rainbow-coloured pads. after the finish, the skier can move on until he is caught by the abominable snow monster. there are various obstacles, such as trees, snowboarders, rocks and more.</plot>

			<plot>each level of this abstract puzzler challenges the player to set up a network of pipes to allow an unspecified substance known as 'flooz' to flow through as many of those as possible. the pieces are offered in random order, and there are seven different types - straight lines going horizontally or vertically, corners rotating in each of the four directions, and cross-over pieces which carry the flooz straight across horizontally and vertically. each of these can be entered from either side. when the flooz hits a gap, or a piece which the previous piece can't flow into, the pipe is finished. before the flooz starts flowing from its randomly-selected starting position, the player has several seconds to start placing pieces. they can be put down anywhere. however a situation that can often occur is there will be a long and complex piping arrangement set up, yet a gap somewhere remains to be filled. players are able to replace a piece with another in the same square (to make it easier to flow the flooz that way), but for a slight scoring penalty. bonuses are awarded for looping the flooz through both sides of at least 5 cross-over pieces, or passing the flooz through every square on the screen. later levels have some squares on the grid blocked off, a few gaps in the side-wall (allowing flooz to thread to the other side of the screen). after every four levels there is a bonus game for points, in which the player can only place the pieces in the lowest open space in each column, similarly to the board game of "connect 4".</plot>

			<plot>an enemy armada is invading the united federation of planets and starfleet command estimates that earth will be attacked in about a month. so the player, controlling james t. kirk, commander of the original ncc-1701 enterprise, is ordered to stop that invasion. wintrek is star trek simulation game, where the player virtually controls every aspect of the enterprise, including those that would normally be done by the crew. for navigating the enterprise through the sectors and quadrants, the player does not "drive" her, but instead controls the navigation station directly (setting course, whereby any of the 360 degrees can be used, and setting speed limits, both impulse and warp). during combat, the player has to manage shields, coordinate phaser fire and photon torpedoes, including the control of how much dilithium (fuel) is invested into shields and weapons. finally, the player must manage the dilithium fuel (i.e. refilling at starbases) and make sure that the ship doesn't break apart (damage system). the game is won when the enemy armada is destroyed, and lost when the armada attacks earth, or when the player-controlled ship runs out of fuel or explodes. both the number of enemy ships and the days available to the player are randomly set when the game is started. the game offers six difficulty levels, ranging from admiral (expert) to expandable crewman (easiest). in-game computer station acts like a computer operation system, allowing the player to get information not visible at the other stations (e.g. retrieve the position of the starbases). information is displayed in 11 sub-windows of the game window, which are all re-sizable and movable.</plot>

			<plot>borrowing certain gameplay conventions from qix, jezzball presents another scenario forcing the player to divide and conquer a 2d playfield by whittling away slivers of it until it is at only 25% (or less) of its original size. the complicating factor here are balls, more with every level, bouncing off the edges of the continuous playfield and, incidentally, quite lethal to the player's marker, only tangible while in the act of diminishing the playfield by marking off areas no longer to be used. the player can choose to trim horizontal or vertical segments -- depending on which axis they expect the bouncing ball to intercept soonest -- and the boring apparatus used fires off in opposite directions simultaneously, meaning the cross-section generally starts being cut from the middle and works its way toward the outside edges... all while keeping an eye on how close those balls are bouncing. the apparatus is slow, and until the entire cross-section is completed, its entire span is at risk of being hit. the two sides of the dividing sweep are independent from each other, so if one side is intercepted by a ball while in the process of trimming, the other side continues unabated, resulting in a half-complete division. this game became famous after being distributed as part of the microsoft entertainment pack 4 of windows 3.x games, returning in the best of microsoft entertainment pack.</plot>

			<plot>columns is a single player, falling block puzzle which describes itself as being based on macintosh columns by chris christensen which, this game claims, was itself based on xcolumns by jay geertson. the game consists of blocks which themselves consist of three coloured squares. all blocks are the same shape but the coloured squares they contain will vary. the player can position the blocks with the left/right keys, rotate the coloured squares within the block with the up key, and drop the block with the down key. the object is to align the colours so that three or more in a vertical, horizontal, or diagonal line are all of the same colour, when this happens they flash and disappear causing the squares above to drop down. the process repeats until either the player gets bored or the screen fills up.</plot>

			<plot>aliens is a single player shareware game based on taito's space invaders. as with the classic space invaders game the player has a canon which they can move to the right and left along the base of the game window. the canon fires upwards at the descending alien ships. this game varies from the original game in a number of ways:   * here there are no buildings to hide behind.   * in another variation from the original game the alien ships land  and steal the planets resources, these ships must be destroyed once  they take-off as if they reach the top of the screen the players  score is reduced.   * finally, the player must protect defending craft as they take-off.  shooting these down by mistake also reduces the player's score  the game is entirely keyboard controlled. the player's score is displayed in the game's title bar as the game progresses, there is no high score feature.</plot>

			<plot>a young physics professor named lester conducts a particle experiment. suddenly, something goes wrong, a lightning strikes, and in a moment lester finds himself in a strange alien world. now he must fight for his life, first with his bare hands, then with a gun he finds. but what gives him courage is that he is not alone. one of the aliens who escapes from the prison together with him helps him on his dangerous quest. friendship can overcome all the obstacles. out of this world combines shooting, platforming, and puzzle-solving elements. the game is divided into stages; some of them are straightforward and can only be accessed one time, while others are connected to each other, constituting a larger environment. exploration and problem-solving are emphasized. many levels include challenges not seen in the previous ones. tasks may involve environmental puzzles, timed sequences, precise jumping, and combat. typically, enemies are defeated by using an energy gun found in an early stage. the gun's regular function is shooting energy projectiles. by pressing down and holding the fire button the player can activate an energy shield which protects lester from regular attacks, allowing him to fire from relative safety until it evaporates. finally, by holding the fire button even longer the gun creates powerful blasts which can disrupt shields. most enemies are equipped with similar guns and are able to perform the same actions as lester. fighting enemies therefore requires tactical usage of regular attacks, shields, and bombs, as well as learning enemy patterns. each level can be accessed by typing a code the player learns after having completed the level. if lester dies, the level must be restarted. there is no on-screen interface and no in-game dialogue in the game. vector graphics are used for creating the game's environments and animated cutscenes.</plot>

			<plot>world empire iii is a risk-like strategy game where the ultimate goal is world conquest. up to eight human/computer players are assigned a starting country, either at random or by selection. there are some 139 real world nations to choose from. each country is assigned an ideology. nations with the same ideology as yours will be easier to conquer and occupy, while nations with different ideologies will put up greater resistance. ideological factions include the populists, militarists, socialists, realists, pacifists, optimists, pessimists, and feminists. there are two modes of play: standard and real world simulation. the standard game plays out similarly to risk. real world simulation mode adds a number of details, including population, industrial/agricultural/gasoline production, infantry/mechanized/tactical air support, and less randomness in battle resolutions.</plot>

			<plot>chinese solitaire is a single player card game. superficially the game resembles klondike solitaire in that some of the cards are face up and they are built into sequences of descending rank and alternating colour. forty-nine cards are dealt into seven stacks of seven cards. the first four stacks are dealt face up, the remainder have three cards face down and four cards face up. cards can be moved between the stacks either singly or on blocks, the only rule being that the card selected must be placed on a card of the opposite colour and one higher in rank - so a seven of hearts could be placed on the eight of spades for example. an empty stack can only be filled by moving a king into it. the object is to transfer all the cards to the foundations building from ace to the king, the author states that with practice this can be achieved in around one hand in three. the game has no undo feature, no hint feature, and is played entirely with the mouse</plot>

			<plot>following in the footsteps of the early unix game robots (and perhaps from there the still-earlier basic game chase?), this game puts the player in charge of a little protagonist, often claimed to be the doctor, occupying a position on a top-down grid which is otherwise strewn, not with mines, but with those killer cyborgs which are his personal nemesis, the daleks. they have no long-range weapons, but if they touch him, he will find himself ex-ter-min-ated! fortunately for him, contact with them is as lethal to each other as it is to him. every time he takes a step, they all draw one square closer to him; the doctor's cunning strategy is to manoeuvre himself so as to cause their paths to intersect and the daleks to terminally collide, leaving a pile of rubble dangerous both to him and to subsequent daleks -- a strategy not always possible on the narrow confines of a grid. fortunately for the good doctor, where this game outdoes its predecessors is that he also has his trusty sonic screwdriver in hand, whose offensive use destroys all daleks within a threatening one-square radius of him. also, it allows him to teleport out of harm's way to a random location on the map -- hopefully one behind a pile of dalek rubble, and not one within a single step of a dalek currently on the map. in many versions both sonic screwdriver and teleport use are limited. should the doctor survive this onslaught, he is brought to a new grid map, generally one populated with still further daleks. other features particular to some versions and absent from others include the use of graphical tiles vs. mere roguelike textmode character representation, and occasionally a conversion will use (universally unlicensed) sound effects taken from canonical doctor who sources; more commonly these games also offer a last stand command, to be used, like the "drop" in tetris, when the player is so confident in the security of their location that they are willing to sit tight and grant the daleks as many moves as it takes to either reach the doctor or be rendered down into scrap metal through unforeseen collision. successful use of the last stand often results in a score bonus; unsuccessful use of it, of course, results in the doctor's death. (don't worry, chances are good that he'll regenerate into a new incarnation -- not in this game, however). some versions feature keyboard directional control (in which sometimes the player is granted access to diagonal movement like the daleks are, and sometimes not), while others present the doctor with a halo of directional arrows around him, to move him one step in the appropriate direction if an arrow is clicked upon. generally he also has the option of standing in place and passing a turn.</plot>

			<plot>in the early '90s, the general public had been fed a great deal of propaganda about the fierceness of saddam hussein's republican guard, one of the top fighting forces in the world -- though, as it turns out, one with a glaring vulnerability to air power. in their successful attempt to oust the iraqi army from kuwait (being careful to leave saddam in power) through an overwhelming display of power, the coalition of the west in operation desert storm soon found their grizzled opponents only too eager to surrender and save their hides. this program commemorates their efforts, indicating a line of happily compliant soldiers, alive, in mental contrast to the stilled parade of "crispy critters" along the turkey shoot of the highway of death back to basra. to drive home the point of what a straw man the opposing forces ended up being, the program runs through to completion upon execution without any input needed from the player; however, if the author was more prescient, he might have instructed the program to lie dormant for twelve years and then fire up some horrifying no-win program like forbidden.exe or punishment for what john mccain suggests might be ten thousand years.</plot>

			<plot>tasholiiwe is a shareware computer conversion of a board game played by many tribes of native americans. the name is zuni, indian for "wooden dice" and is also their name for their version of the game, but it was also played -- with small differences -- by zuni, hopi, navajo, apache and others, probably dating back to the anasazi. the game is a simple "race and bump" game for four players (controlled by human players or the computer), where you have to complete a circuit on the board, a circle made of 40 stones (the "squares"), before the other players. the board is divided into four sets of 10 stones by four "gates" or "rivers". each player has a counter (a stick, or "horse"), which is moved by throwing three casting sticks, each with a red and a black side, and the number of black or red sides determines the count. the first player to complete the circuits wins. when you move your horse onto an opponent, he will be bumped back to the beginning, while when you land on a river, it's you who has to start all over. peculiar to the game is the fact that the moving direction is not predetermined; instead, you can choose your direction at the beginning, clockwise or counterclockwise. another interesting detail are the "anasazi facts" displayed from time to time, giving bits of information about native americans. tasholiiwe offers a variety of options, allowing you to play some of the variations used by specific tribes. the registered version enables betting on the outcome as well as a "contest" mode for multiple games.</plot>

			<plot>aliens is a single player shareware game based on taito's space invaders. as with the classic space invaders game the player has a canon which they can move to the right and left along the base of the game window. the canon fires upwards at the descending alien ships. this game varies from the original game in a number of ways:   * here there are no buildings to hide behind.   * in another variation from the original game the alien ships land  and steal the planets resources, these ships must be destroyed once  they take-off as if they reach the top of the screen the players  score is reduced.   * finally, the player must protect defending craft as they take-off.  shooting these down by mistake also reduces the player's score  the game is entirely keyboard controlled. the player's score is displayed in the game's title bar as the game progresses, there is no high score feature.</plot>

			<plot>columns is a single player, falling block puzzle which describes itself as being based on macintosh columns by chris christensen which, this game claims, was itself based on xcolumns by jay geertson. the game consists of blocks which themselves consist of three coloured squares. all blocks are the same shape but the coloured squares they contain will vary. the player can position the blocks with the left/right keys, rotate the coloured squares within the block with the up key, and drop the block with the down key. the object is to align the colours so that three or more in a vertical, horizontal, or diagonal line are all of the same colour, when this happens they flash and disappear causing the squares above to drop down. the process repeats until either the player gets bored or the screen fills up.</plot>

			<plot>battle sat is a shareware clone of the classic battleship board game. however, here the conflict has left the oceans and has instead gone to the skies above. the player takes turns against the computer's ai in a race to destroy the opponent's sats (or satellites). gameplay is very similar to the classic battleship - there are three grids on the screen: the left grid shows your opponent's playfield and tells you if you've hit one of his sats, or if you missed. the middle grid allows you to choose what area you will attack during your turn. the right grid displays your own sats, their status, and the places where the opponent has already attacked. this continues until one side loses all their sats. the main difference between the battleship board game and this windows-based implementation is that there are five sat pieces in play, all different sizes. while the board game has two pieces that are two blocks in size, this version contains one piece that's two blocks in size, and one piece that's one block in size.</plot>

			<plot>defendroid is a single player, windows port of the classic arcade game. it is an updated, renamed version of glen summers game defender. the gameplay is virtually identical to the earlier version but the graphics have been updated, the game has been renamed, and a new help system has been introduced. players fly over a mountainous side-scrolling landscape attempting to prevent aliens abducting people. when enemy ships are destroyed the people they were carrying must be collected before they plummet to earth. above the game area is a radar view of the game area so that the player can see where the enemies are and anticipate their arrival. the game gets progressively harder as the player moves up through the levels with later levels forsaking the earth altogether and being conducted in space against swarms of aliens. this game has some interesting features not usually found, for example the game can record and play back the last successful game, it can display the cpu resource usage, it also allows the player to configure the sound, the display and the controller and to create and configure patch files that affect the look and feel of the game.</plot>

			<plot>paulie python is a snake that is hungry for mice. your task is to guide the green python through various scrolling levels and eat all mice in each of them. however, the mice are often scattered around the level, so you have to search for them first. with each eaten mouse, paulie grows a bit, making it more difficult to avoid his own tail. you must neither crash into the tail nor the walls, otherwise you will lose a life. another hazard you might encounter are white balls that bounce around and kill your character when they hit his head. keep in mind that paulie's tail stays the same size when you advance to the next level. the same happens when paulie dies and has to restart a level, while all previously eaten mice reappear. this means that the python grows to an enormous size during the course of the game. you are awarded points for eating mice and bonus points when you beat a level, given that the bonus timer has not run out yet. the faster you clear a level, the more bonus points you earn, which are multiplied by the level number. when paulie runs out of lives, your game is over. if you got a high score, you can enter your name in the top five. the python can either be controlled by the arrow keys or by the mouse. for clearing a level of all mice, you either go to the next level in the given order or a random level is chosen, depending on the settings. it is also possible to freely choose a level. furthermore, you can adjust the difficulty by selecting between five different levels of speed. the registered version of this shareware game features the screensculptor, an editor which allows you to build your own levels.</plot>

			<plot>brain games for windows contains seven puzzle games bundled together. the games included are:   * achi - you play against the cpu. the game is similar to  tic-tac-toe; however, if a stalemate occurs, each player can move  one of their tiles and possibly get a game-winning line.   * bastille - the object of the game is to remove buttons from the  game board. you do so by moving one button over another; you can  only jump over one button at a time, and the place where you land  has to be empty. the game includes five different button patterns,  each one more difficult than the last.   * battle sat - originally released as a standalone game, this is a  battleship clone where you must shoot down your opponents  satellites before he shoots down your own. the game plays exactly  like battleship - you select points in a grid and fire at them. if  you land a hit, the point will turn red, and you'll have a clue as  to where the enemy's satellites are located. the player who  destroys the enemy's satellites first wins.   * double block - this is a simple memory game. you have to uncover  tiles and match them before your opponent does so you can win the  game. you can change the opponent's skill level and the colors used  in the grid; a single player mode is also available.   * jumper - a simple puzzle game, you have to move the red blocks on  the right side to the left side of the screen. the blocks will only  move if there is an empty space next to it, or if you've moved a  block right next to it.   * knight - the object of the game is to swap the position of the red  knights (on top) with the blue knights (below) in 16 moves by using  nothing but knight moves.   * tic-tac-toe - the classic game of tic-tac-toe. place xs or os in a  line across, down or diagonally before your opponent does the same.</plot>

			<plot>following in the footsteps of the early unix game robots (and perhaps from there the still-earlier basic game chase?), this game puts the player in charge of a little protagonist, often claimed to be the doctor, occupying a position on a top-down grid which is otherwise strewn, not with mines, but with those killer cyborgs which are his personal nemesis, the daleks. they have no long-range weapons, but if they touch him, he will find himself ex-ter-min-ated! fortunately for him, contact with them is as lethal to each other as it is to him. every time he takes a step, they all draw one square closer to him; the doctor's cunning strategy is to manoeuvre himself so as to cause their paths to intersect and the daleks to terminally collide, leaving a pile of rubble dangerous both to him and to subsequent daleks -- a strategy not always possible on the narrow confines of a grid. fortunately for the good doctor, where this game outdoes its predecessors is that he also has his trusty sonic screwdriver in hand, whose offensive use destroys all daleks within a threatening one-square radius of him. also, it allows him to teleport out of harm's way to a random location on the map -- hopefully one behind a pile of dalek rubble, and not one within a single step of a dalek currently on the map. in many versions both sonic screwdriver and teleport use are limited. should the doctor survive this onslaught, he is brought to a new grid map, generally one populated with still further daleks. other features particular to some versions and absent from others include the use of graphical tiles vs. mere roguelike textmode character representation, and occasionally a conversion will use (universally unlicensed) sound effects taken from canonical doctor who sources; more commonly these games also offer a last stand command, to be used, like the "drop" in tetris, when the player is so confident in the security of their location that they are willing to sit tight and grant the daleks as many moves as it takes to either reach the doctor or be rendered down into scrap metal through unforeseen collision. successful use of the last stand often results in a score bonus; unsuccessful use of it, of course, results in the doctor's death. (don't worry, chances are good that he'll regenerate into a new incarnation -- not in this game, however). some versions feature keyboard directional control (in which sometimes the player is granted access to diagonal movement like the daleks are, and sometimes not), while others present the doctor with a halo of directional arrows around him, to move him one step in the appropriate direction if an arrow is clicked upon. generally he also has the option of standing in place and passing a turn.</plot>

			<plot>mission alphatron is a variant of scramble. like in the arcade game the player controls a spaceship through a side scrolling cavern blasting everything in it's way. the ship has two weapons: a laser that can destroy anything that is in front of it and bombs that can be dropped on ground installations. there are several different types of enemies including rockets, missiles, mines and fighters. fuel is limited and can be replenished by shooting one of the many fuel tanks scattered throughout the game. if it runs out the ship will explode. other installations such as buildings and radar stations can also be destroyed the player has three lives and when they are gone the game is over. bombs can only be used in the original mtx release. in later ports only the laser is available.</plot>

			<plot>literati is a version of a 1990 dos shareware game that was converted and upgraded with more features for windows in 1994 for mvp software. in 2000, it became a popular part of the yahoo games web portal playable in a java format in a web browser. similar to scrabble, the gameplay involves placing letters from 7 tiles per player on a board and trying to accumulate the highest score possible. letters are distributed to players randomly and are worth between 1 and 5 points while blank tiles (one which is always given in first 7 tiles of the game) have no point value but can be made into any letter. the first word must be placed horizontally or vertically with one tile on the center square. subsequent words must use one letter of an existing word or be placed next to one so that any touching letters form valid words also. knowing the valid 2-letter words is very helpful in doing this. placing tiles on letter and word multiplier squares will increase your score and if you place all 7 tiles on the board at once, a 35-point bonus is given. a player can also choose to pass and select any of the letters in their pile to trade for new ones but loses their turn. at player first creates a table and can change its options for number of players, put a time limit and whether it is unrated or rated (the outcome will affect a person's overall rating). a challenge mode can also be set so that any word placed on the board can be challenged as to its validity by an opponent. if it is invalid the word is removed and the player who put it down loses their turn or else the challenger loses their next turn if the word is indeed valid. other players choose to join a table and press start to begin a game. when all tiles in the game are distributed and one player places all their remaining ones on the board or no-one can play any more tiles then the game is over. the sum of the letter values in each player's hand is subtracted from their score. if a player has no letters remaining, the sum of all of the letter values in the other players' hands are added to their score. the person with the highest score wins.</plot>

			<plot>winroids is a shareware asteroids clone where you have to destroy every asteroid on the level while avoiding being hit by the debris (asteroids get split into smaller parts when hit) and the occasional flying saucers. the game uses newtonian physics which means that you use your thrusters to accelerate in a direction, and the ship keeps moving in that direction and velocity - regardless of the current direction your ship is pointing - until you use your thrusters again to decelerate or change your direction. the levels are on a single screen with looped borders. anything that exits the screen on one side, will enter the screen on the other. this includes your own shots. apart from the random enemy ufos, there are also randomly appearing bonus crates containing extra lives, weapon upgrades and shield generators. the graphics are high resolution (for 1994) pre-rendered 2d sprites in cartoon or 50's sci-fi style.</plot>

			<plot>paulie python is a snake that is hungry for mice. your task is to guide the green python through various scrolling levels and eat all mice in each of them. however, the mice are often scattered around the level, so you have to search for them first. with each eaten mouse, paulie grows a bit, making it more difficult to avoid his own tail. you must neither crash into the tail nor the walls, otherwise you will lose a life. another hazard you might encounter are white balls that bounce around and kill your character when they hit his head. keep in mind that paulie's tail stays the same size when you advance to the next level. the same happens when paulie dies and has to restart a level, while all previously eaten mice reappear. this means that the python grows to an enormous size during the course of the game. you are awarded points for eating mice and bonus points when you beat a level, given that the bonus timer has not run out yet. the faster you clear a level, the more bonus points you earn, which are multiplied by the level number. when paulie runs out of lives, your game is over. if you got a high score, you can enter your name in the top five. the python can either be controlled by the arrow keys or by the mouse. for clearing a level of all mice, you either go to the next level in the given order or a random level is chosen, depending on the settings. it is also possible to freely choose a level. furthermore, you can adjust the difficulty by selecting between five different levels of speed. the registered version of this shareware game features the screensculptor, an editor which allows you to build your own levels.</plot>

			<plot>battle sat is a shareware clone of the classic battleship board game. however, here the conflict has left the oceans and has instead gone to the skies above. the player takes turns against the computer's ai in a race to destroy the opponent's sats (or satellites). gameplay is very similar to the classic battleship - there are three grids on the screen: the left grid shows your opponent's playfield and tells you if you've hit one of his sats, or if you missed. the middle grid allows you to choose what area you will attack during your turn. the right grid displays your own sats, their status, and the places where the opponent has already attacked. this continues until one side loses all their sats. the main difference between the battleship board game and this windows-based implementation is that there are five sat pieces in play, all different sizes. while the board game has two pieces that are two blocks in size, this version contains one piece that's two blocks in size, and one piece that's one block in size.</plot>

			<plot>the greens is a shareware arcade style crazy-golf game for 1 - 4 players. the game consists of a single screen with all the information presented in a series of windows. the main window in the upper left shows the position of the ball and the topography of the current hole. the player plays the game using a mouse to manipulate the three controls below the main window. the first control is a pair of arrows, one pointing up and one pointing down. this controls the strength of the putt. the second control is a white circle in a grey square. the white circle represents the ball and, using the mouse, the player positions a green dot which marks the direction from which the club will strike the ball. with the force and direction of the shot determined the player uses the third control to initiate the shot. an animation in the main window shows the track of the ball. each player has a total of eight strokes with which to complete the hole after which control passes to the next player. should the ball go into a bunker the ball is replaced at the start point. the object of the game is to complete the course in as few shots as possible. apart from the entry of the players names the game is entirely mouse controlled. it has an in-game help function, and a midi sound track and sound effects (both of which can be disabled) as well as a high score table. the shareware version of the game has five holes. the full version has eighteen holes and uses 256 colours.</plot>

			<plot>high command is a tactical strategy game. the game field, which looks a lot like minesweeper, is divided into squares. each square is either neutral, hostile or belongs to you. some squares are cities which have a high point value. your goal is to reach as much points as possible by conquer the enemy's squares and cities. similar to the board game risk you have to move soldiers from a bordering square into the hostile square to seize it. but there is a catch: not only the number of your and the enemy's troops in a square affect the chances - the troops in the bordering squares have a strong influence of the combat outcome too. the game features three enemy ais (aggressive, defensive and balanced), five historical and fictional scenarios. and an editor to build your own or random scenarios. the maximum number of war parties are 4, ai or human. in the shareware version you aren't allowed to save and there is only one scenario available.</plot>

			<plot>in this adventure game the player directs the actions of nightshade, a dragon of unusual coloration, as he escapes from a dungeon in castle lockemoer, "the palace of deceit", and attempts to revenge himself and his people against the sinister garth, a wizard attempting to rid the world of salac of its friendly draconians. nightshade was imprisoned in an attempt by garth to obtain the secret location of the hidden land of dragons through torture, and now nightshade will scour every square foot of garth's palace, from the subterranean mines to kitchens, libraries, gardens and torture chambers, to find what he needs to overthrow the genocidal garth: the lost sword of the great one. holding to certain interface conventions established earlier by icom's macventures and world builder games, this is largely achieved through pixel-hunting, sweeping the mouse over the screen in search of hot zones that change the mouse cursor into a new shape allowing him to pick up, converse with, operate or use an inventory item on the object beneath the cursor -- quite often a hidden switch revealing a hidden passageway.</plot>

			<plot>attaxx is a single player, shareware board game that plays just like the arcade game. each player starts with two pieces which are located on the corners of a 7x7 grid. players take turns to move a token either one or two fields (diagonal moves are allowed); if the piece is moved on a field which borders on the original field, a duplicate piece is created. when one or multiple of the opponent's pieces adjoin the new position, they are converted to the player's colour. moving is mandatory (unless there is no legal move possible) and the match is over as soon as all fields are filled up. the winner is the player who has more pieces on the board at this point. some fields on the board may be blocked off, these appear as a solid black cell in the grid, and a single player can compete against ai opponents of varying difficulty. the game is played entirely with the mouse, it keeps score of the games in a session but has no high score table. the starting board layout may vary with each game.</plot>

			<plot>paulie python is a snake that is hungry for mice. your task is to guide the green python through various scrolling levels and eat all mice in each of them. however, the mice are often scattered around the level, so you have to search for them first. with each eaten mouse, paulie grows a bit, making it more difficult to avoid his own tail. you must neither crash into the tail nor the walls, otherwise you will lose a life. another hazard you might encounter are white balls that bounce around and kill your character when they hit his head. keep in mind that paulie's tail stays the same size when you advance to the next level. the same happens when paulie dies and has to restart a level, while all previously eaten mice reappear. this means that the python grows to an enormous size during the course of the game. you are awarded points for eating mice and bonus points when you beat a level, given that the bonus timer has not run out yet. the faster you clear a level, the more bonus points you earn, which are multiplied by the level number. when paulie runs out of lives, your game is over. if you got a high score, you can enter your name in the top five. the python can either be controlled by the arrow keys or by the mouse. for clearing a level of all mice, you either go to the next level in the given order or a random level is chosen, depending on the settings. it is also possible to freely choose a level. furthermore, you can adjust the difficulty by selecting between five different levels of speed. the registered version of this shareware game features the screensculptor, an editor which allows you to build your own levels.</plot>

			<plot>paulie python is a snake that is hungry for mice. your task is to guide the green python through various scrolling levels and eat all mice in each of them. however, the mice are often scattered around the level, so you have to search for them first. with each eaten mouse, paulie grows a bit, making it more difficult to avoid his own tail. you must neither crash into the tail nor the walls, otherwise you will lose a life. another hazard you might encounter are white balls that bounce around and kill your character when they hit his head. keep in mind that paulie's tail stays the same size when you advance to the next level. the same happens when paulie dies and has to restart a level, while all previously eaten mice reappear. this means that the python grows to an enormous size during the course of the game. you are awarded points for eating mice and bonus points when you beat a level, given that the bonus timer has not run out yet. the faster you clear a level, the more bonus points you earn, which are multiplied by the level number. when paulie runs out of lives, your game is over. if you got a high score, you can enter your name in the top five. the python can either be controlled by the arrow keys or by the mouse. for clearing a level of all mice, you either go to the next level in the given order or a random level is chosen, depending on the settings. it is also possible to freely choose a level. furthermore, you can adjust the difficulty by selecting between five different levels of speed. the registered version of this shareware game features the screensculptor, an editor which allows you to build your own levels.</plot>

			<plot>the greens is a shareware arcade style crazy-golf game for 1 - 4 players. the game consists of a single screen with all the information presented in a series of windows. the main window in the upper left shows the position of the ball and the topography of the current hole. the player plays the game using a mouse to manipulate the three controls below the main window. the first control is a pair of arrows, one pointing up and one pointing down. this controls the strength of the putt. the second control is a white circle in a grey square. the white circle represents the ball and, using the mouse, the player positions a green dot which marks the direction from which the club will strike the ball. with the force and direction of the shot determined the player uses the third control to initiate the shot. an animation in the main window shows the track of the ball. each player has a total of eight strokes with which to complete the hole after which control passes to the next player. should the ball go into a bunker the ball is replaced at the start point. the object of the game is to complete the course in as few shots as possible. apart from the entry of the players names the game is entirely mouse controlled. it has an in-game help function, and a midi sound track and sound effects (both of which can be disabled) as well as a high score table. the shareware version of the game has five holes. the full version has eighteen holes and uses 256 colours.</plot>

			<plot>simon is a simple implementation of ralph baer's electronic game simon (itself an adaptation of atari's ill-fated touch me); iconic symbol of the '80s, the game rules are so primitive as to be practically instinctual -- each button is associated with a tone, and the player's goal is to reproduce button-sequences produced randomly by the computer, growing by an additional press with every iteration. the challenge lies in seeing for how long the player can faithfully reproduce the expanding sequences without making a mistake. unlike the original four-button simon machine, this game's interface has five buttons.</plot>

			<plot>a popular mahjongg adaptation, taipei has the player attempting to find matches between the oriental-motif patterns printed atop "free" (generally: exposed, on corners) tiles in various layered formations. matched pairs disappear, yielding different free tiles and further matching possibilities. ostensibly, the game is completed when all tiles are matched, though sometimes random tile placement results in unwinnable games. this game ended up, like many of its brethren, in pretty much every office in the nation courtesy of its inclusion in the microsoft entertainment pack for windows, and later the best of microsoft entertainment pack.</plot>

			<plot>this early, authorized freeware remake of the puzzle game from 1987 updates the graphics and sounds while maintaining the original gameplay. each level is a puzzle room filled with obstacles and viewed from above, where the objective is to use a series of mirrors to guide a laser beam towards a receiver device and complete the stage. the mirrors are stationary, but can be rotated to deflect the light to several directions, with some turning automatically all the time. the player must configure the mirrors and carefully avoid the mines and walls that reflect the laser back to itself, causing the emitting device to overload and explode. bomb detonators have to be activated and destroyed to open a passage to the receiver. other features change the behavior of the laser: the prism bends the light in random 90&#186; angles; the optical fiber nodes act as a portals, transporting the beam to another place of the board; logical doors have internal mirrors that absorb or deflect the laser when hit at the correct orientation. this remake received a new version in 2006.</plot>

			<plot>crowther and woods' trailblazing treasure-hunting cave-exploring text adventure game adventure is here presented in a new form. compiled from early fortran and c sources, this port makes use of its early gui by presenting a text output window, through which the game communicates to the player, as well as a player input window with buttons to streamline common commands (typically directional in nature) and a text entry box for more esoteric words (such as, for instance, "xyzzy".) the story and plot, such as it is (grab the treasures, try not to die) is much the same as other ports from its primeval source. this version, as do many, offers 350 points to be amassed through player action and treasure collection.</plot>
