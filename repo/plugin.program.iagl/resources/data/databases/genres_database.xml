		<plot>An arcade game or coin-op is a coin-operated entertainment machine typically installed in public businesses such as restaurants, bars and amusement arcades. Most arcade games are video games, pinball machines, electro-mechanical games, redemption games or merchandisers.[CR]The classic or golden age of arcade video games was the era when arcade video games entered pop culture and became a dominant cultural force. The exact time period is disputed, but key moments include the release of Space Invaders in 1978 and the vector-based Asteroids in 1979â€”moments made possible by the increase in power and decrease in cost of computing technology. This led to the rise of both video game arcades and video games in other media, such as songs, cartoons, and movies like 1982s TRON. Other iconic games from this era include Centipede, Defender, Donkey Kong, and Pac-Man.</plot>

		<plot>In video games, the first person refers to a graphical perspective rendered from the viewpoint of the players character. In many cases, this may be the viewpoint from the cockpit of a vehicle. Many different genres have made use of first-person perspectives, ranging from adventure games to flight simulators. The most notable genre to make use of this device is the first-person shooter, where the graphical perspective has a heavy impact on gameplay.</plot>

		<plot>2D, or two-dimensional, is the concept of everything being on one plane of existence. A being within a two-dimensional plane can only move along the horizontal X-axis and the vertical Y-axis. The Z-axis, which defines depth, is considered null. A classic example of two dimensional graphics and gameplay is Super Mario Bros, a side-scrolling platformer in which the player is limited to movement left, right, up, and down. The game popularized a school of game design that influenced its genre for generations.</plot>

		<plot>Today the term 2.5D is primarily used to described games that combine both modern 3D polygonal graphics and traditional 2D game-play. For example, a platformer or fighting game that uses 3D models, but with a fixed sideways perspective. However, 2.5D can be used to describe any game that combines both 2D and 3D techniques together.[CR]The term 2.5D has also been used to describe early first-person shooters that use 2D sprites instead of 3D models, such as Doom and Duke Nukem 3D. Usually referring to the actually engine used to make them. Since the 3D perspective was faked due to limitations with the technology of the time.</plot>

		<plot>Adding 3D to gaming has been one of the major paradigm shifts since the industrys conception. The addition of a Z plane has changed graphics and in turn the way games are played in every game that uses it. Like most major changes, the first games to highlight it were considered revolutionary and it spread from there.[CR]3D polygon graphics first appeared in arcades and computers during the 1980s, before making its way onto consoles in the 1990s. While 3D polygons had previously been used for arcade games like Winning Run (1988) and Hard Drivin (1989), the first mainstream success for 3D graphics was Segas revolutionary early 90s arcade hits like Virtua Racing (1992), Virtua Fighter (1993), and Daytona USA (1993). Soon after, 3D gained mainstream attention on consoles with the 1994 launch of the Sega Saturn and Sony PlayStation, both of which emphasized 3D as selling points. The next breakthrough came in 1996, when the Nintendo 64 launched with Super Mario 64, which gave gamers a new way to experience Mario and new controls that supported it, made possible by Nintendos revolutionary analog stick controller.</plot>

		<plot>Third-person is a perspective in which the player can visibly see the body of the controlled character. This is seen in most third-person shooters and adventure games. It most commonly refers to a viewpoint behind the player character.[CR]Third-person perspective puts you in direct control of a character that you can actually see in front of you. Third-person, in grammar is referred to as he, she or it. This means that you are not directly the person you are controlling. You do not control his thoughts or what he looks at (the first-person perspective, the you, gives you better control over putting you into someone else's body even if, in a grammar sense, it does not really count as first-person).</plot>

		<plot>Action games emphasize physical challenges that require eye-hand coordination and motor skill to overcome. They center around the player, who is in control of most of the action. Most of the earliest video games were considered action games; today, it is still a vast genre covering all games that involve physical challenges.[CR]Action games are classified by many subgenres. Platform games and fighting games are among the best-known subgenres, while shooter games became and continue to be one of the dominant genres in video gaming since the 1990s. Action games usually involve elements of twitch gameplay.</plot>

Traditional beat em ups take place in scrolling, two-dimensional (2D) levels, though some later games feature more open three-dimensional (3D) environments with yet larger numbers of enemies. These games are noted for their simple gameplay, a source of both critical acclaim and derision. Two-player cooperative gameplay and multiple player characters are also hallmarks of the genre. Most of these games take place in urban settings and feature crime-fighting and revenge-based plots, though some games may employ historical, science fiction or fantasy themes.</plot>

In video games, the central struggles of the game is typically resolved through drawing and playing cards.</plot>

These rows do not disappear, giving the player progressively less space and less time to play subsequent pieces.  The aim is also often to form complete layers.</plot>

		<plot>A side-scrolling game, or side-scroller, is a video game in which the gameplay action is viewed from a side-view camera angle, and the onscreen characters can generally only move to the left or right. These games make use of scrolling computer display technology. The move from single-screen or flip-screen graphics to scrolling graphics, during the golden age of video arcade games and during third-generation consoles, would prove to be a pivotal leap in game design.</plot>

		<plot>A VS game, or fighter game, is a video game genre in which the player controls an on-screen character and engages in close combat with an opponent, usually controlled by another player. The VS matches typically consist of several rounds and take place in an arena, while each character has differing abilities but each is relatively viable to choose. Players must master techniques such as blocking, counter-attacking, and chaining attacks together into combos. Starting in the early 1990s, most fighting games allowed the player to execute special attacks by performing specific input combinations. The VS game genre is related to but distinct from beat em ups, which involve large numbers of enemies against the human player.</plot>

		<plot>Sega AM2s first attempt in the 3D fighting genre was the 1993 arcade game Burning Rival, but gained renown with the release of Virtua Fighter for the same platform the same year. It was the first fighting game with 3D polygon graphics and a viewpoint that zoomed and rotated with the action. Despite the graphics, players were confined to back and forth motion as seen in other fighting games. With only three buttons, it was easier to learn than Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat, having six and five buttons respectively. By the time the game was released for the Sega Saturn in Japan, the game and system were selling at almost a one-to-one ratio.</plot>

		<plot>Flying games are a genre in which a character leaves the ground and propels itself in the air. Many things can take flight, be it a plane or a man wearing a jet pack.[CR]Video games let characters fly in ways that are not possible in the real world. Rocket boots are a popular example of this. Characters have rockets strapped to each of their legs and manages to fly around. This would not be possible in the real world as it would be very hard to make both rockets propel in exactly the same direction. Also, it would be impossible to fly anywhere but up.[CR]Finally, when developers lack inspiration as to how to make a character fly, they just make him fly. This can be thanks to magic or super powers like Superman. Sometimes, characters can fly thanks to some kind of wacky object like a hat with wings on it.</plot>

		<plot>Light gun shooter, also called light gun game or simply gun game, is a shooter video game genre in which the primary design element is aiming and shooting with a gun-shaped controller. Light gun shooters revolve around the protagonist shooting targets, either antagonists or inanimate objects. Light gun shooters generally feature action or horror themes and some may employ a humorous, parodic treatment of these conventions. These games typically feature on-rails movement, which gives the player control only over aiming.  The protagonists other movements are determined by the game. Games featuring this device are sometimes termed rail shooters, though this term is also applied to games of other genres in which on-rails movement is a feature. Some, particularly later, games give the player greater control over movement and in still others the protagonist does not move at all.</plot>

The primary objective of the game is to score as many points as possible. Many modern pinball machines include a story line where the player must complete certain objectives in a certain fashion to complete the story, usually earning high scores for different methods of completing the game. Points are earned when the ball strikes different targets on the play field. A drain is situated at the bottom of the play field, partially protected by player-controlled plastic bats called flippers. A game ends after all the balls fall into the drain a certain number of times.</plot>

The player may have unlimited time or infinite attempts to solve a puzzle, or there may be a time limit, or simpler puzzles may be made difficult by having to complete them in real time, as in Tetris.[CR]The genre is very broad, but it generally involves some level of abstraction and may make use of colors, shapes, numbers, physics, or complex rules. Unlike many video games, puzzle video games often challenge a player by limiting the number of tries. In puzzle video games, players often try for a high score or to progress to the next level by getting to a certain place or achieving some criteria.</plot>

		<plot>Rhythm game or rhythm action is a genre of music-themed action video game that challenges a players sense of rhythm. Games in the genre typically focus on dance or the simulated performance of musical instruments, and require players to press buttons in a sequence dictated on the screen. Doing so causes the games protagonist or avatar to dance or to play their instrument correctly, which increases the players score. Many rhythm games include multiplayer modes in which players compete for the highest score or cooperate as a simulated musical ensemble. While conventional control pads may be used as input devices, rhythm games often feature novel game controllers that emulate musical instruments. Certain dance-based games require the player to physically dance on a mat, with pressure-sensitive pads acting as the input device.</plot>

		<plot>The run and gun genre was popularized by Konamis classic Contra. Gunstar Heroes and Metal Slug are also among the most popular examples of this style. Side-scrolling run and gun games are an attempt to marry platform games with shoot em ups, characterized by a minimal focus on precise platform jumping and a major emphasis on multi-directional shooting. These games are sometimes called platform shooters. This genre has strong arcade roots, and as such, these games are generally known for being very difficult, and having very linear, one-way game progression.[CR]There are games which feature a heavy degree of shooting but do not fall into this subgenre. Mega Man, Metroid, Vectorman, Jazz Jackrabbit, Earthworm Jim and Turrican are all platformers with a heavy focus on action and shooting, but unlike Contra or Metal Slug, platform jumping elements, as well as exploration and back-tracking, still figure prominently. Run and guns are generally very pure, and while they may have vehicular sequences or other changes in style, they stay focused on shooting throughout.</plot>

		<plot>In shooter games (or simply shooters), players use ranged weapons to participate in the action, which takes place at a distance. Most shooters involve violent gameplay; lethal weaponry is used to damage opponents. However, some shooters, such as Splatoon, have non-violent objectives.[CR]Shooters, aside from subgenre classifications, can be further classified by their perspective of play. First-person shooters are played within the protagonists perspective; they often include a heads-up display displaying key information such as the current health of the protagonist. In third-person shooters, the protagonists body can be seen fully, the environment is rendered from a distance. Some shooters incorporate both perspectives.</plot>

		<plot>A simulation video game describes a diverse super-category of video games, generally designed to closely simulate real world activities.[CR]A simulation game attempts to copy various activities from real life in the form of a game for various purposes such as training, analysis, or prediction. Usually there are no strictly defined goals in the game, with the player instead allowed to control a character freely.  Well-known examples are war games, business games, and role play simulation.[CR]From three basic types of strategic, planning, and learning exercises: games, simulations, and case studies, a number of hybrids may be considered, including simulation games that are used as case studies.</plot>

		<plot>Some video games simulate the playing of sports. Most sports have been recreated by video games, including team sports, athletics and extreme sports. Some games emphasize playing the sport (such as the Madden NFL series), whilst others emphasize strategy and organization (such as Championship Manager). Some, such as Arch Rivals, satirize the sport for comic effect. This genre has been popular throughout the history of video games, and is competitive, just like real-world sports. A number of game series feature the names and characteristics of real teams and players, and are updated annually to reflect real-world changes.</plot>

		<plot>A stealth game is a type of video game in which the player primarily uses stealth to avoid or overcome antagonists. Games in the genre typically allow the player to remain undetected by hiding, sneaking, or using disguises. Some games allow the player to choose between a stealthy approach or directly attacking antagonists, but rewarding the player for greater use of stealth. The genre has employed espionage, counter-terrorism, and rogue themes, with protagonists who are special forces operatives, spies, thieves, ninjas, or assassins. Some games have also combined stealth elements with other genres, such as first-person shooters and platformers.</plot>
