Welcome to the New and Improved Otaku!

Hello Otaku Users,

We’re excited to introduce you to the latest version of Otaku! This update brings massive improvements, new features, and a more stable experience. The old Otaku has been fully upgraded to match Otaku Testing, ensuring better performance, more customization, and improved usability.


What’s New?

Expanded Content Selection – Now includes menus for Movies, TV Shows, TV Shorts, Specials, OVAs, ONAs, and Music Videos.

Debrid and Cloud Services Fixed – Thanks to @joezito129 and @adamosborne83, all services now work seamlessly.

Easy Debrid Support Added – Integration for a Easy Debrid.

Enhanced Filtering System – More refined scraping and improved search results.

MyAnimeList (MAL) Menus – Additional support alongside AniList menus.

New Sorting System – More precise control over how you organize your provider sources.

Performance Boost – Now supports Reuse Language Invoker for faster operation.

Greater Customization – Expanded settings for a more tailored experience.

Improved Playback – Faster loading for subtitles, audio, intro skip, and outro skip.

Watchlist Completion – Animes you finish will automatically be added to your completed watchlist.

Seamless Watchlist Migration – Existing watchlist settings will carry over without reconfiguration.

Fewer Metadata Issues – Database improvements have significantly reduced metadata errors by switching from AniList to MAL.

Uncached Sources Now Supported – Your Debrid Service can now download uncached sources.

Kodi 20+ Compatibility – The new Otaku is designed for the latest versions of Kodi. Note: Kodi 19 is not supported due to significant backend changes.


Why the Upgrade?

Eight months ago, we conducted a poll to determine how many users were still using Python 2 (Kodi 18 and older). Out of 75 votes, 72 users were on Python 3 (Kodi 19/20+), while only 3 remained on Python 2. Based on these results, we decided to focus on future-proofing Otaku by fully embracing Kodi 20 and beyond.
