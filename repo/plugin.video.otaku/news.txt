Welcome to the New Era of Otaku!

Hi everyone,

We’re thrilled to announce a major milestone: Otaku has officially migrated to its new version!
This is the biggest update in Otaku’s history, bringing over everything from Otaku Testing and making it the new standard.

What’s New?
- Expanded content: Movies, TV Shows, Shorts, Specials, OVAs, ONAs, and Music Videos
- Fully working Debrid & Cloud services (thanks to @joezito129 & @adamosborne83)
- Easy Debrid support
- Enhanced filtering & search for more accurate scraping
- MyAnimeList menus added alongside AniList
- New sorting system for finer control of sources
- Faster, smoother playback (subtitles, audio, intro/outro skip)
- Watchlist completion: finished anime auto-added to your completed list
- Seamless watchlist migration—no reconfiguration needed
- Uncached source support for Debrid services
- Kodi 20+ compatibility (Kodi 19 is no longer supported)

Why the Change?
After surveying our users, it became clear that almost everyone had already moved on from Python 2/Kodi 18. With this update, we’re fully embracing Kodi 20+, ensuring Otaku is future-proof, faster, and more reliable.

Thanks & Support
We want to thank the entire community for helping us get here, especially our contributors. If you encounter issues or want to share feedback, visit our wiki on Github

This migration marks a new era for Otaku, and we can’t wait to hear what you think. Happy watching!
