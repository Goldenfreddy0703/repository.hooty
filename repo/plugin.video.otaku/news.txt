Sad News: 
- Hey everyone, Weâ€™re sorry to announce that in the next 4 months or so, One of our main api's, Consumet will be shut down. Reason why it is shutting down is due to cost and bandwidth. You guys will still get episode meta from enime and simkl but you guys may have less embeds in the future. 

Good News:
- You guys can self-host the Consumet api yourselves which can give you old embeds and new emebeds. Special Intructions will be on the Otaku Settings, Github Wiki, or Troubleshooting page if you guys would like to self-host it.
